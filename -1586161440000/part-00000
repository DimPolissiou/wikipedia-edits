For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a  bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8\u22366, which is equivalent to the ratio 4\u22363). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6\u22368 (or 3\u22364) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8\u223614 (or 4\u22367).\n\nThe numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive.\n\nA ratio may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as \"''a'' to ''b''\" or \"''a''\u2236''b''\", or by giving just the value of their [[quotient]] {{nowrap|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}.<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>}} Equal quotients correspond to equal ratios.\n\nConsequently, a ratio may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with the first number in the numerator and the second as denominator, or as the value denoted by this fraction. Ratios of counts, given by (non-zero) [[natural number]]s, are [[rational number]]s, and may sometimes be natural numbers. When two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, their ratio is a [[dimensionless number]]. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with ''different'' units is called a [[rate (mathematics)|rate]].<ref>''\"The quotient of two numbers (or quantities); the relative sizes of two numbers (or quantities)\"'', \"The Mathematics Dictionary\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=UyIfgBIwLMQC&lpg=PA349&dq=dictionary%20ratio&pg=PA349#v=onepage&q=dictionary%20ratio&f=false]</ref>\n\n== Notation and terminology ==\nThe ratio of numbers ''A'' and ''B'' can be expressed as:<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n*the ratio of ''A'' to ''B''\n*''A''\u2236''B''\n*''A'' is to ''B'' (when followed by \"as ''C'' is to ''D''{{hair space}}\"; see below)\n*a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with ''A'' as numerator and ''B'' as denominator, that represents the quotient: ''A'' divided by ''B'': <math>\\tfrac{A}{B}</math>.

This latter form, when spoken or written in the English language, is often expressed as\n:(''A'' is to ''B'') as (''C'' is to ''D'').\n\n''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are called the terms of the proportion. ''A'' and ''D'' are called its ''extremes'', and ''B'' and ''C'' are called its ''means''. The equality of three or more ratios, like ''A''\u2236''B'' = ''C''\u2236''D'' = ''E''\u2236''F'', is called a '''continued proportion'''.<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nRatios are sometimes used with three or even more terms, e.g., the proportion for the edge lengths of a \"[[Dimensional lumber|two by four]]\" that is ten inches long is therefore\n:<math>\\text{thickness : width : length } = 2:4:10;</math>\n:(unplaned measurements; the first two numbers are reduced slightly when the wood is planed smooth)\n\na good concrete mix (in volume units) is sometimes quoted as\n:<math>\\text{cement : sand : gravel } = 1:2:4.</math><ref>[http://www.bellegroup.com/es/support/mixingHints.html Belle Group concrete mixing hints]</ref>\n\nFor a (rather dry) mixture of 4/1 parts in volume of cement to water, it could be said that the ratio of cement to water is 4\u22361, that there is 4 times as much cement as water, or that there is a quarter (1/4) as much water as cement.\n\nThe meaning of such a proportion of ratios with more than two terms is that the ratio of any two terms on the left-hand side makes up a standard proportion{{clarify|date=February 2020}} with the corresponding two terms on the right-hand side.\n\n==History and etymology==\nIt is possible to trace the origin of the word \"ratio\" to the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}} (''[[logos]]''). Early translators rendered this into [[Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]}}'' (\"reason\"; as in the word \"rational\"). A more modern interpretation{{Compared to?|date=October 2019}} of Euclid's meaning is more akin to computation or reckoning.<ref>Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia, p. 307</ref> Medieval writers used the word ''{{lang|la|proportio}}'' (\"proportion\") to indicate ratio and ''{{lang|la|proportionalitas}}'' (\"proportionality\") for the equality of ratios.<ref>Smith, p. 478</ref>\n\nEuclid collected the results appearing in the Elements from earlier sources. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] developed a theory of ratio and proportion as applied to numbers.<ref>Heath, p. 112</ref> The Pythagoreans' conception of number included only what would today be called rational numbers, casting doubt on the validity of the theory in geometry where, as the Pythagoreans also discovered, incommensurable ratios (corresponding to irrational numbers) exist. The discovery of a theory of ratios that does not assume commensurability is probably due to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The exposition of the theory of proportions that appears in Book VII of The Elements reflects the earlier theory of ratios of commensurables.<ref>Heath, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe existence of multiple theories seems unnecessarily complex to modern sensibility since ratios are, to a large extent, identified with quotients. This is a comparatively recent development however, as can be seen from the fact that modern geometry textbooks still use distinct terminology and notation for ratios and quotients. The reasons for this are twofold. First, there was the previously mentioned reluctance to accept irrational numbers as true numbers. Second, the lack of a widely used symbolism to replace the already established terminology of ratios delayed the full acceptance of fractions as alternative until the 16th century.<ref>Smith, p. 480</ref>\n\n===Euclid's definitions===\nBook V of [[Euclid's Elements]] has 18 definitions, all of which relate to ratios.<ref>Heath, reference for section</ref> In addition, Euclid uses ideas that were in such common usage that he did not include definitions for them. The first two definitions say that a ''part'' of a quantity is another quantity that \"measures\" it and conversely, a ''multiple'' of a quantity is another quantity that it measures. In modern terminology, this means that a multiple of a quantity is that quantity multiplied by an integer greater than one\u2014and a part of a quantity (meaning [[aliquot part]]) is a part that, when multiplied by an integer greater than one, gives the quantity.\n\nEuclid does not define the term \"measure\" as used here, However, one may infer that if a quantity is taken as a unit of measurement, and a second quantity is given as an integral number of these units, then the first quantity ''measures'' the second. These definitions are repeated, nearly word for word, as definitions 3 and 5 in book VII.\n\nDefinition 3 describes what a ratio is in a general way. It is not rigorous in a mathematical sense and some have ascribed it to Euclid's editors rather than Euclid himself.<ref>\"Geometry, Euclidean\" ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' p682.</ref> Euclid defines a ratio as between two quantities ''of the same type'', so by this definition the ratios of two lengths or of two areas are defined, but not the ratio of a length and an area. Definition 4 makes this more rigorous. It states that a ratio of two quantities exists when there is a multiple of each that exceeds the other. In modern notation, a ratio exists between quantities ''p'' and ''q'' if there exist integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''mp''>''q'' and ''nq''>''p''. This condition is known as the [[Archimedes property]].\n\nDefinition 5 is the most complex and difficult. It defines what it means for two ratios to be equal. Today, this can be done by simply stating that ratios are equal when the quotients of the terms are equal, but Euclid did not accept the existence of {{clarify|text=the quotients of incommensurate,|date=October 2019|reason=Do we accept the quotients of incommensurate? How many quotients does incommensurate have?}} so such a definition would have been meaningless to him. Thus, a more subtle definition is needed where quantities involved are not measured directly to one another. In modern notation, Euclid's definition of equality is that, given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', then ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''r''{{hair space}}\u2236''s'' if and only if, for any positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', ''np''<''mq'', ''np''=''mq'', or ''np''>''mq'' according as ''nr''<''ms'', ''nr''=''ms'', or ''nr''>''ms'', respectively.<ref>Heath p.114</ref> This definition has affinities with [[Dedekind cuts]] as, with ''n'' and ''q'' both positive, ''np'' stands to ''mq'' as {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} stands to the rational number {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} (dividing both terms by ''nq'').<ref>Heath p. 125</ref>\n\nDefinition 6 says that quantities that have the same ratio are ''proportional'' or ''in proportion''. Euclid uses the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd (analogon), this has the same root as \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and is related to the English word \"analog\".\n\nDefinition 7 defines what it means for one ratio to be less than or greater than another and is based on the ideas present in definition 5. In modern notation it says that given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', ''p''\u2236''q''>''r''\u2236''s'' if there are positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''np''>''mq'' and ''nr''\u2264''ms''.\n\nAs with definition 3, definition 8 is regarded by some as being a later insertion by Euclid's editors. It defines three terms ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' to be in proportion when ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''q''\u2236''r''. This is extended to 4 terms ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' as ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''q''\u2236''r''\u2237''r''\u2236''s'', and so on. Sequences that have the property that the ratios of consecutive terms are equal are called [[geometric progression]]s. Definitions 9 and 10 apply this, saying that if ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are in proportion then ''p''\u2236''r'' is the ''duplicate ratio'' of ''p''\u2236''q'' and if ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' are in proportion then ''p''\u2236''s'' is the ''triplicate ratio'' of ''p''\u2236''q''.\n\n==Number of terms and use of fractions==\nIn general, a comparison of the quantities of a two-entity ratio can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] derived from the ratio. For example, in a ratio of 2\u22363, the amount, size, volume, or quantity of the first entity is <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> that of the second entity.\n\nIf there are 2 oranges and 3 apples, the ratio of oranges to apples is 2\u22363, and the ratio of oranges to the total number of pieces of fruit is 2\u22365.  These ratios can also be expressed in fraction form: there are 2/3 as many oranges as apples, and 2/5 of the pieces of fruit are oranges.  If orange juice concentrate is to be diluted with water in the ratio 1\u22364, then one part of concentrate is mixed with four parts of water, giving five parts total; the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/4 the amount of water, while the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/5 of the total liquid.  In both ratios and fractions, it is important to be clear what is being compared to what, and beginners often make mistakes for this reason.\n\nFractions can also be inferred from ratios with more than two entities; however, a ratio with more than two entities cannot be completely converted into a single fraction, because a fraction can only compare two quantities. A separate fraction can be used to compare the quantities of any two of the entities covered by the ratio: for example, from a ratio of 2\u22363\u22367 we can infer that the quantity of the second entity is <math>\\tfrac{3}{7}</math> that of the third entity.\n\n==Proportions and percentage ratios==\nIf we multiply all quantities involved in a ratio by the same number, the ratio remains valid. For example, a ratio of 3\u22362 is the same as 12\u22368. It is usual either to reduce terms to the [[lowest common denominator]], or to express them in parts per hundred ([[percent]]).\n\nIf a mixture contains substances A, B, C and D in the ratio 5\u22369\u22364\u22362 then there are 5 parts of A for every 9 parts of B, 4 parts of C and 2 parts of D.  As 5+9+4+2=20, the total mixture contains 5/20 of A (5 parts out of 20), 9/20 of B, 4/20 of C, and 2/20 of D.  If we divide all numbers by the total and multiply by 100, we have converted to [[percentages]]: 25% A, 45% B, 20% C, and 10% D (equivalent to writing the ratio as 25\u223645\u223620\u223610).\n\nIf the two or more ratio quantities encompass all of the quantities in a particular situation, it is said that \"the whole\" contains the sum of the parts: for example, a fruit basket containing two apples and three oranges and no other fruit is made up of two parts apples and three parts oranges. In this case, <math>\\tfrac{2}{5}</math>, or 40% of the whole is apples and <math>\\tfrac{3}{5}</math>, or 60% of the whole is oranges. This comparison of a specific quantity to \"the whole\" is called a proportion.\n\nIf the ratio consists of only two values, it can be represented as a fraction, in particular as a decimal fraction. For example, older [[television]]s have a 4\u22363 ''[[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]'', which means that the width is 4/3 of the height (this can also be expressed as 1.33\u22361 or just 1.33 rounded to two decimal places). More recent widescreen TVs have a 16\u22369 aspect ratio, or 1.78 rounded to two decimal places. One of the popular widescreen movie formats is 2.35\u22361 or simply 2.35. Representing ratios as decimal fractions simplifies their comparison. When comparing 1.33, 1.78 and 2.35, it is obvious which format offers wider image. Such a comparison works only when values being compared are consistent, like always expressing width in relation to height.\n\n==Reduction==\nRatios can be [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduced]] (as fractions are) by dividing each quantity by the common factors of all the quantities. As for fractions, the simplest form is considered that in which the numbers in the ratio are the smallest possible integers.\n\nThus, the ratio 40\u223660 is equivalent in meaning to the ratio 2\u22363, the latter being obtained from the former by dividing both quantities by 20. Mathematically, we write 40\u223660 = 2\u22363, or equivalently 40\u223660\u22372\u22363. The verbal equivalent is \"40 is to 60 as 2 is to 3.\"\n\nA ratio that has integers for both quantities and that cannot be reduced any further (using integers) is said to be in [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]] or lowest terms.\n\nSometimes it is useful to write a ratio in the form 1\u2236''x'' or ''x''\u22361, where ''x'' is not necessarily an integer, to enable comparisons of different ratios. For example, the ratio 4\u22365 can be written as 1\u22361.25 (dividing both sides by 4) Alternatively, it can be written as 0.8\u22361 (dividing both sides by 5).\n\nWhere the context makes the meaning clear, a ratio in this form is sometimes written without the 1 and the ratio symbol (\u2236), though, mathematically, this makes it a [[divisor|factor]] or [[Multiplication|multiplier]].\n\n==Irrational ratios==\nRatios may also be established between [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] quantities (quantities whose ratio, as value of a fraction, amounts to an [[irrational number]]). The earliest discovered example, found by the [[Pythagoreans]], is the ratio of the length of the diagonal {{mvar|d}} to the length of a side {{mvar|s}} of a [[square]], which is the [[square root of 2]], formally <math>a:d = 1:\\sqrt{2}.</math> Another example is the ratio of a [[circle]]'s circumference to its diameter, which is called [[pi|{{pi}}]], and is not just an [[algebraic number|algebraically irrational number]], but a [[transcendental number|transcendental irrational]].\n\nAlso well known is the [[golden ratio]] of two (mostly) lengths {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, which is defined by the proportion\n: <math>a:b = (a+b):a \\quad</math> or, equivalently <math>\\quad a:b = (1+b/a):1.</math>\nTaking the ratios as fractions and <math>a:b</math> as having the value {{mvar|x}}, yields the equation\n:<math>x=1+\\tfrac 1x \\quad</math> or <math>\\quad x^2-x-1 = 0,</math>\nwhich has the positive, irrational solution <math>x=\\tfrac{a}{b}=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.</math>\nThus at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' has to be irrational for them to be in the golden ratio. An example of an occurrence of the golden ratio in math is as the limiting value of the ratio of two consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s: even though all these ratios are ratios of two integers and hence are rational, the limit of the sequence of these rational ratios is the irrational golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the [[silver ratio]] of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is defined by the proportion\n:<math>a:b = (2a+b):a \\quad (= (2+b/a):1),</math> corresponding to <math>x^2-2x-1 = 0.</math> \nThis equation has the positive, irrational solution <math>x = \\tfrac{a}{b}=1+\\sqrt{2},</math>  so again at least one of the two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' in the silver ratio must be irrational.\n\n==Odds==\n{{Main|Odds}}\n''Odds'' (as in gambling) are expressed as a ratio.  For example, odds of \"7 to 3 against\" (7\u22363) mean that there are seven chances that the event will not happen to every three chances that it will happen.  The probability of success is 30%.  In every ten trials, there are expected to be three wins and seven losses.\n\n==Units==\nRatios may be [[Dimensionless quantity|unitless]], as in the case they relate quantities in units of the same [[dimensional analysis|dimension]], even if their [[units of measurement]] are initially different.\nFor example, the ratio {{nowrap|1 minute \u2236 40 seconds}} can be reduced by changing the first value to 60 seconds, so the ratio becomes {{nowrap|60 seconds \u2236 40 seconds}}. Once the units are the same, they can be omitted, and the ratio can be reduced to 3\u22362.\n\nOn the other hand, there are non-dimensionless ratios, also known as [[rate (mathematics)|rates]].<ref>''\"'Velocity' can be defined as the ratio... 'Population density' is the ratio... 'Gasoline consumption' is measure as the ratio...\"'', \"Ratio and Proportion: Research and Teaching in Mathematics Teachers\"  [https://books.google.com/books?id=eawKLY71xvkC&lpg=PP1&dq=ratio&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=perspective&f=false]</ref><ref>''\"''Ratio as a Rate''.

This cannot be converted to a dimensionless ratio, as in weight/weight or volume/volume fractions.\n\n==Triangular coordinates==\n\n<!-- In this section, the ratio symbol U+2236 (\u2236) is used for ratios, colons (:) for trilinear coordinates, and commas (see File:TriangleBarycentricCoordinates.svg in Commons) for barycentric coordinates.  -->\n\nThe locations of points relative to a triangle with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' and sides ''AB'', ''BC'', and ''CA''  are often expressed in extended ratio form as ''triangular coordinates''.\n\nIn [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]], a point with coordinates ''&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;'' is the point upon which a weightless sheet of metal in the shape and size of the triangle would exactly balance if weights were put on the vertices, with the ratio of the weights at ''A'' and ''B'' being ''&alpha;'' \u2236 ''&beta;'', the ratio of the weights at ''B'' and ''C'' being ''&beta;'' \u2236 ''&gamma;'', and therefore the ratio of weights at ''A'' and ''C'' being ''&alpha;'' \u2236 ''&gamma;''.\n\nIn [[trilinear coordinates]], a point with coordinates ''x''{{hair space}}:''y''{{hair space}}:''z'' has [[perpendicular]] distances to side ''BC'' (across from vertex ''A'') and side  ''CA'' (across from vertex ''B'') in the ratio ''x''{{hair space}}\u2236''y'', distances to side ''CA'' and side ''AB'' (across from ''C'') in the ratio ''y''{{hair space}}\u2236''z'', and therefore distances to sides ''BC'' and ''AB'' in the ratio ''x''{{hair space}}\u2236''z''.\n\nSince all information is expressed in terms of ratios (the individual numbers denoted by ''&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, x, y,'' and ''z'' have no meaning by themselves), a triangle analysis using barycentric or trilinear coordinates applies regardless of the size of the triangle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dilution ratio]]\n*[[Displacement\u2013length ratio]]\n*[[Dimensionless quantity]]\n*[[Financial ratio]]\n*[[Fold change]]\n*[[Interval (music)]]\n*[[Odds ratio]]\n*[[Parts-per notation]]\n*[[Price\u2013performance ratio]]\n*[[Proportionality (mathematics)]]\n*[[Ratio distribution]]\n*[[Ratio estimator]]\n*[[Rate (mathematics)]]\n*[[Rate ratio]]\n*[[Relative risk]]\n*[[Rule of three (mathematics)]]\n*[[Scale (map)]]\n*[[Sex ratio]]\n*[[Slope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 \"Ratio\" ''The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia'' vol. 19], The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London pp.&nbsp;307ff\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgAoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA270 \"Proportion\" ''New International Encyclopedia, Vol. 19'' 2nd ed.

For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a  bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8\u22366, which is equivalent to the ratio 4\u22363). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6\u22368 (or 3\u22364) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8\u223614 (or 4\u22367).\n\nThe numbers in a ratio may be quantities of any kind, such as counts of people or objects, or such as measurements of lengths, weights, time, etc. In most contexts, both numbers are restricted to be positive.\n\nA ratio may be specified either by giving both constituting numbers, written as \"''a'' to ''b''\" or \"''a''\u2236''b''\", or by giving just the value of their [[quotient]] {{nowrap|{{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}.<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>}} Equal quotients correspond to equal ratios.\n\nConsequently, a ratio may be considered as an ordered pair of numbers, as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with the first number in the numerator and the second as denominator, or as the value denoted by this fraction. Ratios of counts, given by (non-zero) [[natural number]]s, are [[rational number]]s, and may sometimes be natural numbers. When two quantities are measured with the same unit, as is often the case, their ratio is a [[dimensionless number]]. A quotient of two quantities that are measured with ''different'' units is called a [[rate (mathematics)|rate]].<ref>''\"The quotient of two numbers (or quantities); the relative sizes of two numbers (or quantities)\"'', \"The Mathematics Dictionary\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=UyIfgBIwLMQC&lpg=PA349&dq=dictionary%20ratio&pg=PA349#v=onepage&q=dictionary%20ratio&f=false]</ref>\n\n== Notation and terminology ==\nThe ratio of numbers ''A'' and ''B'' can be expressed as:<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n*the ratio of ''A'' to ''B''\n*''A''\u2236''B''\n*''A'' is to ''B'' (when followed by \"as ''C'' is to ''D''{{hair space}}\"; see below)\n*a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with ''A'' as numerator and ''B'' as denominator, that represents the quotient: ''A'' divided by ''B'': <math>\\tfrac{A}{B}</math>.

This latter form, when spoken or written in the English language, is often expressed as\n:(''A'' is to ''B'') as (''C'' is to ''D'').\n\n''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' are called the terms of the proportion. ''A'' and ''D'' are called its ''extremes'', and ''B'' and ''C'' are called its ''means''. The equality of three or more ratios, like ''A''\u2236''B'' = ''C''\u2236''D'' = ''E''\u2236''F'', is called a '''continued proportion'''.<ref>New International Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nRatios are sometimes used with three or even more terms, e.g., the proportion for the edge lengths of a \"[[Dimensional lumber|two by four]]\" that is ten inches long is therefore\n:<math>\\text{thickness : width : length } = 2:4:10;</math>\n:(unplaned measurements; the first two numbers are reduced slightly when the wood is planed smooth)\n\na good concrete mix (in volume units) is sometimes quoted as\n:<math>\\text{cement : sand : gravel } = 1:2:4.</math><ref>[http://www.bellegroup.com/es/support/mixingHints.html Belle Group concrete mixing hints]</ref>\n\nFor a (rather dry) mixture of 4/1 parts in volume of cement to water, it could be said that the ratio of cement to water is 4\u22361, that there is 4 times as much cement as water, or that there is a quarter (1/4) as much water as cement.\n\nThe meaning of such a proportion of ratios with more than two terms is that the ratio of any two terms on the left-hand side makes up a standard proportion{{clarify|date=February 2020}} with the corresponding two terms on the right-hand side.\n\n==History and etymology==\nIt is possible to trace the origin of the word \"ratio\" to the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}} (''[[logos]]''). Early translators rendered this into [[Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|[[wikt:ratio#Latin|ratio]]}}'' (\"reason\"; as in the word \"rational\"). A more modern interpretation{{Compared to?|date=October 2019}} of Euclid's meaning is more akin to computation or reckoning.<ref>Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia, p. 307</ref> Medieval writers used the word ''{{lang|la|proportio}}'' (\"proportion\") to indicate ratio and ''{{lang|la|proportionalitas}}'' (\"proportionality\") for the equality of ratios.<ref>Smith, p. 478</ref>\n\nEuclid collected the results appearing in the Elements from earlier sources. The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] developed a theory of ratio and proportion as applied to numbers.<ref>Heath, p. 112</ref> The Pythagoreans' conception of number included only what would today be called rational numbers, casting doubt on the validity of the theory in geometry where, as the Pythagoreans also discovered, incommensurable ratios (corresponding to irrational numbers) exist. The discovery of a theory of ratios that does not assume commensurability is probably due to [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The exposition of the theory of proportions that appears in Book VII of The Elements reflects the earlier theory of ratios of commensurables.<ref>Heath, p. 113</ref>\n\nThe existence of multiple theories seems unnecessarily complex to modern sensibility since ratios are, to a large extent, identified with quotients. This is a comparatively recent development however, as can be seen from the fact that modern geometry textbooks still use distinct terminology and notation for ratios and quotients. The reasons for this are twofold. First, there was the previously mentioned reluctance to accept irrational numbers as true numbers. Second, the lack of a widely used symbolism to replace the already established terminology of ratios delayed the full acceptance of fractions as alternative until the 16th century.<ref>Smith, p. 480</ref>\n\n===Euclid's definitions===\nBook V of [[Euclid's Elements]] has 18 definitions, all of which relate to ratios.<ref>Heath, reference for section</ref> In addition, Euclid uses ideas that were in such common usage that he did not include definitions for them. The first two definitions say that a ''part'' of a quantity is another quantity that \"measures\" it and conversely, a ''multiple'' of a quantity is another quantity that it measures. In modern terminology, this means that a multiple of a quantity is that quantity multiplied by an integer greater than one\u2014and a part of a quantity (meaning [[aliquot part]]) is a part that, when multiplied by an integer greater than one, gives the quantity.\n\nEuclid does not define the term \"measure\" as used here, However, one may infer that if a quantity is taken as a unit of measurement, and a second quantity is given as an integral number of these units, then the first quantity ''measures'' the second. These definitions are repeated, nearly word for word, as definitions 3 and 5 in book VII.\n\nDefinition 3 describes what a ratio is in a general way. It is not rigorous in a mathematical sense and some have ascribed it to Euclid's editors rather than Euclid himself.<ref>\"Geometry, Euclidean\" ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' p682.</ref> Euclid defines a ratio as between two quantities ''of the same type'', so by this definition the ratios of two lengths or of two areas are defined, but not the ratio of a length and an area. Definition 4 makes this more rigorous. It states that a ratio of two quantities exists when there is a multiple of each that exceeds the other. In modern notation, a ratio exists between quantities ''p'' and ''q'' if there exist integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''mp''>''q'' and ''nq''>''p''. This condition is known as the [[Archimedes property]].\n\nDefinition 5 is the most complex and difficult. It defines what it means for two ratios to be equal. Today, this can be done by simply stating that ratios are equal when the quotients of the terms are equal, but Euclid did not accept the existence of {{clarify|text=the quotients of incommensurate,|date=October 2019|reason=Do we accept the quotients of incommensurate? How many quotients does incommensurate have?}} so such a definition would have been meaningless to him. Thus, a more subtle definition is needed where quantities involved are not measured directly to one another. In modern notation, Euclid's definition of equality is that, given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', then ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''r''{{hair space}}\u2236''s'' if and only if, for any positive integers ''m'' and ''n'', ''np''<''mq'', ''np''=''mq'', or ''np''>''mq'' according as ''nr''<''ms'', ''nr''=''ms'', or ''nr''>''ms'', respectively.<ref>Heath p.114</ref> This definition has affinities with [[Dedekind cuts]] as, with ''n'' and ''q'' both positive, ''np'' stands to ''mq'' as {{sfrac|''p''|''q''}} stands to the rational number {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} (dividing both terms by ''nq'').<ref>Heath p. 125</ref>\n\nDefinition 6 says that quantities that have the same ratio are ''proportional'' or ''in proportion''. Euclid uses the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd (analogon), this has the same root as \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and is related to the English word \"analog\".\n\nDefinition 7 defines what it means for one ratio to be less than or greater than another and is based on the ideas present in definition 5. In modern notation it says that given quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'', ''p''\u2236''q''>''r''\u2236''s'' if there are positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' so that ''np''>''mq'' and ''nr''\u2264''ms''.\n\nAs with definition 3, definition 8 is regarded by some as being a later insertion by Euclid's editors. It defines three terms ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' to be in proportion when ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''q''\u2236''r''. This is extended to 4 terms ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' as ''p''\u2236''q''\u2237''q''\u2236''r''\u2237''r''\u2236''s'', and so on. Sequences that have the property that the ratios of consecutive terms are equal are called [[geometric progression]]s. Definitions 9 and 10 apply this, saying that if ''p'', ''q'' and ''r'' are in proportion then ''p''\u2236''r'' is the ''duplicate ratio'' of ''p''\u2236''q'' and if ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''s'' are in proportion then ''p''\u2236''s'' is the ''triplicate ratio'' of ''p''\u2236''q''.\n\n==Number of terms and use of fractions==\nIn general, a comparison of the quantities of a two-entity ratio can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] derived from the ratio. For example, in a ratio of 2\u22363, the amount, size, volume, or quantity of the first entity is <math>\\tfrac{2}{3}</math> that of the second entity.\n\nIf there are 2 oranges and 3 apples, the ratio of oranges to apples is 2\u22363, and the ratio of oranges to the total number of pieces of fruit is 2\u22365.  These ratios can also be expressed in fraction form: there are 2/3 as many oranges as apples, and 2/5 of the pieces of fruit are oranges.  If orange juice concentrate is to be diluted with water in the ratio 1\u22364, then one part of concentrate is mixed with four parts of water, giving five parts total; the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/4 the amount of water, while the amount of orange juice concentrate is 1/5 of the total liquid.  In both ratios and fractions, it is important to be clear what is being compared to what, and beginners often make mistakes for this reason.\n\nFractions can also be inferred from ratios with more than two entities; however, a ratio with more than two entities cannot be completely converted into a single fraction, because a fraction can only compare two quantities. A separate fraction can be used to compare the quantities of any two of the entities covered by the ratio: for example, from a ratio of 2\u22363\u22367 we can infer that the quantity of the second entity is <math>\\tfrac{3}{7}</math> that of the third entity.\n\n==Proportions and percentage ratios==\nIf we multiply all quantities involved in a ratio by the same number, the ratio remains valid. For example, a ratio of 3\u22362 is the same as 12\u22368. It is usual either to reduce terms to the [[lowest common denominator]], or to express them in parts per hundred ([[percent]]).\n\nIf a mixture contains substances A, B, C and D in the ratio 5\u22369\u22364\u22362 then there are 5 parts of A for every 9 parts of B, 4 parts of C and 2 parts of D.  As 5+9+4+2=20, the total mixture contains 5/20 of A (5 parts out of 20), 9/20 of B, 4/20 of C, and 2/20 of D.  If we divide all numbers by the total and multiply by 100, we have converted to [[percentages]]: 25% A, 45% B, 20% C, and 10% D (equivalent to writing the ratio as 25\u223645\u223620\u223610).\n\nIf the two or more ratio quantities encompass all of the quantities in a particular situation, it is said that \"the whole\" contains the sum of the parts: for example, a fruit basket containing two apples and three oranges and no other fruit is made up of two parts apples and three parts oranges. In this case, <math>\\tfrac{2}{5}</math>, or 40% of the whole is apples and <math>\\tfrac{3}{5}</math>, or 60% of the whole is oranges. This comparison of a specific quantity to \"the whole\" is called a proportion.\n\nIf the ratio consists of only two values, it can be represented as a fraction, in particular as a decimal fraction. For example, older [[television]]s have a 4\u22363 ''[[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]'', which means that the width is 4/3 of the height (this can also be expressed as 1.33\u22361 or just 1.33 rounded to two decimal places). More recent widescreen TVs have a 16\u22369 aspect ratio, or 1.78 rounded to two decimal places. One of the popular widescreen movie formats is 2.35\u22361 or simply 2.35. Representing ratios as decimal fractions simplifies their comparison. When comparing 1.33, 1.78 and 2.35, it is obvious which format offers wider image. Such a comparison works only when values being compared are consistent, like always expressing width in relation to height.\n\n==Reduction==\nRatios can be [[Reduction (mathematics)|reduced]] (as fractions are) by dividing each quantity by the common factors of all the quantities. As for fractions, the simplest form is considered that in which the numbers in the ratio are the smallest possible integers.\n\nThus, the ratio 40\u223660 is equivalent in meaning to the ratio 2\u22363, the latter being obtained from the former by dividing both quantities by 20. Mathematically, we write 40\u223660 = 2\u22363, or equivalently 40\u223660\u22372\u22363. The verbal equivalent is \"40 is to 60 as 2 is to 3.\"\n\nA ratio that has integers for both quantities and that cannot be reduced any further (using integers) is said to be in [[Irreducible fraction|simplest form]] or lowest terms.\n\nSometimes it is useful to write a ratio in the form 1\u2236''x'' or ''x''\u22361, where ''x'' is not necessarily an integer, to enable comparisons of different ratios. For example, the ratio 4\u22365 can be written as 1\u22361.25 (dividing both sides by 4) Alternatively, it can be written as 0.8\u22361 (dividing both sides by 5).\n\nWhere the context makes the meaning clear, a ratio in this form is sometimes written without the 1 and the ratio symbol (\u2236), though, mathematically, this makes it a [[divisor|factor]] or [[Multiplication|multiplier]].\n\n==Irrational ratios==\nRatios may also be established between [[commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] quantities (quantities whose ratio, as value of a fraction, amounts to an [[irrational number]]). The earliest discovered example, found by the [[Pythagoreans]], is the ratio of the length of the diagonal {{mvar|d}} to the length of a side {{mvar|s}} of a [[square]], which is the [[square root of 2]], formally <math>a:d = 1:\\sqrt{2}.</math> Another example is the ratio of a [[circle]]'s circumference to its diameter, which is called [[pi|{{pi}}]], and is not just an [[algebraic number|algebraically irrational number]], but a [[transcendental number|transcendental irrational]].\n\nAlso well known is the [[golden ratio]] of two (mostly) lengths {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, which is defined by the proportion\n: <math>a:b = (a+b):a \\quad</math> or, equivalently <math>\\quad a:b = (1+b/a):1.</math>\nTaking the ratios as fractions and <math>a:b</math> as having the value {{mvar|x}}, yields the equation\n:<math>x=1+\\tfrac 1x \\quad</math> or <math>\\quad x^2-x-1 = 0,</math>\nwhich has the positive, irrational solution <math>x=\\tfrac{a}{b}=\\tfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.</math>\nThus at least one of ''a'' and ''b'' has to be irrational for them to be in the golden ratio. An example of an occurrence of the golden ratio in math is as the limiting value of the ratio of two consecutive [[Fibonacci number]]s: even though all these ratios are ratios of two integers and hence are rational, the limit of the sequence of these rational ratios is the irrational golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the [[silver ratio]] of {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} is defined by the proportion\n:<math>a:b = (2a+b):a \\quad (= (2+b/a):1),</math> corresponding to <math>x^2-2x-1 = 0.</math> \nThis equation has the positive, irrational solution <math>x = \\tfrac{a}{b}=1+\\sqrt{2},</math>  so again at least one of the two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' in the silver ratio must be irrational.\n\n==Odds==\n{{Main|Odds}}\n''Odds'' (as in gambling) are expressed as a ratio.  For example, odds of \"7 to 3 against\" (7\u22363) mean that there are seven chances that the event will not happen to every three chances that it will happen.  The probability of success is 30%.  In every ten trials, there are expected to be three wins and seven losses.\n\n==Units==\nRatios may be [[Dimensionless quantity|unitless]], as in the case they relate quantities in units of the same [[dimensional analysis|dimension]], even if their [[units of measurement]] are initially different.\nFor example, the ratio {{nowrap|1 minute \u2236 40 seconds}} can be reduced by changing the first value to 60 seconds. Once the units are the same, they can be omitted, and the ratio can be reduced to 3\u22362.\n\nOn the other hand, there are non-dimensionless ratios, also known as [[rate (mathematics)|rates]].<ref>''\"'Velocity' can be defined as the ratio... 'Population density' is the ratio... 'Gasoline consumption' is measure as the ratio...\"'', \"Ratio and Proportion: Research and Teaching in Mathematics Teachers\"  [https://books.google.com/books?id=eawKLY71xvkC&lpg=PP1&dq=ratio&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q=perspective&f=false]</ref><ref>''\"''Ratio as a Rate''. The first type [of ratio] defined by [[Freudenthal]], above, is known as rate, and illustrates a comparison between two variables with difference units. (...)

This cannot be converted to a dimensionless ratio, as in weight/weight or volume/volume fractions.\n\n==Triangular coordinates==\n\n<!-- In this section, the ratio symbol U+2236 (\u2236) is used for ratios, colons (:) for trilinear coordinates, and commas (see File:TriangleBarycentricCoordinates.svg in Commons) for barycentric coordinates.  -->\n\nThe locations of points relative to a triangle with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' and sides ''AB'', ''BC'', and ''CA''  are often expressed in extended ratio form as ''triangular coordinates''.\n\nIn [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]], a point with coordinates ''&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;'' is the point upon which a weightless sheet of metal in the shape and size of the triangle would exactly balance if weights were put on the vertices, with the ratio of the weights at ''A'' and ''B'' being ''&alpha;'' \u2236 ''&beta;'', the ratio of the weights at ''B'' and ''C'' being ''&beta;'' \u2236 ''&gamma;'', and therefore the ratio of weights at ''A'' and ''C'' being ''&alpha;'' \u2236 ''&gamma;''.\n\nIn [[trilinear coordinates]], a point with coordinates ''x''{{hair space}}:''y''{{hair space}}:''z'' has [[perpendicular]] distances to side ''BC'' (across from vertex ''A'') and side  ''CA'' (across from vertex ''B'') in the ratio ''x''{{hair space}}\u2236''y'', distances to side ''CA'' and side ''AB'' (across from ''C'') in the ratio ''y''{{hair space}}\u2236''z'', and therefore distances to sides ''BC'' and ''AB'' in the ratio ''x''{{hair space}}\u2236''z''.\n\nSince all information is expressed in terms of ratios (the individual numbers denoted by ''&alpha;, &beta;, &gamma;, x, y,'' and ''z'' have no meaning by themselves), a triangle analysis using barycentric or trilinear coordinates applies regardless of the size of the triangle.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dilution ratio]]\n*[[Displacement\u2013length ratio]]\n*[[Dimensionless quantity]]\n*[[Financial ratio]]\n*[[Fold change]]\n*[[Interval (music)]]\n*[[Odds ratio]]\n*[[Parts-per notation]]\n*[[Price\u2013performance ratio]]\n*[[Proportionality (mathematics)]]\n*[[Ratio distribution]]\n*[[Ratio estimator]]\n*[[Rate (mathematics)]]\n*[[Rate ratio]]\n*[[Relative risk]]\n*[[Rule of three (mathematics)]]\n*[[Scale (map)]]\n*[[Sex ratio]]\n*[[Slope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 \"Ratio\" ''The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia'' vol. 19], The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London pp.&nbsp;307ff\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgAoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA270 \"Proportion\" ''New International Encyclopedia, Vol. 19'' 2nd ed.
