The two islands were originally separated by shallow sea. That area between the two islands was [[reclaimed]] for the construction project, effectively connecting the once separate Yeongjong and Yongyu islands. The reclaimed area as well as the two islands are all part of Jung-gu, an administrative district of Incheon.\n\nThe airport holds a record of being ranked the Best Airport Worldwide for 11 consecutive years by the [[Airports Council International]] (ACI)'s [[List of Airport Service Quality Award winners|Airport Service Quality Award]] from 2005 to 2016, and has also been rated the world's best among airports of its size (25\u201340 million passengers) and region (Asia-Pacific) since 2012 due to the institution's decision to discontinue the Best Airport Worldwide category. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIncheon International Airport's terminal has 111 boarding gates altogether, with 44 in Terminal 1, 30 in Concourse A (connected to terminal 1), and 37 in Terminal 2.\n\nThe airport was constructed to share the demand for air transport in the 21st century and to serve as a hub airport in Northeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1167159&cid=40942&categoryId=32188|title=\uc778\ucc9c\uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d|access-date=2018-03-28|language=ko}}</ref>\n[[File:Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 Departure.jpg|thumb|Departure hall at Terminal 1]]\n[[File:Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 Arrival.jpg|thumb|Arrival hall at Terminal 1]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yeongjong location.svg|thumb|left|Location of Incheon International Airport on reclaimed land joining [[Yeongjong]] and Yongyu Islands]]\n\n[[File:Incheon International Airport flom Airplane.JPG|250px|thumb|Incheon Airport from the air, 2003]]\n\nAfter the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], international air traffic to Korea increased. In the 1990s, it became apparent that [[Gimpo International Airport]] could not cope with the increase in air traffic. To reduce the load on Gimpo International Airport, the government decided to build a new international airport.\n\nThe new airport was originally planned to be located in [[Cheongju]], 124&nbsp;km from Seoul, but due to its distance, it was opposed by Seoul and Gyeonggi citizens. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong]] was the other choice, but it was also rejected due to similar reasons. Finally the area chosen was [[Incheon]]. {{When|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn November 1992, the construction of the Incheon airport began on reclaimed land between Yeongjong Island and Youngyu Island, and took eight years to finish, with an additional six months for testing.

In 2016, the airport served a total of 57,849,814 passengers.\n\nThe airport opened for business in early 2001 to replace the older Gimpo International Airport, which now serves mostly domestic destinations plus shuttle flights to alternate airports in [[Osaka]], [[Shanghai]], [[Taipei]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n==Construction phases==\n[[File:Incheon Airport Expansion Plan.svg|thumb|Future expansion plans for Incheon International Airport]]\nThe airport was originally planned to be built in three phases, incrementally increasing airport capacity as the demand grew. This was changed, however, to four phases after the airport was opened.\n\n===Phase 1===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nIn Phase 1, the airport had a capacity of 30 million passengers annually, and a cargo capacity of 1.7&nbsp;million metric tonnes annually. In this phase, a passenger terminal with a floor space of {{convert|496,000|m2|sqft}}, two parallel runways, a control tower, an administrative building, a transportation centre (the Integrated Transportation Centre, designed by [[Terry Farrell and Partners]] and [[Samoo Architects & Engineers]]), and integrated operations centre, three cargo terminals, international business centre, and a government office building were constructed.\n\n===Phase 2===\nPhase 2 construction began in 2002, and was originally expected to be completed in December 2008. However, in an attempt to have the airport ready for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], which took place in August 2008, the schedule was modified, and Phase 2 construction was completed on 20 June 2008. During this construction phase, a third parallel {{Convert|4000|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} runway and a 13-hectare cargo terminal area were added. A 16.5-hectare concourse connected to the main passenger building via two parallel {{Convert|870|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} underground passageways was added, with a [[Mitsubishi Crystal Mover]] shuttle train [[automated people mover|APM]] shuttling passengers between the concourse and the main terminal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/06/113_24956.html|title=Incheon Airport to Open New Concourse|publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany long-distance foreign carriers were moved to the new concourse, with Korean Air and Asiana Airlines continuing to use the existing terminal.\n\n===Phase 3===\nThe [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] invested [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]4 trillion until 2017 to expand Incheon International Airport. The second passenger terminal was constructed in the northern field of the airport, and its existing cargo terminal and other infrastructures were expanded. The terminals are connected to each other by the underground \"Starline\" train. Also, a Landside Connecting system (Bus shuttle) is used for airport employees and departing passengers who don't come to the right terminal. After completion, Incheon International Airport is able to handle 62 million passengers and 5.8 million tons of cargo a year, up from the previous capacity of 44 million passengers and 4.5 million tons. Construction began in 2011 and was completed in 2017. The terminal opened on January 18, 2018. Incheon's expansion also include adding more aprons to park planes and extending a railway line to the city center of Seoul about {{convert|70|km}} away from the airport. The airport also signed an agreement to build a resort called \"Inspire\" which includes 6-star hotels, theme parks, and a casino.<ref>{{cite news|title=Incheon Airport to Have New Terminal by 2017|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/06/117_47651.html|newspaper=[[Korea Herald]]|date=29 June 2009|accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Phase 4===\nEstimated to be completed in 2020, this is the final and the ultimate construction stage. Upon completion, the airport will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and five parallel runways (one exclusively for cargo flights).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aci-na.org/sites/default/files/park_global_airport_develt_incheon.pdf|title=Incheon Airport - Airport City|last=Park|first=Sungsoon|date=September 2016|website=Airports Council International - North America (ACI-NA)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006183202/http://aci-na.org/sites/default/files/park_global_airport_develt_incheon.pdf|archive-date=6 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It will be able to handle 100&nbsp;million passengers and 7&nbsp;million metric tonnes of cargo annually, with further possible expansions. The airport is projected to be transformed into one of the ten busiest airports in the world by 2020.\n\n==Terminals==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2013}}\n[[File:RKSI Layout.svg|thumb|Airport layout (Before the opening of Terminal 2)]]\n\n===Terminal 1===\nTerminal 1 (measuring 496,000 square meters) is the largest [[airport terminal]] in area in South Korea. Terminal 1 was designed by [[Curtis W. Fentress]], FAIA, RIBA of [[Fentress Architects]]. It is {{convert|1060|m}} long, {{convert|149|m}} wide, and {{convert|33|m}} high. Its construction cost was 1.3816&nbsp;trillion South Korean Won.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} The terminal has 44 boarding ports (all of which can accommodate the Airbus A380), 50 customs inspection ports, 2 biological quarantine counters, 6 stationary and 14 portable passenger quarantine counters, 120 arrival passport inspection counters, 8 arrival security ports, 28 departure security ports, 252 check in counters, and 120 departure passport inspection counters. In 2015, an automatic check-in counter lane was introduced, where people traveling via [[Korean Air]], [[Asiana Airlines]] and [[China Southern Airlines]] can use. Instead of having airport staff at the counter, there is a machine where travelers input their flight information, scan their passports, receive their flight tickets and lastly, load the luggage onto the conveyor. This system was planned to be introduced in Terminal 2, but in May 2015 Incheon Airport used one of the counter islands for the unmanned luggage handling system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.futuretravelexperience.com/2015/05/incheon-airport-launches-new-self-service-bag-drop-system/|title=Incheon Airport launches new self-service bag drop system|author=Future Travel Experience|work=Future Travel Experience|accessdate=7 May 2016|date=2015-05-21}}</ref>\n\n===Concourse===\n[[File:Korea-Incheon-International-Airport-New-Satellite-buildingA-under-construction.JPG|thumb|Concourse building under construction]]\nThe passenger concourse was completed at the end of May 2008.

The two islands were originally separated by shallow sea. That area between the two islands was [[reclaimed]] for the construction project, effectively connecting the once separate Yeongjong and Yongyu islands. The reclaimed area as well as the two islands are all part of Jung-gu, an administrative district of Incheon.\n\nThe airport holds a record of being ranked the Best Airport Worldwide for 11 consecutive years by the [[Airports Council International]] (ACI)'s [[List of Airport Service Quality Award winners|Airport Service Quality Award]] from 2005 to 2016, and has also been rated the world's best among airports of its size (25\u201340 million passengers) and region (Asia-Pacific) since 2012 due to the institution's decision to discontinue the Best Airport Worldwide category. {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIncheon International Airport's terminal has 111 boarding gates altogether, with 44 in Terminal 1, 30 in Concourse A (connected to terminal 1), and 37 in Terminal 2.\n\nThe airport was constructed to share the demand for air transport in the 21st century and to serve as a hub airport in Northeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1167159&cid=40942&categoryId=32188|title=\uc778\ucc9c\uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d|access-date=2018-03-28|language=ko}}</ref>\n[[File:Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 Depature.jpg|thumb|Departure hall at Terminal 1]]\n[[File:Incheon International Airport Terminal 1 Arrival.jpg|thumb|Arrival hall at Terminal 1]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yeongjong location.svg|thumb|left|Location of Incheon International Airport on reclaimed land joining [[Yeongjong]] and Yongyu Islands]]\n\n[[File:Incheon International Airport flom Airplane.JPG|250px|thumb|Incheon Airport from the air, 2003]]\n\nAfter the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], international air traffic to Korea increased. In the 1990s, it became apparent that [[Gimpo International Airport]] could not cope with the increase in air traffic. To reduce the load on Gimpo International Airport, the government decided to build a new international airport.\n\nThe new airport was originally planned to be located in [[Cheongju]], 124&nbsp;km from Seoul, but due to its distance, it was opposed by Seoul and Gyeonggi citizens. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Hwaseong, Gyeonggi|Hwaseong]] was the other choice, but it was also rejected due to similar reasons. Finally the area chosen was [[Incheon]]. {{When|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn November 1992, the construction of the Incheon airport began on reclaimed land between Yeongjong Island and Youngyu Island, and took eight years to finish, with an additional six months for testing. Completion was initially scheduled for 1997 but delayed due to the economic crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airport.kr/co_cnt/en/intro/mileston/histor/histor.do|title=Incheon}}</ref> The airport was officially opened on 21 March 2001.\n\nOn 15 November 2006, the [[Airbus A380]] landed at the airport as part of the first leg of its certification trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/10/19/a380.timeline/|title=The long journey to delivery}}</ref> Tests on the runways, taxiways, and ramps showed that the airport could handle the aircraft.\n\nTo further upgrade service, Incheon and major Korean logistics firm [[Hanjin|Hanjin Corporation]] (parent company of [[Korean Air]]) agreed on January 10, 2008 to build Yeongjong Medical Centre, which was completed in 2012.

The airport serves as a hub for international civilian air transportation and cargo traffic in East Asia. In 2016, the Incheon International Airport was the [[World's busiest airports by cargo traffic|fifth busiest airport]] in the world and [[List of busiest airports by cargo traffic|third in Asia]] by cargo traffic, and [[World's busiest airports by international passenger traffic|19th]] in the world and [[List of busiest airports by cargo traffic|eighth in Asia]] by passenger traffic. In 2016, the airport served a total of 57,849,814 passengers.\n\nThe airport opened for business in early 2001 to replace the older Gimpo International Airport, which now serves mostly domestic destinations plus shuttle flights to alternate airports in [[Osaka]], [[Shanghai]], [[Taipei]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\n==Construction phases==\n[[File:Incheon Airport Expansion Plan.svg|thumb|Future expansion plans for Incheon International Airport]]\nThe airport was originally planned to be built in three phases, incrementally increasing airport capacity as the demand grew. This was changed, however, to four phases after the airport was opened.\n\n===Phase 1===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nIn Phase 1, the airport had a capacity of 30 million passengers annually, and a cargo capacity of 1.7&nbsp;million metric tonnes annually. In this phase, a passenger terminal with a floor space of {{convert|496,000|m2|sqft}}, two parallel runways, a control tower, an administrative building, a transportation centre (the Integrated Transportation Centre, designed by [[Terry Farrell and Partners]] and [[Samoo Architects & Engineers]]), and integrated operations centre, three cargo terminals, international business centre, and a government office building were constructed.\n\n===Phase 2===\nPhase 2 construction began in 2002, and was originally expected to be completed in December 2008. However, in an attempt to have the airport ready for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]], which took place in August 2008, the schedule was modified, and Phase 2 construction was completed on 20 June 2008. During this construction phase, a third parallel {{Convert|4000|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} runway and a 13-hectare cargo terminal area were added. A 16.5-hectare concourse connected to the main passenger building via two parallel {{Convert|870|m|ft|-long|adj=mid}} underground passageways was added, with a [[Mitsubishi Crystal Mover]] shuttle train [[automated people mover|APM]] shuttling passengers between the concourse and the main terminal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/06/113_24956.html|title=Incheon Airport to Open New Concourse|publisher=Koreatimes.co.kr|date=29 May 2008|accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nMany long-distance foreign carriers were moved to the new concourse, with Korean Air and Asiana Airlines continuing to use the existing terminal.\n\n===Phase 3===\nThe [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] invested [[South Korean won|\u20a9]]4 trillion until 2017 to expand Incheon International Airport. The second passenger terminal was constructed in the northern field of the airport, and its existing cargo terminal and other infrastructures were expanded. The terminals are connected to each other by the underground \"Starline\" train. Also, a Landside Connecting system (Bus shuttle) is used for airport employees and departing passengers who don't come to the right terminal. After completion, Incheon International Airport is able to handle 62 million passengers and 5.8 million tons of cargo a year, up from the previous capacity of 44 million passengers and 4.5 million tons. Construction began in 2011 and was completed in 2017. The terminal opened on January 18, 2018. Incheon's expansion also include adding more aprons to park planes and extending a railway line to the city center of Seoul about {{convert|70|km}} away from the airport. The airport also signed an agreement to build a resort called \"Inspire\" which includes 6-star hotels, theme parks, and a casino.<ref>{{cite news|title=Incheon Airport to Have New Terminal by 2017|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/06/117_47651.html|newspaper=[[Korea Herald]]|date=29 June 2009|accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Phase 4===\nEstimated to be completed in 2020, this is the final and the ultimate construction stage.

In 2015, an automatic check-in counter lane was introduced, where people traveling via [[Korean Air]], [[Asiana Airlines]] and [[China Southern Airlines]] can use. Instead of having airport staff at the counter, there is a machine where travelers input their flight information, scan their passports, receive their flight tickets and lastly, load the luggage onto the conveyor.

This name is fitting because the ACL crosses the posterior cruciate ligament to form an \u201cX\u201d. It is composed of strong fibrous material and assists in controlling excessive motion. This is done by limiting mobility of the joint. The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the four main [[ligament]]s of the knee, providing 85% of the restraining force to [[anterior]] tibial displacement at 30 degrees and 90 degrees of knee flexion.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmid = 3969275|year = 1985|last1 = Ellison|first1 = A.

Its proximal fibers fan out along the medial wall of the lateral [[femoral condyle]]. There are two bundles of the ACL: the anteromedial and the posterolateral, named according to where the bundles insert into the tibial plateau. The tibia plateau is a critical weight-bearing region on the [[upper extremity of tibia|upper extremity of the tibia]]. The ACL attaches in front of the [[intercondyloid eminence]] of the tibia, where it blends with the anterior horn of the [[medial meniscus]].\n\n==Purpose==\nThe purpose of the ACL is to resist the motions of anterior tibial translation and internal tibial rotation; this is important in order to have rotational stability.<ref name=\"Noyes 66\u201375\">{{Cite journal|last=Noyes|first=Frank R.|date=January 2009|title=The Function of the Human Anterior Cruciate Ligament and Analysis of Single- and Double-Bundle Graft Reconstructions|journal=Sports Health|volume=1|issue=1|pages=66\u201375|doi=10.1177/1941738108326980|issn=1941-7381|pmc=3445115|pmid=23015856}}</ref> This function prevents anterior tibial subluxation of the lateral and medial tibiofemoral joints, which is important for the pivot-shift phenomena.<ref name=\"Noyes 66\u201375\"/> The ACL has been proven to have mechanoreceptors that detect changes in direction of movement, position of the knee joint, changes in acceleration, speed, and tension.<ref name=\"bcmj.org\">{{Cite journal |last=Liu-Ambrose |first=T. |date=December 2003 |title=The anterior cruciate ligament and functional stability of the knee joint |url=https://www.bcmj.org/articles/anterior-cruciate-ligament-and-functional-stability-knee-joint |journal=British Columbia Medical Journal |language=en |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=495\u2013499 |access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> A key factor in instability after ACL injuries is having altered neuromuscular function secondary to diminished somatosensory information.<ref name=\"bcmj.org\" /> For athletes who participate in sports involving cutting, jumping, and rapid deceleration it is important for the knee to be stable in terminal extension, which is the screw-home mechanism.<ref name=\"bcmj.org\" />\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Injury===\n[[File:VKB-Riss MRT T1 PDW sag.jpg|thumb|140 px|MRI of anterior cruciate ligament tear]]\n{{main|Anterior cruciate ligament injury}}\n\nAn ACL tear is one of the most common knee injuries, with over 100,000 tears occurring annually in the US.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cimino|first=Francesca|last2=Volk|first2=Bradford Scott|last3=Setter|first3=Don|date=2010-10-15|title=Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury: Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention|url=https://www.aafp.org/afp/2010/1015/p917.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=82|issue=8|issn=0002-838X}}</ref> Most ACL tears are a result of a non-contact mechanism such as a sudden change in a direction causing the knee to rotate inward.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sports-health.com/sports-injuries/knee-injuries/acl-injury-causes-and-risk-factors|title=ACL Injury: Causes and Risk Factors|last=MD|first=Michael Khadavi, MD and Michael Fredericson|work=Sports-health|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en}}</ref> As the knee rotates inward additional strain is placed on the ACL, since the femur and tibia, which are the two bones that articulate together forming the knee joint, move in opposite directions causing the ACL to tear.

ACL injuries in children are a challenge because children have open growth plates in the bottom of the [[femur]] or thigh bone and on the top of the [[tibia]] or shin. An ACL reconstruction will typically cross the growth plates, posing a theoretical risk of injury to the growth plate, stunting leg growth or causing the leg to grow at an unusual angle.<ref name=\"howardluksmd.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.howardluksmd.com/journal/2010/7/23/anterior-cruciate-ligament-acl-tears-to-reconstruct-or-not-a.html|title=ACL Tears: To reconstruct or not, and if so, when?|accessdate=2010-07-23|publisher=howardluksmd.com}}</ref>\n\nThe second study noted in the L.A. Times piece focused on adults. It found no significant statistical difference in performance and pain outcomes for patients who receive early ACL reconstruction vs. those who receive physical therapy with an option for later surgery. This would suggest that many patients without instability, buckling or giving way after a course of rehabilitation can be managed non-operatively. However, the study points to the need for more extensive research, was limited to outcomes after two years and did not involve patients who were serious athletes.<ref name=\"Studies on ACL surgery\"/> Patients involved in sports requiring significant cutting, pivoting, twisting or rapid acceleration or deceleration may not be able to participate in these activities without ACL reconstruction.

Studies look at the length, cross-sectional area, and volume of ACLs. Researchers use cadavers, and in vivo to study these factors, and most studies confirm that women have smaller anterior cruciate ligaments. Other factors that could contribute to higher risks of ACL tears in women include patient weight and height, the size and depth of the intercondylar notch, the diameter of the ACL, the magnitude of the tibial slope, the volume of the tibial spines, the convexity of the lateral tibiofemoral articular surfaces, and the concavity of the medial tibial plateau.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Schneider |first=Antione |last2=Si-Mohamed |first2=Salim |last3=Magnussen |first3=Robert |last4=Lustig |first4=Sebastien |last5=Neyret |first5=Philippe |last6=Servien |first6=Elvire |date=October 2017 |title=Tibiofemoral joint congruence is lower in females with ACL injuries than males with ACL injuries |journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=1375\u20131383 |doi=10.1007/s00167-017-4756-7 |pmid=29052744}}</ref> While anatomical factors are most talked about, extrinsic factors, including dynamic movement patterns, might be the most important risk factor when it comes to ACL injury.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lloyd Ireland|first=Mary|date=2002|title=The female ACL: why is it more prone to injury?|url=|journal=Orthopedic Clinics of North America|volume=33|issue=2|pages=637\u2013651|doi=10.1016/S0030-5898(02)00028-7|pmid=12528906|pmc=4805849}}</ref> Environmental factors also play a big role.
