The charter sources refer to a synagogue in Esztergom as early as 1050. This is evidenced by the fact that two Jewish merchants from Regensburg, who came to the city from Russia, met their comrades in front of the synagogue. During the Reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants and craftsmen, who built a church for themselves, and then in 1858 another prayer house on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s. About thirty years later, architect \u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner, a colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the spirit of late romance, originally single-storey. There was only a gallery in it for the women. It was inaugurated in 1888 by Ign\u00e1c Weisz, rabbi of Esztergom and Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w of Szeged. Until World War II, it was used as intended by urban and surrounding Jews. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca reminds of the original purpose of the building.\n\nThe empty building, which had lost its function, was awarded in 1964 by the organization of MTESZ (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This is when the first major renovations began. The space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery and equipment. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center. Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion was operating here for a short time, which in 2008 moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe two-storey monument synagogue is 1216 square meters. On both sides of the fa\u00e7ade, there is a column-shaped, tower-like part of the building. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcaded foyer.

The next decade would see a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade.\n\n[[Hiram Stevens Maxim|Hiram S. Maxim]] had designed a self-loading [[rifle]] in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with [[machine gun]]s. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using cartridge energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in 1896. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, each of which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hogg|Walter|2004|p=225}}\n\n[[File:JOHN M.

During field trials, these ran into some problems, especially with [[stopping power]]. Other governments had made similar complaints.  Consequently, DWM produced an enlarged version of the round, the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (known in current military parlance as the 9\u00d719mm NATO), a necked-up version of the 7.65&nbsp; mm round.

(1980), ''Hallock's .45 Auto Handbook''.</ref> though this does not fit well with the earlier 1900 purchase of the DWM design over the Colt and Steyr entries.  In any case, a series of field tests from 1907 to 1911 were held to decide between the Savage and Colt designs.<ref name=\"Poyer\"/>  Both designs were improved between each testing over their initial entries, leading up to the final test before adoption.<ref name=\"Poyer\"/>\n\nAmong the areas of success for the Colt was a test at the end of 1910 attended by its designer, John Browning. Six thousand rounds were fired from a single pistol over the course of two days.  When the gun began to grow hot, it was simply immersed in water to cool it. The Colt gun passed with no reported malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37.<ref name=\"Poyer\"/>\n\n===Service history===\n[[File:Pistol_used_by_\"Squeaky\"_Fromme.JPG|thumb|right|A government-issue 'Model of 1911' pistol (serial number: 94854) manufactured in 1914]]\n[[File:M1911andM1911A1.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of government-issue M1911 (top) and M1911A1 pistols]]\n[[File:M151911.jpg|thumb|right|[[M15 pistol|M15 General Officers]] adopted by the U.S. Army in the 1970s for issue to Generals.]]\n\nFollowing its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then M1911, in the mid-1920s. The [[Director of Civilian Marksmanship]] began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the [[National Rifle Association]] in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols stamped \"N.R.A.\" below the serial number were manufactured at Springfield Armory and by Colt.<ref>Ness, Mark ''[[American Rifleman]]'' June 1983 p. 58</ref>  The M1911 was formally adopted by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1913. The .45 ACP \"Model of 1911 U.S. Army\" was utilized by both US Army Cavalry Troops and Infantry Soldiers during the United State's [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Punitive Expedition]] into Mexico against Pancho Villa in 1916.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n====World War I====\nBy the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government's [[Springfield Armory]].  However, the need to greatly expand U.S. military forces and the resultant surge in demand for the firearm in [[World War I]] saw the expansion of manufacture to other contractors besides Colt and Springfield Armory, including Remington-[[Union Metallic Cartridge Company|UMC]] and [[North American Arms]] Co. of Quebec.{{sfn|Hogg|Walter|2004|p=83}} Several other manufacturers were awarded contracts to produce the M1911, including the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Company]], the Savage Arms Company, the Caron Brothers Manufacturing of Montreal, the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs Adding Machine Co.]], [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]], and the [[Lanston Monotype Company]], but the signing of the Armistice resulted in the cancellation of the contracts before any pistols had been produced.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}\n\n====Interwar changes====\nBattlefield experience in World War I led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911.<ref>Canfield, Bruce N. ''[[American Rifleman]]'' June 2005, p. 26</ref> The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent [[hammer bite]]), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip checkering (eliminating the \"Double Diamond\" reliefs).<ref name=\"Poyer\" /> These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. Many persons unfamiliar with the design are often unable to tell the difference between the two versions at a glance. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1.<ref name=\"Poyer\" />\n\nWorking for the U.S. Ordnance Office, [[David Marshall Williams]] developed a .22 training version of the M1911 using a floating chamber to give the .22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the .45 version.<ref name=\"Poyer\" /> As the [[Colt Service Ace]], this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for .45 M1911 pistols.<ref name=\"Poyer\" />\n\n[[File:Colt 1911 01.jpg|thumb|Colt 1911 01]]\nBefore World War II, 500 M1911s were produced under license by the Norwegian arms factory ''[[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]]'', as ''Automatisk Pistol Model 1912''. Then, production moved to a modified version designated ''Pistol Model 1914'' and unofficially known as \"[[Kongsberg Colt]]\". The Pistol M/1914 is noted for its unusual extended slide stop which was specified by Norwegian ordnance authorities. 22,000 were produced between 1914 and 1940 but production continued after the German occupation of Norway in 1940 and 10,000 were produced for the German armed forces as ''Pistole 657 (n)''. {{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64-65}}\n\nBetween 1927 and 1966, 102,000 M1911 pistols were produced as ''Sistema Colt Modelo 1927'' in [[Argentina]], first by the [[Fabricaciones Militares|Direcci\u00f3n General de Fabricaciones Militares]]. A similar gun, the [[Ballester\u2013Molina]], was also designed and produced.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=65}}\n\nThe M1911 and M1911A1 pistols were also ordered from Colt or produced domestically in modified form by several other nations, including Brazil (M1937 contract pistol), Mexico (M1911 Mexican contract pistol and the [[Obreg\u00f3n pistol]]), and Spain (private manufacturers [[Star Bonifacio Echeverria|Star]] and [[Llama firearms|Llama]]).\n\n====World War II====\n[[World War II]] and the years leading up to it created a great demand. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including [[Remington Rand]] (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), [[Ithaca Gun Company]] (400,000), [[Union Switch & Signal]] (50,000), and [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] (500).  New M1911A1 pistols were given a parkerized metal finish instead of bluing, and the wood grip panels were replaced with panels made of brown plastic. The M1911A1 was a favored small arm of both US and allied military personnel during the war, in particular, the pistol was prized by some British commando units and Britain's highly covert [[Special Operations Executive]], as well as South African Commonwealth forces.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II |place=New York |publisher=Orbis Publishing Ltd. |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7607-1022-7}}</ref><ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 160</ref>{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=48}}\n\nSo many 1911A1 pistols were produced during the war that the government canceled all postwar contracts for new production, instead choosing to rebuild existing pistols with new parts, which were then refinished and tested for functioning. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s thousands of 1911s and 1911A1s were refurbished at U.S. Arsenals and Service depots. These arsenal rebuilds consisted of anything from minor inspections to major overhauls of pistols returned from service use. Pistols that were refurbished at government arsenals will usually be marked on the frame/receiver with the arsenal's initials, such as RIA (Rock Island Armory) or SA (Springfield Armory).\n\nAmong collectors today, the Singer-produced pistols in particular are highly prized, commanding high prices even in poor condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coolgunsite.com/images/1911/singer1911a1.htm |title=Singer Manufacturing Co. 1941 1911A1 |accessdate=2012-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222100813/http://www.coolgunsite.com/images/1911/singer1911a1.htm |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====General Officer's Model====\nFrom 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set was issued to some generals in the US Army. It was composed of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down leg strap, leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or \"male\") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or \"female\") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1981 a modified M1911A1 called the [[M15 pistol|RIA M15 General Officer's Model]] was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both came with a black leather belt, open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.\n\n====Post World War II usage====\nAfter World War II, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. It was used during [[Desert Storm]] in specialized U.S. Army units and [[Seabee|U.S. Navy Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees)]], and has seen service in both [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], with U.S. Army Special Forces Groups and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Companies.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite book|last=Campbell |first=Robert K. |title=The Shooter's Guide to the 1911: A Guide to the Greatest Pistol of All Time |page=99|publisher=Gun Digest Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4402-1434-9}}</ref>\n\nHowever, by the late 1970s, the M1911A1 was acknowledged to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] ran a [[Joint Service Small Arms Program]] to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the [[NATO]]-standard 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92S-1]] was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the [[Beretta M9|XM9]] trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the [[Beretta 92#Evolution|Beretta 92F]] on January 14, 1985.<ref name=\"New York Times Biddle\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/15/us/around-the-nation-italian-9-mm-chosen-to-replace-army-s-.45.html|title=AROUND THE NATION; Italian 9-mm.

The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) For its part, the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a [[.45 ACP]] pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials. This resulted in the Heckler & Koch OHWS becoming the [[Heckler & Koch Mark 23 Mod 0|MK23 Mod 0]] Offensive Handgun Weapon System (itself being heavily based on the 1911's basic field strip), beating the [[Colt OHWS]], a much-modified M1911. Dissatisfaction with the stopping power of the 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum cartridge used in the Beretta M9 has actually promoted re-adoption of pistols based on the .45 ACP cartridge such as the M1911 design, along with other pistols, among USSOCOM units in recent years, though the M9 has been predominant both within SOCOM and in the U.S. military in general.<ref name=Campbell /> Both U.S. Army Special Forces Units and SFOD-D continue to use modernized M1911s.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====MEU(SOC) pistol====\n{{main|MEU(SOC) pistol}}\n\n[[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s formerly issued M1911s to [[U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] units.<ref name=\"Marine\">{{cite book |last=Clancy |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Clancy |title=Marine: A Guided Tour of a Marine Expeditionary Unit |year=1996 |publisher=Berkeley Trade |location=Berkeley, California |pages=[https://archive.org/details/marineguidedtour00clan/page/64 64, 79\u201380] |isbn=978-0-425-15454-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/marineguidedtour00clan/page/64 }}</ref> Hand-selected Colt M1911A1 frames were gutted, deburred, and prepared for additional use by the USMC Precision Weapon Section (PWS) at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]].<ref name=\"Marine\" /> They were then assembled with after-market grip safeties, ambidextrous thumb safeties, triggers, improved high-visibility sights, accurized barrels, grips, and improved Wilson magazines.<ref name=\"SemperFi\">{{Cite journal |last=Hopkins |first=Cameron |title=Semper FI 1911 \u2013 Industry Insider |journal=American Handgunner |issue=March\u2013April, 2002 |date=March 1, 2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_200411/ai_82533214|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017004433/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BTT/is_200411/ai_82533214|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 17, 2015}}</ref> These hand-made pistols were tuned to specifications and preferences of end users.<ref name=\"SOF\">Johnston, Gary Paul.(2004)\"One Good Pistol\", ''Soldier of Fortune Magazine'', December 2004, 62\u201367</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Marines laid out a series of specifications and improvements to make Browning's design ready for 21st-century combat, many of which have been included in MEU(SOC) pistol designs, but design and supply time was limited.<ref name = \"SOF\"/>  Discovering that the Los Angeles Police Department was pleased with their special [[Kimber Manufacturing|Kimber]] M1911 pistols, a single source request was issued to Kimber for just such a pistol despite the imminent release of their [[Kimber Custom|TLE/RLII]] models.<ref name=\"swat\">Rogers, Patrick A.(2003)\"Marines New SOCOM Pistol\", ''SWAT Magazine'', December 2003, 52\u201357</ref> Kimber shortly began producing a limited number of what would be later termed the Interim Close Quarters Battle pistol ([[Kimber Custom|ICQB]]).

Replacement sights, grips, and other aftermarket accessories are the most commonly offered parts.  Since the 1950s and the rise of competitive pistol shooting, many companies have been offering the M1911 as a base model for major customization.

Manufactured 2017.]]\n\nBrowning's basic M1911 design has seen very little change throughout its production life.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.<ref name=\"Manual\" />\n\nAt this point, a link pivots the rear of the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame's vertical impact surface.  As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol through the ejection port. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again. However, if the fired round was the last round in the magazine, the slide will lock in the rearward position, which notifies the shooter to reload by ejecting the empty magazine and inserting a loaded magazine, and facilitates (by being rearwards) reloading the chamber, which is accomplished by either pulling the slide back slightly and releasing, or by pushing down on the slide stop, which releases the slide to move forward under spring pressure, strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber.<ref name=\"Manual\" />\n\nThere are no fasteners of any type in the 1911 design, excepting the grip screws. The main components of the gun are held in place by the force of the recoil spring. The pistol can be \"field stripped\" by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and subsequently removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly.\n\nThe military mandated a [[grip safety]] and a [[manual safety]].<ref name=\"Manual\" /> A grip safety, [[sear (firearm)|sear]] disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> Several companies have developed a [[safety (firearms)|firing pin block safety]]. Colt's 80 series uses a trigger operated one and several other manufacturers, including Kimber and Smith & Wesson, use a Swartz firing-pin safety, which is operated by the grip safety.<ref>U.S. Patent 2,169,084 (1939)</ref><ref name=\"Davis\">Davis and Raynor(1976), ''Safe Pistols Made Even Safer'', American Rifleman, Jan. 1976</ref> Language cautioning against pulling the trigger with the second finger was included in the initial M1911 manual,<ref>{{Google books |id=hs9BAAAAIAAJ |page=16 |title=Description of the Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, Model of 1911, with Rules for Management, Memoranda of Trajectory, and Description of Ammunition}} (published in 1917)</ref> and later manuals up to the 1940s.\n\nThe same basic design has been offered commercially and has been used by other militaries.

It was widely used in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. The pistol's formal designation as of 1940 was '''Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911''' for the original model of 1911 or '''Automatic Pistol, Caliber .45, M1911A1''' for the M1911A1, adopted in 1924.

The M1911 was replaced by the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum|9&nbsp;mm]] [[Beretta M9]] pistol as the standard U.S. sidearm in October 1986, but due to its popularity among users, it has not been completely phased out.  Modernized derivative variants of the M1911 are still in use by some units of the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|U.S. Army Special Forces]] and the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].\n\nDesigned by [[John Browning]], the M1911 is the best-known of his designs to use the [[Recoil operation#Short recoil operation|short recoil]] principle in its basic design. The pistol was widely copied, and this operating system rose to become the preeminent type of the 20th century and of nearly all modern centerfire pistols.  It is popular with civilian shooters in competitive events such as [[United States Practical Shooting Association|USPSA]], [[IDPA]], [[International Practical Shooting Confederation]], and [[Bullseye (shooting competition)|bullseye]] shooting.

The next decade would see a similar pace, including the adoption of several more revolvers and an intensive search for a self-loading pistol that would culminate in official adoption of the M1911 after the turn of the decade.\n\n[[Hiram Stevens Maxim|Hiram S. Maxim]] had designed a self-loading [[rifle]] in the 1880s, but was preoccupied with [[machine gun]]s. Nevertheless, the application of his principle of using cartridge energy to reload led to several self-loading pistols in 1896. The designs caught the attention of various militaries, each of which began programs to find a suitable one for their forces. In the U.S., such a program would lead to a formal test at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hogg|Walter|2004|p=225}}\n\n[[File:JOHN M.

During field trials, these ran into some problems, especially with [[stopping power]]. Other governments had made similar complaints.  Consequently, DWM produced an enlarged version of the round, the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] (known in current military parlance as the 9\u00d719mm NATO), a necked-up version of the 7.65&nbsp; mm round.

Thompson]] stated that the new pistol \"should not be of less than .45 caliber\" and would preferably be semi-automatic in operation.<ref name=\"Poyer\" /> This led to the 1906 trials of pistols from six firearms manufacturing companies (namely, [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Theodor Bergmann|Bergmann]], [[Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken]] (DWM), [[Savage Arms|Savage Arms Company]], Knoble, [[Webley & Scott|Webley]], and White-Merrill).<ref name=\"Poyer\" />\n\nOf the six designs submitted, three were eliminated early on, leaving only the [[Savage Model 1907|Savage]], Colt, and [[Luger P08 pistol|DWM]] designs chambered in the new [[.45 ACP]] (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge.<ref name=\"Poyer\"/>  These three still had issues that needed correction, but only Colt and Savage resubmitted their designs. There is some debate over the reasons for DWM's withdrawal\u2014some say they felt there was bias and that the DWM design was being used primarily as a \"[[whipping boy]]\" for the Savage and Colt pistols,<ref name=\"dmwwithdrawal\">Hallock, Kenneth R.

Six thousand rounds were fired from a single pistol over the course of two days.  When the gun began to grow hot, it was simply immersed in water to cool it. The Colt gun passed with no reported malfunctions, while the Savage designs had 37.<ref name=\"Poyer\"/>\n\n===Service history===\n[[File:Pistol_used_by_\"Squeaky\"_Fromme.JPG|thumb|right|A government-issue 'Model of 1911' pistol (serial number: 94854) manufactured in 1914]]\n[[File:M1911andM1911A1.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of government-issue M1911 (top) and M1911A1 pistols]]\n[[File:M151911.jpg|thumb|right|[[M15 pistol|M15 General Officers]] adopted by the U.S. Army in the 1970s for issue to Generals.]]\n\nFollowing its success in trials, the Colt pistol was formally adopted by the Army on March 29, 1911, when it was designated Model of 1911, later changed to Model 1911, in 1917, and then M1911, in the mid-1920s. The [[Director of Civilian Marksmanship]] began manufacture of M1911 pistols for members of the [[National Rifle Association]] in August 1912. Approximately 100 pistols stamped \"N.R.A.\" below the serial number were manufactured at Springfield Armory and by Colt.<ref>Ness, Mark ''[[American Rifleman]]'' June 1983 p. 58</ref>  The M1911 was formally adopted by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] in 1913. The .45 ACP \"Model of 1911 U.S. Army\" was utilized by both US Army Cavalry Troops and Infantry Soldiers during the United State's [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Punitive Expedition]] into Mexico against Pancho Villa in 1916.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Canfield |first=Bruce |date=October 2016 |title= 1916: Guns On The Border |magazine=American Rifleman |publisher=National Rifle Association}}</ref>\n\n====World War I====\nBy the beginning of 1917, a total of 68,533 M1911 pistols had been delivered to U.S. armed forces by Colt's Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company and the U.S. government's [[Springfield Armory]].  However, the need to greatly expand U.S. military forces and the resultant surge in demand for the firearm in [[World War I]] saw the expansion of manufacture to other contractors besides Colt and Springfield Armory, including Remington-[[Union Metallic Cartridge Company|UMC]] and [[North American Arms]] Co. of Quebec.{{sfn|Hogg|Walter|2004|p=83}} Several other manufacturers were awarded contracts to produce the M1911, including the [[NCR Corporation|National Cash Register Company]], the Savage Arms Company, the Caron Brothers Manufacturing of Montreal, the [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs Adding Machine Co.]], [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]], and the [[Lanston Monotype Company]], but the signing of the Armistice resulted in the cancellation of the contracts before any pistols had been produced.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}\n\n====Interwar changes====\nBattlefield experience in World War I led to some more small external changes, completed in 1924. The new version received a modified type classification, M1911A1, in 1926 with a stipulation that M1911A1s should have serial numbers higher than 700,000 with lower serial numbers designated M1911.<ref>Canfield, Bruce N. ''[[American Rifleman]]'' June 2005, p. 26</ref> The M1911A1 changes to the original design consisted of a shorter trigger, cutouts in the frame behind the trigger, an arched mainspring housing, a longer grip safety spur (to prevent [[hammer bite]]), a wider front sight, a shortened hammer spur, and simplified grip checkering (eliminating the \"Double Diamond\" reliefs).<ref name=\"Poyer\" /> These changes were subtle and largely intended to make the pistol easier to shoot for those with smaller hands. Many persons unfamiliar with the design are often unable to tell the difference between the two versions at a glance. No significant internal changes were made, and parts remained interchangeable between the M1911 and the M1911A1.<ref name=\"Poyer\" />\n\nWorking for the U.S. Ordnance Office, [[David Marshall Williams]] developed a .22 training version of the M1911 using a floating chamber to give the .22 long rifle rimfire recoil similar to the .45 version.<ref name=\"Poyer\" /> As the [[Colt Service Ace]], this was available both as a pistol and as a conversion kit for .45 M1911 pistols.<ref name=\"Poyer\" />\n\n[[File:Colt 1911 01.jpg|thumb|Colt 1911 01]]\nBefore World War II, 500 M1911s were produced under license by the Norwegian arms factory ''[[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk]]'', as ''Automatisk Pistol Model 1912''. Then, production moved to a modified version designated ''Pistol Model 1914'' and unofficially known as \"[[Kongsberg Colt]]\". The Pistol M/1914 is noted for its unusual extended slide stop which was specified by Norwegian ordnance authorities. 22,000 were produced between 1914 and 1940 but production continued after the German occupation of Norway in 1940 and 10,000 were produced for the German armed forces as ''Pistole 657 (n)''. {{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64-65}}\n\nBetween 1927 and 1966, 102,000 M1911 pistols were produced as ''Sistema Colt Modelo 1927'' in [[Argentina]], first by the [[Fabricaciones Militares|Direcci\u00f3n General de Fabricaciones Militares]]. A similar gun, the [[Ballester\u2013Molina]], was also designed and produced.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=65}}\n\nThe M1911 and M1911A1 pistols were also ordered from Colt or produced domestically in modified form by several other nations, including Brazil (M1937 contract pistol), Mexico (M1911 Mexican contract pistol and the [[Obreg\u00f3n pistol]]), and Spain (private manufacturers [[Star Bonifacio Echeverria|Star]] and [[Llama firearms|Llama]]).\n\n====World War II====\n[[World War II]] and the years leading up to it created a great demand. During the war, about 1.9 million units were procured by the U.S. Government for all forces, production being undertaken by several manufacturers, including [[Remington Rand]] (900,000 produced), Colt (400,000), [[Ithaca Gun Company]] (400,000), [[Union Switch & Signal]] (50,000), and [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] (500).  New M1911A1 pistols were given a parkerized metal finish instead of bluing, and the wood grip panels were replaced with panels made of brown plastic. The M1911A1 was a favored small arm of both US and allied military personnel during the war, in particular, the pistol was prized by some British commando units and Britain's highly covert [[Special Operations Executive]], as well as South African Commonwealth forces.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II |place=New York |publisher=Orbis Publishing Ltd. |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7607-1022-7}}</ref><ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 160</ref>{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=48}}\n\nSo many 1911A1 pistols were produced during the war that the government canceled all postwar contracts for new production, instead choosing to rebuild existing pistols with new parts, which were then refinished and tested for functioning. From the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s thousands of 1911s and 1911A1s were refurbished at U.S. Arsenals and Service depots. These arsenal rebuilds consisted of anything from minor inspections to major overhauls of pistols returned from service use. Pistols that were refurbished at government arsenals will usually be marked on the frame/receiver with the arsenal's initials, such as RIA (Rock Island Armory) or SA (Springfield Armory).\n\nAmong collectors today, the Singer-produced pistols in particular are highly prized, commanding high prices even in poor condition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coolgunsite.com/images/1911/singer1911a1.htm |title=Singer Manufacturing Co. 1941 1911A1 |accessdate=2012-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222100813/http://www.coolgunsite.com/images/1911/singer1911a1.htm |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====General Officer's Model====\nFrom 1943 to 1945 a fine-grade russet-leather M1916 pistol belt set was issued to some generals in the US Army. It was composed of a leather belt, leather enclosed flap-holster with braided leather tie-down leg strap, leather two-pocket magazine pouch, and a rope neck lanyard. The metal buckle and fittings were in gilded brass. The buckle had the seal of the U.S. on the center (or \"male\") piece and a laurel wreath on the circular (or \"female\") piece. The pistol was a standard-issue M1911A1 that came with a cleaning kit and three magazines.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1981 a modified M1911A1 called the [[M15 pistol|RIA M15 General Officer's Model]] was issued to General Officers in the US Army and US Air Force. From 1982 to 1986 the regular M1911A1 was issued. Both came with a black leather belt, open holster with retaining strap, and a two-pocket magazine pouch. The metal buckle and fittings were similar to the M1916 General Officer's Model except it came in gold metal for the Army and in silver metal for the Air Force. The M15 and M1911A1 were replaced with the M9 pistol in 1986.\n\n====Post World War II usage====\nAfter World War II, the M1911 continued to be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]]. It was used during [[Desert Storm]] in specialized U.S. Army units and [[Seabee|U.S. Navy Mobile Construction Battalions (Seabees)]], and has seen service in both [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], with U.S. Army Special Forces Groups and Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Companies.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite book|last=Campbell |first=Robert K. |title=The Shooter's Guide to the 1911: A Guide to the Greatest Pistol of All Time |page=99|publisher=Gun Digest Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4402-1434-9}}</ref>\n\nHowever, by the late 1970s, the M1911A1 was acknowledged to be showing its age. Under political pressure from Congress to standardize on a single modern pistol design, the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] ran a [[Joint Service Small Arms Program]] to select a new semi-automatic pistol using the [[NATO]]-standard 9&nbsp;mm Parabellum pistol cartridge. After trials, the [[Beretta 92|Beretta 92S-1]] was chosen. The Army contested this result and subsequently ran its own competition in 1981, the [[Beretta M9|XM9]] trials, eventually leading to the official adoption of the [[Beretta 92#Evolution|Beretta 92F]] on January 14, 1985.<ref name=\"New York Times Biddle\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/15/us/around-the-nation-italian-9-mm-chosen-to-replace-army-s-.45.html|title=AROUND THE NATION; Italian 9-mm.

The [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] (USMC) in particular were noted for continuing the use of M1911 pistols for selected personnel in MEU(SOC) and reconnaissance units (though the USMC also purchased over 50,000 M9 pistols.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}) For its part, the [[United States Special Operations Command]] (USSOCOM) issued a requirement for a [[.45 ACP]] pistol in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) trials.

Manufactured 2017.]]\n\nBrowning's basic M1911 design has seen very little change throughout its production life.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> The basic principle of the pistol is recoil operation.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> As the expanding combustion gases force the bullet down the barrel, they give reverse momentum to the slide and barrel which are locked together during this portion of the firing cycle. After the bullet has left the barrel, the slide and barrel continue rearward a short distance.<ref name=\"Manual\" />\n\nAt this point, a link pivots the rear of the barrel down, out of locking recesses in the slide, and the barrel is stopped by making contact with the lower barrel lugs against the frame's vertical impact surface.  As the slide continues rearward, a claw extractor pulls the spent casing from the firing chamber and an ejector strikes the rear of the case, pivoting it out and away from the pistol through the ejection port. The slide stops and is then propelled forward by a spring to strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber. At the forward end of its travel, the slide locks into the barrel and is ready to fire again. However, if the fired round was the last round in the magazine, the slide will lock in the rearward position, which notifies the shooter to reload by ejecting the empty magazine and inserting a loaded magazine, and facilitates (by being rearwards) reloading the chamber, which is accomplished by either pulling the slide back slightly and releasing, or by pushing down on the slide stop, which releases the slide to move forward under spring pressure, strip a fresh cartridge from the magazine and feed it into the firing chamber.<ref name=\"Manual\" />\n\nThere are no fasteners of any type in the 1911 design, excepting the grip screws. The main components of the gun are held in place by the force of the recoil spring. The pistol can be \"field stripped\" by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and subsequently removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly.\n\nThe military mandated a [[grip safety]] and a [[manual safety]].<ref name=\"Manual\" /> A grip safety, [[sear (firearm)|sear]] disconnect, slide stop, half cock position, and manual safety (located on the left rear of the frame) are on all standard M1911A1s.<ref name=\"Manual\" /> Several companies have developed a [[safety (firearms)|firing pin block safety]].
