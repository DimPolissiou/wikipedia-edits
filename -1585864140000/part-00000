In the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' Keith Watson summed it up as \"sleazy fun [but] not without a certain soiled charm\",<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/reviews/840092-him-her-was-sleazy-fun-with-charm |title=TV review: Him & Her (BBC3) |work=Metro |date= |accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref> while in ''[[The Independent]]'' Brian Viner compared the set-up to that of the popular British sitcom ''[[The Royle Family]]'', describing ''Him and Her'' as \"beautifully acted... wonderfully written... and intermittently very funny indeed\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-tv--jamies-american-food-revolution-channel-4-him--her-bbc3-bouquet-of-barbed-wire-itv1-2078403.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Brian | last=Viner | title=Last Night's TV \u2013 Jamie's American Food Revolution, Channel 4; Him & Her, BBC3; Bouquet of Barbed Wire, ITV1 | date=14 September 2010}}</ref> In one of the more negative reviews, David Crawford of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' was a little more reserved in his praise of the show; although he admitted that \"the chemistry between the two leads...

''You Only Live Twice'' is the first Bond film to be directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], who later directed the 1977 film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and the 1979 film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', both starring [[Roger Moore]]. The film's screenplay was written by [[Roald Dahl]], and loosely based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1964 novel of the [[You Only Live Twice (novel)|same name]]. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.\n\nIn the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit. With each nation blaming the other amidst the [[Cold War]], Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the head of [[SPECTRE]]. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially [[unseen character]]. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Black |first1= Jeremy |authorlink= Jeremy Black (historian) |year= 2005 |title= The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen |publisher= [[University of Nebraska Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8032-6240-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122 122] |url= https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice |title= ''You Only Live Twice'' |website= Britmovie.co.uk |accessdate= 15 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131200/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice/ |archive-date= 29 May 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\n''You Only Live Twice'' was a great success, receiving positive reviews and grossing over $111&nbsp;million in worldwide box office.\n\n==Plot==\nAmerican [[NASA]] [[spacecraft]] [[Project Gemini|Jupiter 16]] is hijacked from orbit by an unidentified spaceship. The United States suspects it to be the work of the [[Soviets]], but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft, after having \"swallowed\" Jupiter 16, landed in the [[Sea of Japan]]. To investigate, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] operative James Bond is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death in Hong Kong and being [[buried at sea]] from {{HMS|Tenby|F65|6}}.\n\nUpon his arrival, Bond attends a [[sumo]] match where he is approached by Japanese secret service agent [[Aki (James Bond)|Aki]] who takes him to meet local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise, and is driven in the getaway car to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of the company's president, Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to the office of the head of the Japanese secret service, [[List of James Bond allies#Tiger Tanaka|Tiger Tanaka]]. The stolen documents are examined, and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship ''Ning-Po'', with a [[microdot]] message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution. While at Tanaka's spa, Bond meets with Aki again. Having developed feelings for each other, the pair kiss and Bond carries Aki to his bed. \n\nBond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, masquerading as a potential new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting, he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed; both are revealed to be [[SPECTRE]] agents. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to [[Kobe]], where the ''Ning-Po'' is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities, and discover that the ship was delivering elements for [[rocket fuel]]. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured. He wakes, tied up in Brandt's cabin on the ''Ning-Po''. Brandt interrogates Bond, before she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him. Brandt flies Bond to Tokyo the next day, but en route, she sets off a flare in the plane, seals Bond in his seat and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to evade the trap, lands the plane and flees before it explodes.\n\nAfter finding out where the ''Ning-Po'' unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed [[autogyro]] created by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. Near a [[volcano]], Bond is attacked by four helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon turns out that the true mastermind behind this is [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the mysterious leader of SPECTRE who has been hired by a [[great power]] (strongly implied to be the [[People's Republic of China]]) to start a Soviet-American war, in order for them to destroy each other so that China can replace them as the world's new [[Superpower (geography)|superpower]]. Blofeld summons Osato and Brandt to his office to answer for not having killed Bond; Osato immediately blames his assistant, Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her to her death into a pool filled with [[piranha]]s. Blofeld then orders Osato to kill Bond.\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Himeji02.jpg|thumb|The [[Himeji Castle]], location of the ninjas' training.]]\n\nBond then meets Tanaka and Aki in Kyoto where they plan to infiltrate the island by disguising Bond as a Japanese fisherman. The following night a SPECTRE assassin tries to poison Bond while he and Aki are sleeping together, however Aki accidentally ingests the deadly liquid instead, which promptly kills her.\n\nShortly after Aki's death, Bond is introduced to Tanaka's student, [[Kissy Suzuki]], who is to act as his wife. Acting on her lead, the pair reconnoitre a cave booby-trapped with poison, and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to the secret rocket base, Bond slips in, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured American and Russian astronauts and, with their help, steals a [[space suit]] in an attempt to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft, \"Bird One\". However, Blofeld spots Bond breaking astronaut rules, and he is detained while Bird One is launched; Bond is taken into the control room where he meets Blofeld face-to-face for the first time.\n\nBird One closes in on the American space capsule, and U.S. forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, a team of Japanese ninjas trained by Tanaka approach the base's entrance, but are detected and fired upon. Bond manages to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the ensuing battle, Bond fights his way back to the control room, kills Blofeld's bodyguard Hans by flipping his body into the piranha pool, and activates Bird One's [[self-destruct]] before it reaches the American craft. The Americans promptly stand down their forces.\n\nBlofeld, who had earlier killed Osato to demonstrate the price of failure to Bond, activates the base's self-destruct system, a bomb that triggers a volcanic eruption, and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas leave before the eruption destroys the base, and are picked up by the [[Japanese Navy|Japanese Maritime Forces]] and the British Secret Service.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:007volcanocrater blofeld.jpg|alt=Large, underground missile silo with a missile pointing out the hole toward the sky next to a support structure.

Other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous.

A car chase was largely filmed in the area around the old [[Olympic Stadium, Tokyo|Olympic Stadium]]. [[Tokyo Tower]] and the centre of Tokyo can be briefly seen in a sequence where the villain's car is dropped in Tokyo Bay.

''You Only Live Twice'' is the first Bond film to be directed by [[Lewis Gilbert]], who later directed the 1977 film ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' and the 1979 film ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'', both starring [[Roger Moore]]. The film's screenplay was written by [[Roald Dahl]], and loosely based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s 1964 novel of the [[You Only Live Twice (novel)|same name]]. It is the first James Bond film to discard most of Fleming's plot, using only a few characters and locations from the book as the background for an entirely new story.\n\nIn the film, Bond is dispatched to Japan after American and Soviet manned spacecraft disappear mysteriously in orbit. With each nation blaming the other amidst the [[Cold War]], Bond travels secretly to a remote Japanese island to find the perpetrators and comes face to face with [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the head of [[SPECTRE]]. The film reveals the appearance of Blofeld, who was previously a partially [[unseen character]]. SPECTRE is working for the government of an unnamed Asian power, implied to be the People's Republic of China, to provoke war between the superpowers.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Black |first1= Jeremy |authorlink= Jeremy Black (historian) |year= 2005 |title= The Politics of James Bond: From Fleming's Novels to the Big Screen |publisher= [[University of Nebraska Press]] |isbn= 978-0-8032-6240-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122 122] |url= https://archive.org/details/politicsofjamesb0000blac/page/122 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice |title= ''You Only Live Twice'' |website= Britmovie.co.uk |accessdate= 15 February 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160529131200/http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/You-Only-Live-Twice/ |archive-date= 29 May 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the filming in Japan, it was announced that Sean Connery would retire from the role of Bond, but after a hiatus, he returned in 1971's ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' and later 1983's non-Eon Bond film ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.\n\n''You Only Live Twice'' was a great success, receiving positive reviews and grossing over $111&nbsp;million in worldwide box office.\n\n==Plot==\nAmerican [[NASA]] [[spacecraft]] [[Project Gemini|Jupiter 16]] is hijacked from orbit by an unidentified spaceship. The United States suspects it to be the work of the [[Soviets]], but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft, after having \"swallowed\" Jupiter 16, landed in the [[Sea of Japan]]. To investigate, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] operative James Bond is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death in Hong Kong and being [[buried at sea]] from {{HMS|Tenby|F65|6}}.\n\nUpon his arrival, Bond attends a [[sumo]] match where he is approached by Japanese secret service agent [[Aki (James Bond)|Aki]] who takes him to meet local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson. Henderson claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise, and is driven in the getaway car to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of the company's president, Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by Aki, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to the office of the head of the Japanese secret service, [[List of James Bond allies#Tiger Tanaka|Tiger Tanaka]]. The stolen documents are examined, and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship ''Ning-Po'', with a [[microdot]] message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution. While at Tanaka's spa, Bond meets with Aki again. Having developed feelings for each other, the pair kiss and Bond carries Aki to his bed. \n\nBond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, masquerading as a potential new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting, he orders his secretary, Helga Brandt, to have him killed; both are revealed to be [[SPECTRE]] agents. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to [[Kobe]], where the ''Ning-Po'' is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities, and discover that the ship was delivering elements for [[rocket fuel]]. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured. He wakes, tied up in Brandt's cabin on the ''Ning-Po''. Brandt interrogates Bond, before she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him. Brandt flies Bond to Tokyo the next day, but en route, she sets off a flare in the plane, seals Bond in his seat and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to evade the trap, lands the plane and flees before it explodes.\n\nAfter finding out where the ''Ning-Po'' unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed [[autogyro]] created by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]. Near a [[volcano]], Bond is attacked by four helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon turns out that the true mastermind behind this is [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], the mysterious leader of SPECTRE who has been hired by a [[great power]] (strongly implied to be the [[People's Republic of China]]) to start a Soviet-American war, in order for them to destroy each other so that China can replace them as the world's new [[Superpower (geography)|superpower]]. Blofeld summons Osato and Brandt to his office to answer for not having killed Bond; Osato immediately blames his assistant, Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her to her death into a pool filled with [[piranha]]s. Blofeld then orders Osato to kill Bond.\n\n[[File:Ch\u00e2teau de Himeji02.jpg|thumb|The [[Himeji Castle]], location of the ninjas' training.]]\n\nBond then meets Tanaka and Aki in Kyoto where they plan to infiltrate the island by disguising Bond as a Japanese fisherman. The following night a SPECTRE assassin tries to poison Bond while he and Aki are sleeping together, however Aki accidentally ingests the deadly liquid instead, which promptly kills her.\n\nShortly after Aki's death, Bond is introduced to Tanaka's student, [[Kissy Suzuki]], who is to act as his wife. Acting on her lead, the pair reconnoitre a cave booby-trapped with poison, and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to the secret rocket base, Bond slips in, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured American and Russian astronauts and, with their help, steals a [[space suit]] in an attempt to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft, \"Bird One\". However, Blofeld spots Bond breaking astronaut rules, and he is detained while Bird One is launched; Bond is taken into the control room where he meets Blofeld face-to-face for the first time.\n\nBird One closes in on the American space capsule, and U.S. forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, a team of Japanese ninjas trained by Tanaka approach the base's entrance, but are detected and fired upon. Bond manages to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the ensuing battle, Bond fights his way back to the control room, kills Blofeld's bodyguard Hans by flipping his body into the piranha pool, and activates Bird One's [[self-destruct]] before it reaches the American craft. The Americans promptly stand down their forces.\n\nBlofeld, who had earlier killed Osato to demonstrate the price of failure to Bond, activates the base's self-destruct system, a bomb that triggers a volcanic eruption, and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas leave before the eruption destroys the base, and are picked up by the [[Japanese Navy|Japanese Maritime Forces]] and the British Secret Service.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:007volcanocrater blofeld.jpg|alt=Large, underground missile silo with a missile pointing out the hole toward the sky next to a support structure.

[[Akiko Wakabayashi]] and [[Mie Hama]], both Toho stars, were eventually chosen and started taking English classes in the UK. Hama, initially cast in the role of Tanaka's assistant, had difficulty with the language, so the producers switched her role with Wakabayashi, who had been cast as Kissy, a part with less dialogue.

The [[Hotel New Otani Tokyo]] served as the outside for Osato Chemicals, and the hotel's gardens were used for scenes of the ninja training. A car chase was largely filmed in the area around the old [[Olympic Stadium, Tokyo|Olympic Stadium]]. [[Tokyo Tower]] and the centre of Tokyo can be briefly seen in a sequence where the villain's car is dropped in Tokyo Bay. Tanaka's private subway station was filmed at the [[Tokyo Metro]]'s [[Nakano-shimbashi Station]]. A sumo wrestling bout was filmed at Tokyo's sumo hall, the [[Kuramae Kokugikan]], but this is now demolished.\n* [[Port of Kobe|Kobe Docks]] appears in a sequence when Bond investigates the ship Ning Po, and is involved in a fight.\n* Bond's wedding at a Shinto Shrine was filmed in Nachi.\n* [[Himeji Castle]] in [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]] was depicted as Tanaka's ninja training camp.\n* The village of [[Bonotsucho Akime]] was where Bond and his ama wife lived and where the ama scenes were shot.\n* The ryokan Shigetomi-so (now known as Shimazu Shigetomisoh Manor) was used as the exterior of Tiger's house.\n* [[Kagoshima Prefecture]] was the location for various scenes depicting Little Nellie (see below).\n* Mount [[Shinmoedake|Shinmoe-dake]] in [[Kyushu|Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] was used for the exteriors of SPECTRE's headquarters.<ref name=\"MGM documentary\">{{cite AV media| title =Inside You Only Live Twice: An Original Documentary | medium=Television | people=Production Staff | publisher =MGM Home Entertainment Inc| year= 2000}}</ref><ref name=\"On Location With Ken Adam\">{{cite AV media|title=On Location With Ken Adam|location=You Only Live Twice: Ultimate Edition DVD (Disc 2)|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment|accessdate=31 January 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"exotic\">{{cite AV media|title=Exotic Locations|location=You Only Live Twice: Ultimate Edition DVD (Disc 2)|publisher=MGM Home Entertainment|accessdate=31 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost of the interiors were shot at Pinewood. The opening sequence in Hong Kong used some location footage of a street in Kowloon. Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour is also shown but the at-sea burial of Bond and the retrieval of the corpse was filmed off Gibraltar and the Bahamas. The scenes with the light aircraft ferrying Bond to his supposed death were shot over a very English looking, Buckinghamshire countryside whereas this was supposed to be Japan.<ref name=\"amazon.co.uk\"/>\n\nLarge crowds were present in Japan to see the shooting.
