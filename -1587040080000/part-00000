At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], Van Dam cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship. After two referees were knocked out, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] appeared from underneath the ring to attack Cena, [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spearing]] him through a table. Van Dam then hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five Star Frog Splash]] and the pinfall was counted by Paul Heyman, who suddenly ran down the aisle. On the following episode of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon]] confirmed that the title change was official due to the match being held under \"extreme rules\". For the past few weeks, Heyman had hinted that the WWE Championship would be \"rechristened\" the ECW World Heavyweight Championship when Van Dam won. On the debut of ''[[ECW on Sci Fi]]'', Van Dam was awarded the reinstated [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] by Heyman and decided to defend the WWE Championship separately and simultaneously, joking that \"this one spins\", becoming the first wrestler in history to hold both the WWE Championship and the ECW World Heavyweight Championship as well as the only one to hold them at the same time, making him a double world champion.

His return to the ring came a week later, in a losing effort to Sabu in a [[ladder match]] for number one contendership to the now renamed ECW World Championship. Van Dam slowly worked his way back into the championship picture. In October, Van Dam defeated Big Show in a non-title match to regain the number one contendership. Having the option to pick a date, Van Dam announced the title match would occur at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]. However, Heyman had the option of picking the match type and announced that the main event would be a six-man [[Elimination Chamber#Variations|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] match. At the event on December 3, Van Dam was the third participant eliminated. Later in December, Van Dam once again earned the number one contendership to the ECW World Championship, but this time by a fan poll.

{"title_page": "2010 FIA GT3 European Championship", "text_new": "{{Motorsport season\n| series = FIA GT3 European Championship\n| year = 2010\n}}\nThe '''2010 FIA GT3 European Championship season''' was the fifth season of the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]]. The season commenced on 1 May at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and ended on 10 October at [[Circuit Zolder]]. The season featured six double-header rounds, with each race lasting for a duration of 60 minutes. Most of the events were support races to the newly formed [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season|FIA GT1 World Championship]].\n\nDespite FIA's efforts to slow down the [[Callaway Cars|Callaway Competition]]-entered [[Chevrolet Corvette C6#Z06|Chevrolet Corvette]] of [[Christian Hohenadel]] and Daniel Keilwitz via extensive performance balancing, the pairing finished the season as champions, taking four victories to secure the title with a meeting to spare; the second such championship crown for a team running a Corvette after the 2008 triumph of French duo Arnaud Peyroles and James Ruffier. \n\nThe championship-winning margin for Hohenadel and Keilwitz was 46 points over the [[Prospeed Competition]] Porsche of Paul van Splunteren and [[Marco Holzer]], who took two wins over the course of the season at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve|Portim\u00e3o]] and Zolder. Another Corvette, run by Graff Racing, finished in third place with drivers Joakim Lambotte and Mike Parisy, who won both races at [[Masaryk Circuit|Brno]]. Four other duos took race victories during the season; [[Siso Cunill]] and Tim Bergmeister of Trackspeed won the season-opening race at Silverstone, Kenneth Heyer and Bernd Herdlhofer, and Csaba Walter and [[Claudia H\u00fcrtgen]] won at [[Circuito del Jarama|Jarama]] for [[Team Rosberg]] and Schubert Motorsport respectively, with the other Schubert Motorsport car of Patrick S\u00f6derlund and Edward Sandstr\u00f6m winning at Zolder.\n\n[[Prospeed Competition]] won the Teams' Championship, but were only confirmed as champions in December following a hearing to the FIA International Court of Appeal. Van Splunteren and Holzer had been disqualified from a victory at Zolder, due to a technical infringement regarding the weight of the car's rear brake discs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gt3europe.com/newsitem.php?key=617|title=Prospeed Confirmed as 2010 FIA GT3 European Team Champions by FIA International Court of Appeal|work=[[FIA GT3 European Championship]]|publisher=[[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation]]|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> \n\nUltimately, Prospeed were reinstated which allowed them to regain the teams title which Callaway Competition had assumed from the disqualification. Callaway finished second, ten points behind Prospeed, with Schubert Motorsport finishing third. In the Manufacturers' Cups, the top-two overall placings for Hohenadel and Keilwitz, and van Splunteren and Holzer helped to claim the cups for Corvette and Porsche respectively. The other cup, for Audi drivers, was won by Ireland's Se\u00e1n Paul Breslin for the German Black Falcon team.\n\n==Entries and Drivers==\nThe list below contains the confirmed teams and drivers that competed in the 2010 championship.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://gt3europe.com/newsitem.php?key=524 | title = FIA Release Official Entry List for the 2010 Championship | work = [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] | publisher = [[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation]] | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n!

The season commenced on 1 May at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] and ended on 10 October at [[Circuit Zolder]]. The season featured six double-header rounds, with each race lasting for a duration of 60 minutes. Most of the events were support races to the newly formed [[2010 FIA GT1 World Championship season|FIA GT1 World Championship]].\n\nDespite FIA's efforts to slow down the [[Callaway Cars|Callaway Competition]]-entered [[Chevrolet Corvette C6#Z06|Chevrolet Corvette]] of [[Christian Hohenadel]] and Daniel Keilwitz via extensive performance balancing, the pairing finished the season as champions, taking four victories to secure the title with a meeting to spare; the second such championship crown for a team running a Corvette after the 2008 triumph of French duo Arnaud Peyroles and James Ruffier. The championship-winning margin for Hohenadel and Keilwitz was 46 points over the [[Prospeed Competition]] Porsche of Paul van Splunteren and [[Marco Holzer]], who took two wins over the course of the season at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve|Portim\u00e3o]] and Zolder. Another Corvette, run by Graff Racing, finished in third place with drivers Joakim Lambotte and Mike Parisy, who won both races at [[Masaryk Circuit|Brno]]. Four other duos took race victories during the season; [[Siso Cunill]] and Tim Bergmeister of Trackspeed won the season-opening race at Silverstone, Kenneth Heyer and Bernd Herdlhofer, and Csaba Walter and [[Claudia H\u00fcrtgen]] won at [[Circuito del Jarama|Jarama]] for [[Team Rosberg]] and Schubert Motorsport respectively, with the other Schubert Motorsport car of Patrick S\u00f6derlund and Edward Sandstr\u00f6m winning at Zolder.\n\n[[Prospeed Competition]] won the Teams' Championship, but were only confirmed as champions in December following a hearing to the FIA International Court of Appeal. Van Splunteren and Holzer had been disqualified from a victory at Zolder, due to a technical infringement regarding the weight of the car's rear brake discs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gt3europe.com/newsitem.php?key=617|title=Prospeed Confirmed as 2010 FIA GT3 European Team Champions by FIA International Court of Appeal|work=[[FIA GT3 European Championship]]|publisher=[[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation]]|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref> Ultimately, Prospeed were reinstated which allowed them to regain the teams title which Callaway Competition had assumed from the disqualification. Callaway finished second, ten points behind Prospeed, with Schubert Motorsport finishing third. In the Manufacturers' Cups, the top-two overall placings for Hohenadel and Keilwitz, and van Splunteren and Holzer helped to claim the cups for Corvette and Porsche respectively. The other cup, for Audi drivers, was won by Ireland's Se\u00e1n Paul Breslin for the German Black Falcon team.\n\n==Entries and Drivers==\nThe list below contains the confirmed teams and drivers that competed in the 2010 championship.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://gt3europe.com/newsitem.php?key=524 | title = FIA Release Official Entry List for the 2010 Championship | work = [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] | publisher = [[St\u00e9phane Ratel Organisation]] | accessdate = 2010-04-13}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n!

He also finished second in the 2011 [[Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile]] and won both the [[Metropolitan Handicap|Metropolitan]] and [[Clark Handicap]]s in 2012.\n \t\nShackleford was placed into training with [[Dale Romans]], who raced the colt twice as a 2-year-old with one win. As a 3-year-old, he prepared for the Kentucky Derby in three races, including the [[Florida Derby]], where he finished second. He finished fourth in the [[2011 Kentucky Derby]] and then, at 13-1 odds, went on to win the [[Preakness Stakes]]. In doing so, Shackleford became the beneficiary of the largest payoff purse in Preakness history, winning not only the $600,000 winner's purse, but also $550,000 as the XpressBet Bonus winner. He was winless in his other starts that year but did finish second in both the Haskell Invitational and Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile.\n\nHe was retired in 2012 after winning the [[Metropolitan Mile]] in June and the [[Clark Handicap]] in November. He currently stands at Darby Dan Farm.\n\n== Background ==\nShackleford was bred in Kentucky by Mike Lauffer & Bill Cubbedge. He was sired by [[Forestry (horse)|Forestry]] out of the [[mare]] Oatsee, who was purchased in 2006 by Shackleford's breeders for $135,000. After giving birth to Shackleford, Oatsee was bred to [[A.P. Indy]] and sold, in [[foal]], for $1.55&nbsp;million. His pedigree traces to major sires of significance, including his [[Horse breeding|grandsire]] [[Storm Cat]] and his [[damsire]] [[Unbridled]].\n\nHe was named after [[Shackleford Banks]], a [[barrier island]] system in [[North Carolina]], home to a herd of feral [[Banker horse]]s and a place often visited by his owners.<ref name=USAToday>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/horses/triple/preakness/2011-05-21-136th-preakness-stakes_N.htm|author=Mihoces, Gary|title=Shackleford holds off Animal Kingdom to win Preakness|work=[[USA Today]]|date=May 21, 2011|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nLauffer was previously a co-owner of the filly [[Rachel Alexandra]], prior to her 2009 Preakness win.<ref name=USAToday/> Lauffer and Cubbedge put Shackleford up for sale as a [[yearling (horse)|yearling]] at the [[Keeneland Sales|Keeneland auction]], but when the bids failed to reach the reserve price of $275,000, they bought back the colt and kept him.<ref name=Bloodhorse/>\n\n==2010: two-year-old season==\nShackleford is trained by [[Dale Romans]]. The [[colt (horse)|colt's]] first race was on October 16, 2010, where he finished ninth in a {{convert|7/8|mi|m|adj=on}} $44,000 maiden special weight race at [[Keeneland Race Course]] on a synthetic surface. That race was won by eventual [[Blue Grass Stakes]] runner-up and Kentucky Derby starter Twinspired.<ref name=\"10-16-2010 maiden\" /> In November 2010, his second start, Shackleford won a $59,000 maiden special weight race at [[Churchill Downs]] on dirt at {{convert|7/8|mi|m|adj=on}}, taking the rail down the stretch and prevailing over a field of 11.<ref name=\"maiden special weight win\">{{cite web|title=Churchill Downs- November 27, 2010- Race 4|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=CD&dt=11/27/2010&ctry=USA&race=4|publisher=Equibase.com|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== 2011: three-year-old season ==\nShackleford's first start as a three-year-old was an allowance race at [[Gulfstream Park]] on February 5, 2011, at {{convert|1+1/8|mi|m|adj=on}}.  He was ridden by his soon-to-be regular [[jockey]], [[Jesus Castanon]]. In that race, he broke well and stalked the leader from second position, then put on a burst of speed and drew clear to win.<ref>[[Daily Racing Form]] Past Performances printed May 20, 2011 for The Preakness Stakes.</ref><ref name=\"allowance 2-5-11\" /> Romans next entered Shackleford in the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[Fountain of Youth Stakes]] on February 26 at [[Gulfstream Park]].  In that race, he was far back early and attempted to rally on the far turn but was hung out wide.  He faltered in the stretch and finished fifth to Soldat.<ref name=\"Fountain of Youth Stakes\" />\n\nIn April 2011,  Shackleford was entered in the [[Graded stakes race|Grade 1]]  $1,000,000 [[Florida Derby]], again at Gulfstream.  He drew post number&nbsp;5 and was listed at post time as a 60-1 longshot.  Breaking slowly, he floated wide going into the club house turn.  On that turn, he took over the lead from Arch Traveler and To Honor and Serve in a field that stretched 14&nbsp;lengths back to [[Dialed In]] at the rear.  Shackleford led down the back stretch and around the final turn, setting a {{convert|1/2|mi|m|adj=on}} fraction of 46.3 and a {{convert|3/4|mi|m|adj=on}} in 1:10.6.  At the top of the lane, he was challenged by To Honor and Serve and repelled him.  Three strides from the wire, he was caught by eventual [[Kentucky Derby]] co-favorite Dialed In and just missed the win, finishing second by a head.<ref name=num750/><ref name=\"florida derby\" />\n\nThat second-place finish earned Shackleford a purse of $200,000 and enough graded earnings to enter the [[Kentucky Derby]].  In addition, by virtue of his start in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and his top-three finish in the Florida Derby, the colt became eligible for the XpressBet Consolation Bonus $550,000, part of the ''Preakness 5.5 Million Dollar Bonus'' program, if he won the Preakness Stakes.  The bonus would pay $500,000 to the owner and $50,000 to the trainer of a Preakness winner who had finished in the top 3 of either the Florida Derby or the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and finished in one of a set of other listed races.<ref name=ORot2X5CB>{{cite web|url=http://www.xpressbet.com/pdf/xpressbet55rules.pdf|title=Official Rules of the 2011 XpressBet .55 Consolation Bonus Program|accessdate=August 7, 2011|publisher=MI Developments Inc.}}</ref>\n\n===Triple Crown races===\n[[File:Shackleford preakness winner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shackleford (left) leading Astrology in the stretch during the [[2011 Preakness Stakes]].]]\nIn the 2011 Kentucky Derby, Shackleford broke well and outran Comma To the Top for the lead passing the stands for the first time.  He continued to lead around the clubhouse turn and into the stretch. With about&nbsp;{{convert|200|yd|m|0}} to go, he was overtaken by the eventual winner, [[Animal Kingdom (horse)|Animal Kingdom]], who won by 2 3/4 lengths.  Meanwhile, Shackleford, now in second place with about&nbsp;{{convert|50|yd|m}} left to go, was caught by Nehro and Mucho Macho Man. He finished fourth by a length and a half in the field of 20.<ref name=SwP>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/horse/triplecrown2011/news/story?id=6573642|title=Shackleford wins Preakness|accessdate=May 22, 2011|date=May 21, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Kentucky derby chart\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, at the 2011 Preakness Stakes, Shackleford went off at odds of 13\u20131. He broke from the 5 gate in a capacity field of&nbsp;14.  Passing the grandstand for the first time, Flashpoint took the lead with Shackleford at his flank in a fast 22-3/5 for the first&nbsp;{{convert|1/4|mi|m|adj=on|0}}. Down the backstretch, the leaders slowed the pace, clocking&nbsp;{{convert|3/4|mi|m|adj=on}} in 1:12.01.<ref name=\"preakness chart\" /> At the top of the home stretch, Shackleford took the  lead.  Astrology challenged him until the {{convert|200|yd|m|0}} mark. Castanon then used the whip and Shackleford accelerated, holding off the strong late charge of Animal Kingdom to win by half a length.<ref name=SwP/><ref name=\"preakness chart\" /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/sport/story/2011-05-21/when-the-dirt-settled-shackleford-was-a-smidge-better-than-animal-kingdom|title=When the dirt settled, Shackleford was a smidge better than Animal Kingdom|accessdate=May 22, 2011|date=May 21, 2011|magazine=[[Sporting News]]|author=Telias, Brad}}</ref>\n\nBets on Shackleford paid $27.20, $10.20 and $6.80.<ref name=USAToday/> With that win, Shackleford became the beneficiary of the largest payoff purse in Preakness history.

As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then slowed to a leisurely :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.<ref name=\"belmont chart\" />\n\n===Triple Crown summary===\nShackleford's first- and fourth-place finishes in [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Kentucky Derby]] respectively handed the Triple Crown's consolation title to [[Animal Kingdom (horse)|Animal Kingdom]]. But Shackleford ended the trifecta of classic races with the a second-place finish in the Triple Crown Productions' [[Triple Crown Productions|Highest combined Triple Crown finish]] for the 2011 season. He was outfinished three year-old archrival Animal Kingdom by three points, 15 points to 12 points. [[Ruler on Ice]] finished third with ten points and Nehro finished fourth with six points. That finish put Shackleford squarely in contention (along with Animal Kingdom) for the \"[[Eclipse Award]]\" as the [[American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse]].\n\n===Remainder of season===\n\nOn July 31, 2011, Shackleford lost by a head in the [[Haskell Invitational]] at [[Monmouth Park]] in [[New Jersey]] to the [[Bob Baffert]]-trained colt Coil, who had a six-pound weight break advantage. In that race, Shackleford stumbled at the start, then caught up down the backstretch.

Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over the fast track to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third.

That race was won by eventual [[Blue Grass Stakes]] runner-up and Kentucky Derby starter Twinspired.<ref name=\"10-16-2010 maiden\" /> In November 2010, his second start, Shackleford won a $59,000 maiden special weight race at [[Churchill Downs]] on dirt at {{convert|7/8|mi|m|adj=on}}, taking the rail down the stretch and prevailing over a field of 11.<ref name=\"maiden special weight win\">{{cite web|title=Churchill Downs- November 27, 2010- Race 4|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/eqbPDFChartPlus.cfm?BORP=P&STYLE=EQB&DAY=D&tid=CD&dt=11/27/2010&ctry=USA&race=4|publisher=Equibase.com|accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== 2011: three-year-old season ==\nShackleford's first start as a three-year-old was an allowance race at [[Gulfstream Park]] on February 5, 2011, at {{convert|1+1/8|mi|m|adj=on}}.  He was ridden by his soon-to-be regular [[jockey]], [[Jesus Castanon]]. In that race, he broke well and stalked the leader from second position, then put on a burst of speed and drew clear to win.<ref>[[Daily Racing Form]] Past Performances printed May 20, 2011 for The Preakness Stakes.</ref><ref name=\"allowance 2-5-11\" /> Romans next entered Shackleford in the [[Graded stakes race|Grade II]] [[Fountain of Youth Stakes]] on February 26 at [[Gulfstream Park]].  In that race, he was far back early and attempted to rally on the far turn but was hung out wide.  He faltered in the stretch and finished fifth to Soldat.<ref name=\"Fountain of Youth Stakes\" />\n\nIn April 2011,  Shackleford was entered in the [[Graded stakes race|Grade 1]]  $1,000,000 [[Florida Derby]], again at Gulfstream.  He drew post number&nbsp;5 and was listed at post time as a 60-1 longshot.  Breaking slowly, he floated wide going into the club house turn.  On that turn, he took over the lead from Arch Traveler and To Honor and Serve in a field that stretched 14&nbsp;lengths back to [[Dialed In]] at the rear.  Shackleford led down the back stretch and around the final turn, setting a {{convert|1/2|mi|m|adj=on}} fraction of 46.3 and a {{convert|3/4|mi|m|adj=on}} in 1:10.6.  At the top of the lane, he was challenged by To Honor and Serve and repelled him.  Three strides from the wire, he was caught by eventual [[Kentucky Derby]] co-favorite Dialed In and just missed the win, finishing second by a head.<ref name=num750/><ref name=\"florida derby\" />\n\nThat second-place finish earned Shackleford a purse of $200,000 and enough graded earnings to enter the [[Kentucky Derby]].  In addition, by virtue of his start in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and his top-three finish in the Florida Derby, the colt became eligible for the XpressBet Consolation Bonus $550,000, part of the ''Preakness 5.5 Million Dollar Bonus'' program, if he won the Preakness Stakes.  The bonus would pay $500,000 to the owner and $50,000 to the trainer of a Preakness winner who had finished in the top 3 of either the Florida Derby or the [[Santa Anita Derby]] and finished in one of a set of other listed races.<ref name=ORot2X5CB>{{cite web|url=http://www.xpressbet.com/pdf/xpressbet55rules.pdf|title=Official Rules of the 2011 XpressBet .55 Consolation Bonus Program|accessdate=August 7, 2011|publisher=MI Developments Inc.}}</ref>\n\n===Triple Crown races===\n[[File:Shackleford preakness winner.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shackleford (left) leading Astrology in the stretch during the [[2011 Preakness Stakes]].]]\nIn the [[2011 Kentucky Derby]], Shackleford broke well and outran Comma To the Top for the lead passing the stands for the first time.

As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then slowed to a leisurely :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.<ref name=\"belmont chart\" />\n\n===Triple Crown summary===\nShackleford's first- and fourth-place finishes in [[Preakness Stakes]] and [[Kentucky Derby]] respectively handed the Triple Crown's consolation title to [[Animal Kingdom (horse)|Animal Kingdom]]. But Shackleford ended the trifecta of classic races with the a second-place finish in the Triple Crown Productions' [[Triple Crown Productions|Highest combined Triple Crown finish]] for the 2011 season. He was outfinished three year-old archrival Animal Kingdom by three points, 15 points to 12 points. [[Ruler on Ice]] finished third with ten points and Nehro finished fourth with six points. That finish put Shackleford squarely in contention (along with Animal Kingdom) for the \"[[Eclipse Award]]\" as the [[American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse]].\n\n===Remainder of season===\n\nOn July 31, 2011, Shackleford lost by a head in the [[Haskell Invitational]] at [[Monmouth Park]] in [[New Jersey]] to the [[Bob Baffert]]-trained colt Coil, who had a six-pound weight break advantage.
