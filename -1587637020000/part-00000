The young man and his father both seem particularly motivated by the [[dowry]] of the young fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut S\u00e9raphin has a rival in Albert Delpierre, a young Frenchman who is learning brewery from Ferdinand Beulemans and who is discreetly enamoured with the young woman. Albert learns S\u00e9raphin's secret that he is having an affair with a worker and that they have had a child. He promises S\u00e9raphin that he will never reveal any of it to Suzanne, but she is told by Isabelle, her maid.\n\nSuzanne breaks off the engagement with S\u00e9raphin and convinces him to return to the woman he loves and his son. This rupture leads to another between the two brewers who are both in contention for honorary presidency of the brewers society. In the final act, Suzanne and Albert strive to promote the election of Beulemans which instills him with a deep gratitude toward Albert.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Lucienne Roger, Berry et Jacque dans \"Le mariage de Mlle Beulemans\".jpg|thumb|left|Lucienne Roger, Jules Berry and Jacque at Paris' [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance]] in 1910]]\nOriginal cast members throughout the first Belgian and French runs featured:<ref name=figaro19100524/>\n\n* Lucienne Roger as Suzanne Beulemans, ''the only Beulemans daughter''\n* Jacque as Ferdinand Beulemans, ''Brussels brewer, Suzanne's father''\n* Vara as Hortense Beulemans, ''Suzanne's mother''\n* Jules Berry as Albert Delpierre, ''young Frenchman employed by Beulemans''\n* Fr\u00e9mont as Monsieur Delpierre, ''French shopkeeper, Albert's father and acquaintance of Beulemans''\n* Merin as S\u00e9raphin Meulemeester, ''Suzanne's fianc\u00e9''\n* Ambreville as Monsieur Meulemeester, ''S\u00e9raphin's father''\n* Vitry as Isabelle, ''Maid''\n* Mylo as Mostinckx, ''committee president''\n* Marmont as Verduren, ''committee secretary''\n* Daix as Baron, ''committee treasurer''\n* Duro, Delferri\u00e8re, Nobel, Lennac, Cerr\u00e9bos as ''committee members''\n* Cilly as Octavie, ''waitress''\n\nThe production crew included Frantz Fonson as [[stage director]] and [[Albert Dubosq]] as [[scenographer]].\n\n== About the play ==\nIn a message dedicated to the people of Brussels in 1960 for the 50th anniversary of ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans,'' [[Marcel Pagnol]] himself recounted the origin of his ''Trilogie Marseillaise:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Delsemme |first1=Paul |dictionary=Biographie nationale |year=1983 |title=FONSON |volume=LXIII |url=http://www.academieroyale.be/academie/documents/FichierPDFBiographieNationaleTome2101.pdf |format=PDF |pages=402\u2013420 |language=French |location=Brussels, B |publisher=[[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium|Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences, des lettres et des beaux-arts de Belgique]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Thys |first1=Marianne |year=1999 |title=Belgian cinema |language=en, fr, nl |location=Brussels , B |publisher=[[Cinematek|Royal Belgian Film Archive]] |isbn=9789055442348 |page=[https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 992] |quote=And since Marcel Pagnol declared that without Beulemans he would neither have written Marius nor produced so many masterpieces, why should we throw a spanner in the works? |url=https://archive.org/details/brugesrenaissanc0000unse/page/992 }}</ref>''\n\n{{Cquote|text=<blockquote>Around 1925, because I felt exiled in Paris I realised that I loved [[Marseille]]s and I wanted to express this love by writing a Marseilles play. My friends and my family dissuaded me from it: they told me that a play so localised, that put on show characters with such a particular accent, would certainly not be understood outside of [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], and that in Marseilles itself it would be considered an amateur work. These arguments seemed sound and I gave up on my project. But in 1926 I saw ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans''; this masterpiece was already 16 years old and its success had gone around the world.</blockquote><blockquote>That night, I realised that a local, but profoundly sincere and authentic play could sometimes have a place in the literary heritage of a country and appeal to the whole world. So I tried to do for Marseilles what Fonson and Wicheler had done for Brussels, and that's how a Belgian brewer became the father of C\u00e9sar and how the charming mademoiselle Beulemans, at 17 years old, brought Marius into the world. There is also another character who owes his life to the Brussels comedy: it is monsieur Brun who is, ironically, the illegitimate son of the Parisian Albert Delpierre. I had noticed that his accent made a pleasant contrast to that of the Beulemans family and highlighted the Brussels flavour of the play. That's why, in C\u00e9sar's Marseilles bar, I placed a man from Lyon.</blockquote>|author=Marcel Pagnol}}\n\nFrantz Fonson and Ferdinand Wicheler gave an extension to the play in the form of an [[operetta]]: ''Beulemans marie sa fille.''{{refn|group=note|''Beulemans marries his daughter''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Frank Wadleigh |year=1931 |title=Modern continental playwrights |url=https://archive.org/details/moderncontinenta0000chan |url-access=registration |entry=FONSON, FRANZ (JEAN FRAN\u00c7OIS) |location=New York (NY), USA |publisher=Harper & Brothers |oclc=574650455 |series=Plays and playwrights series |archive-date= |page=619 |quote=Beulemans Marries His Daughter, an operetta, 1913}}</ref>}} The music was composed by Arthur van Oost.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1914 |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions |journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions, Part 3 |volume=8 |series=New series |issue=13 |page=2009 |publisher=Library of Congress.

The young man and his father both seem particularly motivated by the [[dowry]] of the young fianc\u00e9e.\n\nBut S\u00e9raphin has a rival in Albert Delpierre, a young Frenchman who is learning brewery from Ferdinand Beulemans and who is discreetly enamoured with the young woman. Albert learns S\u00e9raphin's secret that he is having an affair with a worker and that they have had a child. He promises S\u00e9raphin that he will never reveal any of it to Suzanne, but she is told by Isabelle, her maid.\n\nSuzanne breaks off the engagement with S\u00e9raphin and convinces him to return to the woman he loves and his son.

My friends and my family dissuaded me from it: they told me that a play so localised, that put on show characters with such a particular accent, would certainly not be understood outside of [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], and that in Marseilles itself it would be considered an amateur work. These arguments seemed sound and I gave up on my project. But in 1926 I saw ''Le Mariage de mademoiselle Beulemans''; this masterpiece was already 16 years old and its success had gone around the world.</blockquote><blockquote>That night, I realised that a local, but profoundly sincere and authentic play could sometimes have a place in the literary heritage of a country and appeal to the whole world. So I tried to do for Marseilles what Fonson and Wicheler had done for Brussels, and that's how a Belgian brewer became the father of C\u00e9sar and how the charming mademoiselle Beulemans, at 17 years old, brought Marius into the world. There is also another character who owes his life to the Brussels comedy: it is monsieur Brun who is, ironically, the illegitimate son of the Parisian Albert Delpierre. I had noticed that his accent made a pleasant contrast to that of the Beulemans family and highlighted the Brussels flavour of the play. That's why, in C\u00e9sar's Marseilles bar, I placed a man from Lyon.</blockquote>|author=Marcel Pagnol}}\n\nFrantz Fonson and Ferdinand Wicheler gave an extension to the play in the form of an [[operetta]]: ''Beulemans marie sa fille.''{{refn|group=note|''Beulemans marries his daughter''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandler |first1=Frank Wadleigh |year=1931 |title=Modern continental playwrights |url=https://archive.org/details/moderncontinenta0000chan |url-access=registration |entry=FONSON, FRANZ (JEAN FRAN\u00c7OIS) |location=New York (NY), USA |publisher=Harper & Brothers |oclc=574650455 |series=Plays and playwrights series |archive-date= |page=619 |quote=Beulemans Marries His Daughter, an operetta, 1913}}</ref>}} The music was composed by Arthur van Oost.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1914 |title=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical compositions |journal=Catalog of Copyright Entries: Musical Compositions, Part 3 |volume=8 |series=New series |issue=13 |page=2009 |publisher=Library of Congress.

At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 183,491, making it the largest in [[Dorset|the administrative county of Dorset]]. With [[Poole]] to the west and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] in the east, Bournemouth is part of the [[South East Dorset conurbation]], which has a population of 465,000.\n\nBefore it was founded in 1810 by [[Lewis Tregonwell]], the area was a deserted [[heathland]] occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in [[Augustus Granville]]'s 1841 book, ''The Spas of England''. Bournemouth's growth accelerated with the arrival of the railway, and it became a town in 1870. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Hampshire]], it joined Dorset with the [[Local Government Act 1972|reorganisation of local government in 1974]]. Through local government changes in 1997, the town began to be administered by a [[unitary authority]] independent of [[Dorset County Council]], although it remains part of that [[ceremonial county]]. Since April 2019 the unitary authority has been merged with that of [[Poole]], as well as the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole]] unitary authority.\n\nThe town centre has notable Victorian architecture and the {{convert|202|ft|m|adj=on}} spire of [[St Peter's Church, Bournemouth|St Peter's Church]], one of three [[Listed building|Grade I]] listed churches in the borough, is a local landmark. Bournemouth's location has made it a popular destination for tourists, attracting over five million visitors annually with its beaches and popular nightlife.

At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 183,491, making it the largest in [[Dorset|the administrative county of Dorset]]. With [[Poole]] to the west and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] in the east, Bournemouth is part of the [[South East Dorset conurbation]], which has a population of 465,000.\n\nBefore it was founded in 1810 by [[Lewis Tregonwell]], the area was a deserted [[heathland]] occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in [[Augustus Granville]]'s 1841 book, ''The Spas of England''. Bournemouth's growth accelerated with the arrival of the railway, and it became a town in 1870. [[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of [[Hampshire]], it joined Dorset with the [[Local Government Act 1972|reorganisation of local government in 1974]]. Through local government changes in 1997, the town began to be administered by a [[unitary authority]] independent of [[Dorset County Council]], although it remains part of that [[ceremonial county]]. Since April 2019 the unitary authority has been merged with that of [[Poole]], as well as the non-metropolitan district of [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] to create the [[Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council|Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole]] unitary authority.\n\nThe town centre has notable Victorian architecture and the {{convert|202|ft|m|adj=on}} spire of [[St Peter's Church, Bournemouth|St Peter's Church]], one of three [[Listed building|Grade I]] listed churches in the borough, is a local landmark. Bournemouth's location has made it a popular destination for tourists, attracting over five million visitors annually with its beaches and popular nightlife. The town is also a regional centre of business, home of the [[Bournemouth International Centre]] or BIC, and a financial sector that is worth more than \u00a31,000 million in [[Gross Value Added|gross value added]].\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe first mention of Bournemouth comes in the [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] cartulary of 1406, where a monk describes how a large fish (\"uni magno piscis\"), {{convert|18|ft|abbr=off}} long, was washed up at \"La Bournemothe\" in October of that year and taken to the Manor of [[Wick, Bournemouth|Wick]]; six days later, a portion of the fish was collected by a canon from [[Christchurch Priory]] and taken away as [[tithe]].<ref>A.

Granville was the author of ''The Spas of England'', which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit, he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, and the increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.<ref name=\"EE38-40\">Edwards (pp.38\u201340)</ref><ref name=\"AA10-11\">Ashley & Ashley (pp.10\u201311)</ref>\n\n[[File:Entrance to the pier, Bournemouth, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of the entrance to the pier, 1890s]]\nIn the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was replaced by [[Decimus Burton]], whose plans for Bournemouth included the construction of a garden alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville.

One of the players (the American) walks out to the table where the other (the Russian) is already sat. The American looks dazed and has a blood stain on his hand. We cut back to 7 days before where the American chess player, an unkempt middle aged man, is talking to a taxi driver who addresses him as the \u2018professor\u2019 and drops him off at his apartment. As the chess player walks in, a car pulls up outside the apartment. The film cuts to a scene in a bar where the chess player is in a card game with three others and switches off a TV news item about the upcoming chess match between Soviet champion Alexander Gavrylov and the American Konigsberg. The chess player wins the card game, takes the money and then receives his cut from the barman-this seems to a source of income for the chess player.<br>\n\nAn attractive girl in the bar (Agent Stone) approaches the chess player who she recognises as Joshua Mansky, who used to teach her, who was a former champion chess player. She offers a proposal, only for Mansky to walk out of the bar before hearing it; he is followed out of the bar by another man (Agent White) who bundles him into the back of that car that was waiting outside his apartment. His agent kidnappers take him on board a plane, drugged and he wakes up in a safe room in the US Embassy where their conversations are secure, and meets Agent Novak who leads the operation. Mansky is a [[Mathematics]] genius, who defeated Konigsberg 20 years before but with an unpredictable temperament. He has some part to play in the winning of the Cold War. <br>\n\nHe is told he will have to compete in a chess tournament against Alexander Gavrylov in the Polish capital [[Warsaw]] as Konigsberg has died. Per tournament rules, Mansky is the only eligible substitute for the prior American contender Konigsberg as Mansky was the last person to beat him; Konigsberg was found dead by Soviet poisoning. Mansky agrees to play. However his drinking problem becomes apparent when he is found unconscious in his hotel room. Amphetamine drugs help to regain his consciousness before he has to go on to the chess match stage to make his first official appearance as the replacement American player. He is unable to make the first ceremonial move on the chess board after his opponent as he sees 8900 moves at one time.\nMansky is housed in the hotel venue of the chess match [[Palace of Culture and Science]] and meets the hotel director (Alfred Slega) who also seems to like alcohol. The hotel director is told by a Soviet general major (General Krutov, Russian counter-intelligence) to 'look after' Mansky, implying he will keep the American chess player drunk.<br>\n\nThe film cuts to 4 days before the opening scene. Mansky recalls he got drunk with the hotel director in the morning and does not recall the day at all including the first chess game. Agent Stone reveals that he won the game in 32 moves only. Mansky's eccentric behaviour and alcoholism is revealed to be partly due to his sheer brilliance, with alcohol slowing his brain function enough to operate more normally. The Russian general major meets Gavrylov, and encourages him to keep playing on despite losing the first match.  He tells Alfred to deny the American delegation alcohol. However, Mansky continues to access alcohol, smuggling it from functions he attends as part of the Chess social evenings. In the second game, a hypnotist in the audience blocks Mansky's thoughts and he concedes the game. Agent White pursues the hypnotist out of the chest game theatre, but is stopped by members of the Soviet group, who threaten his family who they know a lot about, including his wife being pregnant. Among the tournament attendees is a Soviet officer who is working with the Americans, Agent White tells Agent Stone they call him Gift. He is not sure how to identify him.<br>\n\nAlfred Slega befriends Mansky, and comes to him via a secret back door into his room wardrobe that allows passage into the toilets in the lobby, where he hides some alcohol for Mansky to secretly use as needed. He shares his personal experience of Soviet influence over [[communist Poland]] with Mansky, and views the [[Warsaw Pact]] as merely a continuation of the [[Nazi occupation]]. Together, they sneak in and out of the hotel through the Warsaw sewers, and Mansky learns the topography of the city through the Hotel Director as if it were a chess board. Alfred possesses a red book that allows immunity from questioning from Soviet troops. They go to a bar where they meet many of the Director\u2019s friends, who support Mansky in the chess more than Gavrylov, and who are sympathetic to American values. <br>\n\nThe next day Agent White visits Mansky\u2019s room, which is now shown to be bugged by the Soviets. He tells Mansky that someone may approach him in Soviet uniform that he can trust, who has a scar at the back of his right hand. Before Agent White can say anymore, he dies in Mansky\u2019s arms, poisoned. Mansky calls Agent Stone, who asks Mansky why Agent White came into his room. Mansky says the room is bugged, but Agent Stone tells him the room is clean. Mansky becomes distraught, so Stone takes him to the US embassy on medical grounds, where they try to brief him on the latest in Cuba. The third game is considered a draw due to his feigned illness. The agents tell Mansky about John Gift, a code name for a high ranking Soviet officer who is a spy, who only Agent White was working with. He was going to deliver the blueprints for the warheads in Cuba, but the Soviets stung the Americans in Moscow with the assistance of a spy within the Americans; given Gift was coming to Warsaw for the tournament, the chess game is in fact a game within a game, Gift searching for an opportunity to provide critical information to the Americans regarding Soviet capabilities and intentions in [[Cuba]]. Gift knows he can trust Mansky, as clearly he cannot be a spy. Agent Stone tells Mansky he needs to get the microfilm of the blueprints from Gift, hidden within a champagne cork. To do this, Mansky has to make the next game a draw, so the Soviet delegation comes to the after-match social event.<br>\n\nGeneral Krutov explains to one of his staff that Americans call a democracy one in which they discriminate against women and Black peoples, and perpetuate social inequality between the rich and the worker, and force poorer nations to give away their riches to the USA, waging war against those who do not follow the American model by nationalising their industries. Mansky's relates to Agent Stone on their return to the hotel his prior assistance to [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and the [[Manhattan Project]], which birthed the profoundly destructive power of nuclear weapons into human hands, for which he remains regretful. <br>\n\nDuring the fourth game, Mansky looks to the audience often during the game, his thinking obviously not on the game, speculating who might be John Gift. In a break period, he goes to the lobby toilets to drink some of the hidden alcohol whereupon General Krutov\u2019s staff member enters his cubicle and hands him a cork. Agent Stone then enters the cubicle, and tells Mansky to keep the cork despite Mansky offering it to her. Then both her and the other Soviet are attacked and killed in the toilet by a man in Soviet uniform. Mansky returns to the game, which is back to the opening scene of the film. His brain, suddenly transformed by the alcohol, switches on and he proposes a draw to the judges. His opponent turns this down disdainfully, as Mansky is clearly in a bad position from the earlier passage of play. Mansky then makes a number of quick moves in the game interspersed by countermoves by an increasingly frustrated Gavrylov and when he proposes a draw again to the judges, Gavrylov agrees and he applauds Mansky, squaring the series 2-2. When Mansky asks to go back to the US embassy he is told the American delegation have to stay in the hotel quarantined; Mansky goes back to his room, and the usual social event after the match carries on without him, the rest of the Soviet delegation being present along with Gavrylov. Alfred smuggles some alcohol out of the event and brings it to Mansky\u2019s room via the secret entrance in his wardrobe. Mansky asks him for help; Alfred switches on the radio loud, clearly knowing the room is bugged. Alfred says he cannot help Mansky leave the hotel, but gives him the red book, and says to not allow the Soviets to trace it back to him in case Mansky gets caught. Mansky goes into the lobby toilets by the secret passageways, and escapes into the city to head to the US embassy. \nThe world is now 24 hours from a confrontation between the USA and the USSR. At the US embassy, in the safe room, he recounts the events to Agent Novak \u2013 and says that Gift killed Stone, who was going to kill Mansky. Gift gave him another cork, and soaked the one Mansky had gotten earlier in Stone\u2019s blood, to help him identify the bad one. He then told Mansky to remember the word Rakirovka. It still is not clear to Novak whether Stone is the spy or not, and he has four hours to give President Kennedy a decision on whether to place a blockade around Cuba or not. Mansky is not sure who to trust, as Agent White did not tell Novak about the scar on Gift\u2019s hand either. <br>\n\nNovak tells Mansky that the cork soaked in Stone\u2019s blood says the nuclear weapons are ready; the one given by Gift suggests the Soviets are bluffing. President [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] wants to communicate with Mansky by secure telegram, who wonders whether Gift is not on the American\u2019s side at all. Using a riddle, Mansky passes a message to the President, and Kennedy announces a blockade of ships to Cuba containing offensive material. Mansky tells Novak to thank Gift. <br>\n\nGeneral Krutov and the Soviets find the dead bodies in the lobby toilet, and he discovers Mansky\u2019s secret alcohol, realising that the Hotel Director Alfred must have befriended Mansky. Novak tells Mansky that Rakirovka means castling, meaning imminent danger. Krutov realises with Kennedy\u2019s announcement that the Soviets have lost this battle, and orders a search for the spy in their midst, and for the Hotel Director to be summoned to him, who he tortures, as he knows he Alfred put Mansky in the room with the secret passage, and is sympathetic to America. <br>\n\nAt the fifth and deciding game, Mansky sees Gift outside in the lobby. A man in Soviet uniform is then seen to exit the hotel via the secret passages Mansky has been using all this time, whilst Gavrylov awaits for Mansky to appear at the chess table. At the exit of the secret passages into the alley leading into the streets of Warsaw, Krutov and his team are waiting. The man in the Soviet uniform they apprehend coming out of the secret passage is actually Mansky, whilst Gift uses the red book which Alfred gave to Mansky to leave the hotel which is under quarantine by Krutov to try to find the spy. Gift is wearing Mansky\u2019s clothes. Novak rushes into the alley and stops Krutov from killing Mansky as he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Mansky cannot appear in the final game, which is forfeit, and Gavrylov wins the tournament. <br>\n\nNovak flies Mansky back to the USA. The press at the airport accuse Mansky of having humiliated the USA despite him having avoided nuclear war without their knowing. Novak says to Mansky that he is a citizen hero and will be looked after, and hands him a hip flask. Novak exits the car and Gift enters the car to join Mansky, who gives Alfred\u2019s red book to him, saying he was killed. Gift says he saw the Soviet order of attack. Mansky tells Gift that Novak wants to take care of them, but gives Gifts the hip flask, and leaves the car, not wanting Novak\u2019s protection.<br>\n\nTalks commence between the United States and the Soviet Union, which ultimately result in mutual deescalation steps such as the withdrawal of nuclear-tipped missiles from some territories. The final montage goes on to mention later nuclear arms control agreements such as the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF]] of 1987, and later US assistance with nuclear disarmament in former communist countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]] after the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. However, the epilogue notes: \"In February 2019, the United States suspended compliance with the INF treaty. The same day, [[Vladimir Putin]] announced that [[Russia]] also suspended the INF treaty and will develop new intermediate-range missiles.\"<br>\n\n\"Our moral imperative is to work with all powers for that day when the children of the world will grow up without the fear of nuclear war.\" - Ronald Reagan\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Joshua Mansky\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Agent Stone\n* [[James Bloor (actor)|James Bloor]] as Agent White\n* [[Robert Wi\u0119ckiewicz]] as [[Palace of Culture and Science]] Director\n* [[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksey Serebryakov]] as General Krutov\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Donald Novak\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as Griswald Moran\n* [[Evgeniy Sidikhin]] as Alexander Gavrylov<ref name=imdb>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6445414/|title=The Coldest Game|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref name=filmwebcast>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmweb.pl/film/Ukryta+gra-2019-803482|title=Ukryta gra|via=www.filmweb.pl}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place from February to April 2018 in [[Warsaw]].

One of the players (the American) walks out to the table where the other (the Russian) is already sat. The American looks dazed and has a blood stain on his hand. We cut back to 7 days before where the American chess player, an unkempt middle aged man, is talking to a taxi driver who addresses him as the \u2018professor\u2019 and drops him off at his apartment. As the chess player walks in, a car pulls up outside the apartment. The film cuts to a scene in a bar where the chess player is in a card game with three others and switches off a TV news item about the upcoming chess match between Soviet champion Alexander Gavrylov and the American Konigsberg. The chess player wins the card game, takes the money and then receives his cut from the barman-this seems to a source of income for the chess player.<br>\n\nAn attractive girl in the bar (Agent Stone) approaches the chess player who she recognises as Joshua Mansky, who used to teach her, who was a former champion chess player. She offers a proposal, only for Mansky to walk out of the bar before hearing it; he is followed out of the bar by another man (Agent White) who bundles him into the back of that car that was waiting outside his apartment. His agent kidnappers take him on board a plane, drugged and he wakes up in a safe room in the US Embassy where their conversations are secure, and meets Agent Novak who leads the operation. Mansky is a [[Mathematics]] genius, who defeated Konigsberg 20 years before but with an unpredictable temperament. He has some part to play in the winning of the Cold War. <br>\n\nHe is told he will have to compete in a chess tournament against Alexander Gavrylov in the Polish capital [[Warsaw]] as Konigsberg has died. Per tournament rules, Mansky is the only eligible substitute for the prior American contender Konigsberg as Mansky was the last person to beat him; Konigsberg was found dead by Soviet poisoning. Mansky agrees to play. However his drinking problem becomes apparent when he is found unconscious in his hotel room. Amphetamine drugs help to regain his consciousness before he has to go on to the chess match stage to make his first official appearance as the replacement American player. He is unable to make the first ceremonial move on the chess board after his opponent as he sees 8900 moves at one time.\nMansky is housed in the hotel venue of the chess match [[Palace of Culture and Science]] and meets the hotel director (Alfred Slega) who also seems to like alcohol. The hotel director is told by a Soviet general major (General Krutov, Russian counter-intelligence) to 'look after' Mansky, implying he will keep the American chess player drunk.<br>\n\nThe film cuts to 4 days before the opening scene. Mansky recalls he got drunk with the hotel director in the morning and does not recall the day at all including the first chess game. Agent Stone reveals that he won the game in 32 moves only. Mansky's eccentric behaviour and alcoholism is revealed to be partly due to his sheer brilliance, with alcohol slowing his brain function enough to operate more normally. The Russian general major meets Gavrylov, and encourages him to keep playing on despite losing the first match.  He tells Alfred to deny the American delegation alcohol. However, Mansky continues to access alcohol, smuggling it from functions he attends as part of the Chess social evenings. In the second game, a hypnotist in the audience blocks Mansky's thoughts and he concedes the game. Agent White pursues the hypnotist out of the chest game theatre, but is stopped by members of the Soviet group, who threaten his family who they know a lot about, including his wife being pregnant. Among the tournament attendees is a Soviet officer who is working with the Americans, Agent White tells Agent Stone they call him Gift. He is not sure how to identify him.<br>\n\nAlfred Slega befriends Mansky, and comes to him via a secret back door into his room wardrobe that allows passage into the toilets in the lobby, where he hides some alcohol for Mansky to secretly use as needed. He shares his personal experience of Soviet influence over [[communist Poland]] with Mansky, and views the [[Warsaw Pact]] as merely a continuation of the [[Nazi occupation]]. Together, they sneak in and out of the hotel through the Warsaw sewers, and Mansky learns the topography of the city through the Hotel Director as if it were a chess board. Alfred possesses a red book that allows immunity from questioning from Soviet troops. They go to a bar where they meet many of the Director\u2019s friends, who support Mansky in the chess more than Gavrylov, and who are sympathetic to American values. <br>\n\nThe next day Agent White visits Mansky\u2019s room, which is now shown to be bugged by the Soviets. He tells Mansky that someone may approach him in Soviet uniform that he can trust, who has a scar at the back of his right hand. Before Agent White can say anymore, he dies in Mansky\u2019s arms, poisoned. Mansky calls Agent Stone, who asks Mansky why Agent White came into his room. Mansky says the room is bugged, but Agent Stone tells him the room is clean. Mansky becomes distraught, so Stone takes him to the US embassy on medical grounds, where they try to brief him on the latest in Cuba. The third game is considered a draw due to his feigned illness. The agents tell Mansky about John Gift, a code name for a high ranking Soviet officer who is a spy, who only Agent White was working with. He was going to deliver the blueprints for the warheads in Cuba, but the Soviets stung the Americans in Moscow with the assistance of a spy within the Americans; given Gift was coming to Warsaw for the tournament, the chess game is in fact a game within a game, Gift searching for an opportunity to provide critical information to the Americans regarding Soviet capabilities and intentions in [[Cuba]]. Gift knows he can trust Mansky, as clearly he cannot be a spy. Agent Stone tells Mansky he needs to get the microfilm of the blueprints from Gift, hidden within a champagne cork. To do this, Mansky has to make the next game a draw, so the Soviet delegation comes to the after-match social event.<br>\n\nGeneral Krutov explains to one of his staff that Americans call a democracy one in which they discriminate against women and Black peoples, and perpetuate social inequality between the rich and the worker, and force poorer nations to give away their riches to the USA, waging war against those who do not follow the American model by nationalising their industries. Mansky's relates to Agent Stone on their return to the hotel his prior assistance to [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and the [[Manhattan Project]], which birthed the profoundly destructive power of nuclear weapons into human hands, for which he remains regretful. <br>\n\nDuring the fourth game, Mansky looks to the audience often during the game, his thinking obviously not on the game, speculating who might be John Gift. In a break period, he goes to the lobby toilets to drink some of the hidden alcohol whereupon General Krutov\u2019s staff member enters his cubicle and hands him a cork. Agent Stone then enters the cubicle, and tells Mansky to keep the cork despite Mansky offering it to her. Then both her and the other Soviet are attacked and killed in the toilet by a man in Soviet uniform. Mansky returns to the game, which is back to the opening scene of the film. His brain, suddenly transformed by the alcohol, switches on and he proposes a draw to the judges. His opponent turns this down disdainfully, as Mansky is clearly in a bad position from the earlier passage of play. Mansky then makes a number of quick moves in the game interspersed by countermoves by an increasingly frustrated Gavrylov and when he proposes a draw again to the judges, Gavrylov agrees and he applauds Mansky, squaring the series 2-2. When Mansky asks to go back to the US embassy he is told the American delegation have to stay in the hotel quarantined; Mansky goes back to his room, and the usual social event after the match carries on without him, the rest of the Soviet delegation being present along with Gavrylov. Alfred smuggles some alcohol out of the event and brings it to Mansky\u2019s room via the secret entrance in his wardrobe. Mansky asks him for help; Alfred switches on the radio loud, clearly knowing the room is bugged. Alfred says he cannot help Mansky leave the hotel, but gives him the red book, and says to not allow the Soviets to trace it back to him in case Mansky gets caught. Mansky goes into the lobby toilets by the secret passageways, and escapes into the city to head to the US embassy. \nThe world is now 24 hours from a confrontation between the USA and the USSR. At the US embassy, in the safe room, he recounts the events to Agent Novak \u2013 and says that Gift killed Stone, who was going to kill Mansky. Gift gave him another cork, and soaked the one Mansky had gotten earlier in Stone\u2019s blood, to help him identify the bad one. He then told Mansky to remember the word Rakirovka. It still is not clear to Novak whether Stone is the spy or not, and he has four hours to give President Kennedy a decision on whether to place a blockade around Cuba or not. Mansky is not sure who to trust, as Agent White did not tell Novak about the scar on Gift\u2019s hand either. <br>\n\nNovak tells Mansky that the cork soaked in Stone\u2019s blood says the nuclear weapons are ready; the one given by Gift suggests the Soviets are bluffing. President [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] wants to communicate with Mansky by secure telegram, who wonders whether Gift is not on the American\u2019s side at all. Using a riddle, Mansky passes a message to the President, and Kennedy announces a blockade of ships to Cuba containing offensive material. Mansky tells Novak to thank Gift. <br>\n\nGeneral Krutov and the Soviets find the dead bodies in the lobby toilet, and he discovers Mansky\u2019s secret alcohol, realising that the Hotel Director Alfred must have befriended Mansky. Novak tells Mansky that Rakirovka means castling, meaning imminent danger. Krutov realises with Kennedy\u2019s announcement that the Soviets have lost this battle, and orders a search for the spy in their midst, and for the Hotel Director to be summoned to him, who he tortures, as he knows he Alfred put Mansky in the room with the secret passage, and is sympathetic to America. <br>\n\nAt the fifth and deciding game, Mansky sees Gift outside in the lobby. A man in Soviet uniform is then seen to exit the hotel via the secret passages Mansky has been using all this time, whilst Gavrylov awaits for Mansky to appear at the chess table. At the exit of the secret passages into the alley leading into the streets of Warsaw, Krutov and his team are waiting. The man in the Soviet uniform they apprehend coming out of the secret passage is actually Mansky, whilst Gift uses the red book which Alfred gave to Mansky to leave the hotel which is under quarantine by Krutov to try to find the spy. Gift is wearing Mansky\u2019s clothes. Novak rushes into the alley and stops Krutov from killing Mansky as he is protected by diplomatic immunity. Mansky cannot appear in the final game, which is forfeit, and Gavrylov wins the tournament. <br>\n\nNovak flies Mansky back to the USA. The press at the airport accuse Mansky of having humiliated the USA despite him having avoided nuclear war without their knowing. Novak says to Mansky that he is a citizen hero and will be looked after, and hands him a hip flask. Novak exits the car and Gift enters the car to join Mansky, who gives Alfred\u2019s red book to him, saying he was killed. Gift says he saw the Soviet order of attack. Mansky tells Gift that Novak wants to take care of them, but gives Gifts the hip flask, and leaves the car, not wanting Novak\u2019s protection.<br>\n\nTalks commence between the United States and the Soviet Union, which ultimately result in mutual deescalation steps such as the withdrawal of nuclear-tipped missiles from some territories. The final montage goes on to mention later nuclear arms control agreements such as the [[INF]] of 1987, and later US assistance with nuclear disarmament in former communist countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]] after the [[Revolutions of 1989]]. However, the epilogue notes: \"In February 2019, the United States suspended compliance with the INF treaty. The same day, [[Vladimir Putin]] announced that [[Russia]] also suspended the INF treaty and will develop new intermediate-range missiles.\"<br>\n\n\"Our moral imperative is to work with all powers for that day when the children of the world will grow up without the fear of nuclear war.\" - Ronald Reagan\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bill Pullman]] as Joshua Mansky\n* [[Lotte Verbeek]] as Agent Stone\n* [[James Bloor (actor)|James Bloor]] as Agent White\n* [[Robert Wi\u0119ckiewicz]] as [[Palace of Culture and Science]] Director\n* [[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksey Serebryakov]] as General Krutov\n* [[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]] as Donald Novak\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as Griswald Moran\n* [[Evgeniy Sidikhin]] as Alexander Gavrylov<ref name=imdb>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6445414/|title=The Coldest Game|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref name=filmwebcast>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmweb.pl/film/Ukryta+gra-2019-803482|title=Ukryta gra|via=www.filmweb.pl}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nFilming took place from February to April 2018 in [[Warsaw]].

He was the starting defensive back for the 2000 Division 8 state football champions and was a three-time All-State selection in wrestling, winning the 152-lb division in 2002.\n\nAfter high school, Ferguson enrolled at [[Central Michigan University]] before transferring to [[Grand Valley State University]]. He also did a stint at [[Muskegon Community College]]. He did not complete his degree, but had a successful collegiate wrestling career, winning the 2006 [[National Collegiate Wrestling Association]] national wrestling championship in the 165-lb division.<ref name=GVSUwrestling/>\n\nFollowing college, Ferguson moved back to California to be closer to his extended family, working in marketing and sales during the day and picking up shifts as a bartender at night. One night, while working a bar shift, a patron talked to him about his wrestling background and invited him to work with some young [[Mixed martial arts|mixed martial artists]] on their wrestling. Shortly after this, he decided to pursue a professional mixed martial arts (MMA) career.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\n===Early career===\nFerguson began his professional MMA career fighting in small organizations around California in 2007. Notable matches in his early career include a win over kickboxing champion [[Joe Schilling]] and a loss to future WEC fighter [[Karen Darabedyan]].\n\n===The Ultimate Fighter===\nFerguson applied to compete in the UFC's reality series \"The Ultimate Fighter\" multiple times. In 2010, he was finally accepted to compete in season 13 of the series after amassing a 10-2 professional record and winning the welterweight championship in PureCombat. He competed as a welterweight on [[The Ultimate Fighter: Team Lesnar vs. Team dos Santos]].\n\nFerguson was selected as the third pick for Team Lesnar. In his first fight, Ferguson defeated [[Justin Edwards (fighter)|Justin Edwards]] by knockout in the first round. He next faced Ryan McGillivray in the quarterfinals and won by a TKO in the first round. He then faced [[Chuck O'Neil]] in the semifinals and won by TKO in the third round to advance to the final.\n\n===Ultimate Fighting Championship===\nFerguson officially made his UFC debut at [[the Ultimate Fighter 13 Finale]] against [[Ramsey Nijem]] to determine the winner of [[The Ultimate Fighter 13]]. Ferguson defeated Nijem by knockout in the first round to win a UFC contract and received the ''Knockout of the Night'' bonus.\n\nFollowing his debut, Ferguson returned to lightweight and faced [[Aaron Riley]] on September 24, 2011, at [[UFC 135]]. The fight was stopped after the first round after Riley said he had a broken jaw.
