After his father's apparent death, his mother marries [[Ryan McNeil]], whom Phillip thinks of as a father. He is upset when Ryan leaves Nina to be with [[Tricia Dennison]]; meanwhile, Ryan is caught between the woman he loves and the boy whom he thinks of as his son. Nina eventually convinces Phillip to spend time with his stepfather and Tricia in order to get to know her. Eventually, Ryan leaves Tricia to be with [[Victoria Newman]] and Nina begins a relationship with [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tomas Del Cerro|Tomas Del Cerro]]. However, Ryan remains a fixture in Phillip's life until he is killed at his wedding to Victoria in 2001. Shortly afterward, Nina and Phillip move to [[Los Angeles]].\n\n===2009\u20132011===\nIn November 2008, Nina returns to Genoa City for the funeral of [[Katherine Chancellor]], however it is really Katherine's lookalike, [[Marge Cotrooke]], who has died. She reveals that Phillip is serving in the Iraq War. In 2009, she returns again, this time for Katherine's wedding to [[Patrick Murphy (The Young and the Restless)|Patrick Murphy]]. Phillip comes home in July 2009, now going by the nickname Chance; this occurs shortly after his father is revealed to be alive. Chance struggles with accepting that his father faked his death and develops an attraction to his uncle [[Billy Abbott]]'s estranged wife, [[Chloe Mitchell]]. It is apparent to everyone that Chance has a crush on Chloe, who continues to find ways to separate from Billy, and his true love, [[Mackenzie Browning]]. Chloe then tries to fix up Chance with Mackenzie as both of them became friends and to play along, although they have no romantic attraction to one another.\n\nLater on, Chance is stabbed by a homeless man at Crimson Lights. He is rushed to Genoa City Memorial where he has emergency surgery to remove his spleen. After realizing that she might lose Chance, Chloe finally admits her true feelings for him, much to his mother's dismay. Chance's surgery is successful, and he returns home where he and Chloe continue their relationship. After the couple declare their love for one another, Chance plans a surprise trip to [[New York City]] where he proposes while stuck in traffic in a cab. Chloe says no, and the two return home to Genoa City. Chance agrees to make love and to lose his virginity to Chloe. After talking with [[Kevin Fisher (The Young and the Restless)|Kevin Fisher]], Chloe asks Chance to marry her. Later after responding to a bomb call from ADA [[Heather Stevens]], Chance happily accepts Chloe's proposal. Chance has sex with Heather and is afraid to tell Chloe of their affair. Chance told Chloe he cheated with Heather; Chloe is very hurt and angry. She later confronts and physically attacks Heather. [[Ronan Malloy]] pulls Chloe off Heather and in the hall tells her he understands her pain. Chance and Ronan, who had gone to meet Chloe at Jimmy's the day Heather was attacked, get into a nasty fight. [[Christine Blair]], Nina's longtime best friend, breaks it up, but Chance tells Ronan that it isn't over. Ronan, due to his intense hatred of Chance, makes it clear to Christine after the fight that he and Chance are not and never will be brothers despite the fact that they have the same mother.\n\nA few days later, Chance is arraigned and confesses that he is holding the heroin, much to everyone's shock, and is sent to jail as a result. In truth, he made the confession only so that he could ascertain who was dealing drugs to the inmates. Chance is accidentally shot dead by Ronan. Nina, Paul, Chloe, and Heather rush in just as he is shot. Paramedics pronounce him dead on the spot. Nina and Phillip III are driven to a country road out of town to meet with Christine and Ronan, and in the backseat of Ronan and Christine's car appeared Chance, who said that \"only those four must know that he is still alive\" as he is going into the witness protection program and that this may be the last time he ever sees his mother. After Chance enters the Witness Protection Program, Katherine finds out through Nina that he is alive. Due to Ronan suffering from a liver condition that may require a partial transplant, Chance may be forced to leave the program to help him if it is determined that he is a match for his brother, whose birth father died from the same illness.\n\nChristine, Nina, Ronan, Phillip, Katherine, Paul, and Heather also know the truth about Chance's \"death\", and later Jill finds out as well. Christine tells Ronan, Paul, and Heather at the hospital that Chance is indeed a match for Ronan's partial liver transplant. The procedure is completed, but afterwards Ronan disappears. Christine later traces Ronan and it appears that Ronan came to Genoa City only to find his family and a match for a liver donation.\n\nAfter reconnecting as a friend with Chloe and a failed romance attempt with Heather, Chance decides to return to the army, much to Nina's anger. She blames Heather for this, which leads Paul to defend Heather. Chance's decision also angers Jill and Katherine, but it appears that the deal is already finalized. On Memorial Day, Chance leaves after his going-away party at the Chancellor Estate where he defends Heather against Nina and is also greeted by his father again. He also has a warm exchange with Chloe. Chance is revealed to be secretly working with Ronan to take down [[Colin Atkinson (The Young and the Restless)|Colin Atkinson]]. He later reveals that he will be leaving Genoa City again, as he has been offered a job at the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Young and the Restless}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chancellor, Chance}}\n[[Category:The Young and the Restless characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Chance Chancellor <!-- MOST COMMON NAME. -->\n| series         = The Young and the Restless\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist|\n* [[John Driscoll (actor)|John Driscoll]] (2009\u20132011)\n* [[Donny Boaz]] (2019\u2013present)\n* (and [[#Casting|child actors]])\n}}\n| years          = {{Flatlist|\n* 1988\u20132001\n* 2009\u20132011\n* 2019\u2013present\n}} \n| first          = March 15, 1988\n| last           = \n| creator        = [[William J.

He lands a job with the Dhirubhai's Global Sanskar Group of Industries. Apoorva meets Aarti (niece of Dhirubhai) and falls in love with her. Apoorva lies to Dhirubhai and Aarti about his family.

It shows how Apoorva and other family members try to hide the truth of this fake family from Dhirubhai and his niece Aarti.\n\n''Sajan Re Jhoot Mat Bolo'' revolves around the humor that comes from situational lies and liars. It is a situational comedy that arises from a small lie that the protagonist, Apoorva, had to tell his employer Dhirubhai Jhaveri to get a job. Dhirubhai is a successful businessman who hates lies and liars and believes in family bonding and values. His belief in these values at times crosses levels of normalcy and are unbelievably rigid. Apoorva was raised in an orphanage and, to get the job in Dhirubhai's company, lies that he has a full-fledged family in India. Apoorva's description of his imaginary family makes Dhirubhai fall in love with each and every member.\n\nDhirubhai has a niece Aarti, who is young, beautiful and believes in the same values as her uncle. They both trust Apoorva blindly: He has earned this trust and respect on the basis of his hard work. Over time he has become the [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Man Friday]] for Dhirubhai as well as Aarti. Apoorva has also developed a liking for Aarti but has refrained from expressing his feelings to her.\n\nDhirubhai fixes Aarti's marriage but, in a dramatic turn of events, it is called off at the last moment. Dhirubhai decides to marry Aarti with Apoorva. He announces that the marriage will take place in India, in the presence of Apoorva's family. Apoorva tries to convey the truth to Aarti but realizes that it will break her heart. He asks his best friend Raju to set up his fake family in India before the marriage, which has to take place in a few days.\n\nRaju does the needful and when Apoorva arrives in India with Dhirubhai and Aarti, he comes face to face with family for the first time. From here starts a non-stop comical journey in which the family members, who are from varied backgrounds, try to find their feet in their new characters and live up to Dhirubhai and Aarti's expectations.

A smaller alternative was later introduced at ''Toyopet Store'' locations, based on the [[Toyota ToyoAce]] called the [[Toyota HiAce]] which had the ability to carry up to 10 passengers but complied with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement.\n\nIn August 1997, Toyota \"Coaster Hybrid EV\" [[minibus]] was launched, ahead of the [[Toyota Prius|Prius]].

It is the almost the only used mini bus in public transportation in Jordan and the brand is used to refer to that segment by people and even by the government.

It is available with the same engine choices as the outgoing model. The Coaster was the first vehicle to undergo a full redesign under Toyota's newly incorporated Commercial Vehicle (CV) company responsible for the design and development of commercial vehicles. The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model. The door step were also lengthened by {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for easier entry and exit. The body was designed in a square shape for a more spacious seating space. The windshield was widened for increased outward visibility.

It is available with the same engine choices as the outgoing model. The Coaster was the first vehicle to undergo a full redesign under Toyota's newly incorporated Commercial Vehicle (CV) company responsible for the design and development of commercial vehicles. The fourth generation Coaster incorporates many safety features as standard including air-bags for the driver and front passenger, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), a ringed frame body for increased roll-over protection, pre-tensioners for the seat belts and force limiters which reduce the pressure on the passenger's chest in the event of a collision.\n\nThe height was increased by {{convert|60|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, the width was increased by {{convert|40|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and the window height was increased by {{convert|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} over the outgoing model. The door step were also lengthened by {{convert|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} for easier entry and exit. The body was designed in a square shape for a more spacious seating space.

Beth is the stepdaughter of the late Bradley Raines and daughter of Lillian Raines. She is the mother of [[Lizzie Spaulding|Lizzie]], [[James Spaulding (GL)|James]], and [[Peyton Spaulding]] and is known for her tumultuous relationship with her husband [[Phillip Spaulding]].\n\n==Background==\nThe character of Beth Raines has been half of two supercouples: Beth and Lujack Luvonaczek ([[Vincent Irizarry]]) and Beth and Philip Spaulding ([[Grant Aleksander]]). Beth has also been married to Philip's father, Alan Spaulding ([[Ron Raines]]) and Philip's best friend Rick Bauer ([[Michael O'Leary (actor)|Michael O'Leary]]). Beth, Philip, Rick and Mindy Lewis ([[Krista Tesreau]]) called themselves \"The Four Musketeers\" in the 1980s. Together they were four best friends with an unbreakable bond.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1983\u201386===\nFrom the start, the character of Beth Raines was a recognized fan favorite. ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' named her 1984's Most Beleaguered Heroine, called her a part of \"one of the top triangles ever to grace daytime\" and compared later storylines to General Hospital's romantic/adventure couple Luke and Laura.<ref>''Soap Opera Digest'', 1984</ref>\n\nBeth Raines first appeared on Guiding Light in the spring of 1983. Beth was acknowledged to have been born March 16, 1966. Her biological father was killed in Vietnam. Her mother, Lillian, a nurse, had remarried Bradley Raines. In 1983, a 17-year-old Beth was admitted to Cedars Hospital as an unconscious victim of an abusive stepfather. Her roommate was [[Mindy Lewis]]. Mindy was friends with two orderlies, [[Phillip Spaulding]] and Rick Bauer. The four of them formed a fast friendship, nicknamed \"The Four Musketeers\" which quickly developed into a romantic quadrangle. Beth was a shy, artistic teenager. Philip and Mindy, both heirs to two of Springfield's premier families, were dating when Philip fell for Beth who was dating Rick. Fate seemed to be pushing Philip and Beth together when they were named king and queen at their high school prom.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345339312|title=Guiding Light: A 50th Anniversary Celebration|first=search|last=results|date=12 December 1986|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Amazon}}</ref> When a traumatized Beth became nearly catatonic after being raped by her stepfather, the two of them ran away to New York City.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref> The storyline took place at Christmas time and introduced the character of Nick, a Santa-like figure who would make later appearances on the show throughout the years around the holiday season. The location shoot was plagued by bad weather and a need for many reshoots. However, the result was a charming memorable love story that [[Grant Aleksander]] (Philip) said was worth the extra effort. They returned to be married, but discovered that Mindy, Beth's maid of honor, was pregnant with Philip's child, and Philip married Mindy instead.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\"/>\n\nBeth moved on with a gangleader named Brandon Luvoneczek, who called himself Lujack .<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Lujack eventually learned that [[Alexandra Spaulding]] was his mother. Beth was temporarily blinded in an explosion, when a jealous Philip hired someone to blow up a bar that Lujack was building with one of his past theft victims, Floyd Parker (Tom Nielsen).<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\"/> Lujack was accused of the murder of Andy Ferris (whom Philip had paid to blow up Lujack's bar). Lujack was eventually cleared and pursued his music career, but was killed in an explosion on a ship, leaving a heartbroken Beth to eventually reunite with Philip briefly before being kidnapped and presumed dead in 1986.<ref>https://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/lujack.php</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131991===\nIn 1989, paintings of Beth surface and Philip becomes convinced that she is still alive. Meanwhile, Beth has returned to Springfield with Neil Everest, but with amnesia and unable to speak. A run-in with Bradley leads to her recovering her memory and eventually making amends with her stepfather. That December, Philip and Beth are reunited at the Willow Hills Sanitarium, where Philip stops Beth's marriage to Neil and Beth regains her speech.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-page-2-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline Page 2|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref> In 1990, Neil helps Beth recall what really happened when she was believed to be dead. She reveals that she killed her abductor, Professor Blackburn, when he tried to attack her. She sleeps with Philip who is at this time married to Blake, who refuses to grant him a divorce. When she finds out she's pregnant, she's unsure of the baby's paternity. She thinks it is Neil but later finds out that it's Philip. Neil is killed in an explosion that Philip is accused of causing.  Philip, with the help of Rick and Beth, fakes his death to escape jail time. Beth and Rick marry to throw off suspicion related to Philip's fake death. Philip returns in October, and Beth gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Spualding (Lizzie), in November. In December, Beth and Rick divorce. Rick becomes Lizzie's godfather. The following year (1991) Philip and Beth marry and moved to Arizona with Lizzie.\n\n===1997-2001===\nIn 1996, Philip and Beth were divorced off-screen.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Beth returns to Springfield with Lizzie (played by [[Hayden Panettiere]]). Philip is dating [[Harley Cooper]]. Beth begins to date Ben Warren and announces to Philip that she intends to stay in town. In 1998, she teams up with [[Annie Dutton]] to try to win Philip back from Harley. She is named as a suspect in the murder of Carl Stevens. It is later revealed that young Lizzie shot and killed Carl because he had abused her mother. She protects Lizzie and unhappily allows her to be in Philip and Harley's wedding. In 1998, Beth makes a play for Matt Reardon, but later dates Jim Lemay (legally father to Harley's daughter Susan, who she gave up for adoption as a teen mom). When Beth, Philip and Jim are in a plane crash, Jim escapes to find help. Beth and Philip, thinking they are about to die make love. After being rescued, Beth accepts Jim Lemay's proposal.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\"/> In 2000, Beth found out that she was pregnant with Philip's baby. She convinced Philip to allow her to pass the baby off as Jim's, in order to preserve both of their marriages. However, that same year, Lizzie is diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Jim refuses to allow the doctors to induce labor in order to use the stem cells from the cord blood to save Lizzie's life. After breaking up and then reconciling, Jim saves Lizzie and baby James from a fire but died shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-page-3-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline Page 3|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Beth allows herself to be seduced by Prince Edmond Winslow of San Christobel and conspires with him to overthrow his brother, Prince Richard Winslow. She became a princess but divorced Edmond when she found out that he was holding Cassie prisoner. When she found out about it Edmund kept her in the same place he had been holding Cassie. She escaped and was saved by her ex Phillip. In 2001, Beth is presumed dead again when she is caught up in a flash flood in San Christobel.\n\n===2002-2009===\nEdmund later meets a country girl named Lorelei Hills who looks exactly like Beth. He convinces her to come to Springfield and scam the Spauldings out of Beth's fortune by convincing them that Beth wasn't really dead. The con is successful and Philip began to fall in love with \"Beth.\" When he realizes that she is an impostor, Lorelei and Edmond are jailed. In jail, Lorelei has flashbacks of Beth's life and it is revealed that she really is Beth, only she that had amnesia all this time. Her fingerprints match and it is confirmed that she is the real Beth. Lorelei/Beth now struggles with her split personality. Lorelei dominates temporarily and runs off with Edmund. Eventually Beth's personality wins out and she is reunited with Philip and Lizzie. Just as they start to get back on track, a lover from Lorelei's past comes to Springfield in the unlikely person of Bill Lewis, the son of Billy Lewis and Vanessa Chamberlin Reardon, who was last seen as a teenager and is now a young college student.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2004, Philip was presumed dead, after having been shot by his father, Alan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708161250/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |archive-date=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006 Beth was shocked to learn that Rick not only helped him fake his death, but had kept that information from her and everyone in Springfield. Beth married Philip's father Alan to obtain security for herself and her children. When she miscarried their baby, he became obsessed with a Lizzie's pregnancy and trying to gain custody of the child, fathered by Jonathan Randall, son of Alan's one-time wife, [[Reva Shayne]]. Beth divorced Alan Spaulding, but despite his short-lived marriage to Doris Wolfe, and his near death at the hands of her daughter Ashley, Beth and Alan continued to bounce back and forth in their relationship. At one point, during the investigation to find out who shot Alan, Beth attempted to seduce Alan's other son, Alan-Michael, but was unsuccessful.\n\nBeth focused on protecting Lizzie and her baby from Alan and reconnected with Rick, who was at the time married to Mel Boudreaux and father to their daughter Leah. Beth, Rick and Alan formed an on-again/off-again triangle. The affair was revealed by Jonathan Randall in an angry outburst. Rick and Mel divorced and Beth became pregnant, but paternity was uncertain. A distraught Cassie tampered with the paternity test to show that Rick was the father of Beth's baby, and Beth was married to Rick on the Fourth of July by Josh Lewis, who had become a preacher. Cassie blamed Alan for the death of her daughter Tammy, and wanted ostensibly to \"protect Beth's child from having Alan Spaulding as a father.\"  Lizzie was dismayed and angry that she hadn't been invited and was one of the last people to find out. Thinking the baby was a Bauer, Beth named the baby Bernadette as a tribute to Bert Bauer, Rick's grandmother. At Bernadette's baptism, Reva blurted out the truth in order to save her own son from Alan's wrath. Beth decided instead after some additional thought to rename her daughter Peyton Alexandra Raines instead of Bernadette Bauer.\n\nBeth decided to go to law school, but her personal life remained more murky. When Alan had a brain tumor and started having visions of his dead son Gus, Beth started a relationship with Henry Cooper \"Coop\" Bradshaw who had been previously engaged to her daughter Lizzie.<ref name=\"michaelfairmansoaps.com\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/guiding-light/the-beth-chamberlin-interview-guiding-light/2009/02/07/|title=THE BETH CHAMBERLIN INTERVIEW- GUIDING LIGHT|website=michaelfairmansoaps.com}}</ref> The relationship was supposed to be kept secret so Alan wouldn't find out but eventually everyone knew except Alan. When Alan found out he threatened to take Peyton from Beth and kill Coop if she didn't marry him. On the way to stop the wedding Coop got into a car accident. Phillip, who had been presumed dead for nearly five years, had recently decided to return to Springfield, and found Coop after the accident. He took him to the hospital, then went to the church to tell everyone what had happened. Beth was shocked to see Phillip alive, and then jolted to learn that Coop was clinging to life. Beth visited Coop on his deathbed, and his sacrifice made her decide not to marry Alan. During the relationship of Beth and Coop he wrote a book about their love and it was eventually published. Phillip's return jolted the entire Spaulding family,<ref name=\"michaelfairmansoaps.com\"/> and they barely had time to adjust when Beth's and Phillip's 19-year-old son, James, returned from boarding school. James was running a [[Ponzi scheme]] and even when Phillip helped clear the charges against him, he resented Phillip's return. Beth was torn between the love of her life and the son who had only known the worst of his father. During this time Beth also helped her daughter Lizzie marry [[Bill Lewis III|Bill Lewis]].\n\nEventually, Phillip learned he was dying.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112816770|title='Guiding Light' Extinguished After 72 Years On Air|website=npr.org}}</ref> He didn't tell anyone, aside from Lillian (who was a nurse), and tried to repair the relationships in his life with the time he had left. Beth found out in what were supposed to be Phillip's last days, and she felt devastated as well as betrayed by Phillip and by her mother. Fortunately for Phillip, Alan agreed to a bone marrow transplant, and saved his son's life, but a few days later, Alan quietly died after attending the double wedding of Lillian and [[Buzz Cooper]] and Vanessa Chamberlain and [[Billy Lewis II|Billy Lewis]]. Beth was forced to break the news to her young daughter Peyton. Shortly before Alan's death, Phillip had proposed to Beth, and she had happily accepted. James and Phillip were now reconciled and Lizzie was trying for a baby. Beth also decided to return to her first love, drawing. A year later, Beth and Phillip were happily remarried, and were celebrating the upcoming nuptials of their best friends Rick and Mindy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/09/guiding-light-finale.html|title=The GUIDING LIGHT Finale|website=www.welovesoaps.net}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayers ==\n[[Judi Evans]] debuted in the role in May 1983 and remained with the show until July 1986.

She is the mother of [[Lizzie Spaulding|Lizzie]], [[James Spaulding (GL)|James]], and [[Peyton Spaulding]] and is known for her tumultuous relationship with her husband [[Phillip Spaulding]].\n\n==Background==\nThe character of Beth Raines has been half of two supercouples: Beth and Lujack Luvonaczek ([[Vincent Irizarry]]) and Beth and Philip Spaulding ([[Grant Aleksander]]). Beth has also been married to Philip's father, Alan Spaulding ([[Ron Raines]]) and Philip's best friend Rick Bauer ([[Michael O'Leary (actor)|Michael O'Leary]]). Beth, Philip, Rick and Mindy Lewis ([[Krista Tesreau]]) called themselves \"The Four Musketeers\" in the 1980s. Together they were four best friends with an unbreakable bond.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1983\u201386===\nFrom the start, the character of Beth Raines was a recognized fan favorite. ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' named her 1984's Most Beleaguered Heroine, called her a part of \"one of the top triangles ever to grace daytime\" and compared later storylines to General Hospital's romantic/adventure couple Luke and Laura.<ref>''Soap Opera Digest'', 1984</ref>\n\nBeth Raines first appeared on Guiding Light in the spring of 1983. Beth was acknowledged to have been born March 16, 1966. Her biological father was killed in Vietnam. Her mother, Lillian, a nurse, had remarried Bradley Raines. In 1983, a 17-year-old Beth was admitted to Cedars Hospital as an unconscious victim of an abusive stepfather. Her roommate was [[Mindy Lewis]]. Mindy was friends with two orderlies, [[Phillip Spaulding]] and Rick Bauer. The four of them formed a fast friendship, nicknamed \"The Four Musketeers\" which quickly developed into a romantic quadrangle. Beth was a shy, artistic teenager. Philip and Mindy, both heirs to two of Springfield's premier families, were dating when Philip fell for Beth who was dating Rick. Fate seemed to be pushing Philip and Beth together when they were named king and queen at their high school prom.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345339312|title=Guiding Light: A 50th Anniversary Celebration|first=search|last=results|date=12 December 1986|publisher=Ballantine Books|via=Amazon}}</ref> When a traumatized Beth became nearly catatonic after being raped by her stepfather, the two of them ran away to New York City.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref> The storyline took place at Christmas time and introduced the character of Nick, a Santa-like figure who would make later appearances on the show throughout the years around the holiday season. The location shoot was plagued by bad weather and a need for many reshoots. However, the result was a charming memorable love story that [[Grant Aleksander]] (Philip) said was worth the extra effort. They returned to be married, but discovered that Mindy, Beth's maid of honor, was pregnant with Philip's child, and Philip married Mindy instead.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\"/>\n\nBeth moved on with a gangleader named Brandon Luvoneczek, who called himself Lujack .<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Lujack eventually learned that [[Alexandra Spaulding]] was his mother. Beth was temporarily blinded in an explosion, when a jealous Philip hired someone to blow up a bar that Lujack was building with one of his past theft victims, Floyd Parker (Tom Nielsen).<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com\"/> Lujack was accused of the murder of Andy Ferris (whom Philip had paid to blow up Lujack's bar). Lujack was eventually cleared and pursued his music career, but was killed in an explosion on a ship, leaving a heartbroken Beth to eventually reunite with Philip briefly before being kidnapped and presumed dead in 1986.<ref>https://www.soapcentral.com/gl/whoswho/lujack.php</ref>\n\n===1989\u20131991===\nIn 1989, paintings of Beth surface and Philip becomes convinced that she is still alive. Meanwhile, Beth has returned to Springfield with Neil Everest, but with amnesia and unable to speak. A run-in with Bradley leads to her recovering her memory and eventually making amends with her stepfather. That December, Philip and Beth are reunited at the Willow Hills Sanitarium, where Philip stops Beth's marriage to Neil and Beth regains her speech.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-page-2-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline Page 2|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref> In 1990, Neil helps Beth recall what really happened when she was believed to be dead. She reveals that she killed her abductor, Professor Blackburn, when he tried to attack her. She sleeps with Philip who is at this time married to Blake, who refuses to grant him a divorce. When she finds out she's pregnant, she's unsure of the baby's paternity. She thinks it is Neil but later finds out that it's Philip. Neil is killed in an explosion that Philip is accused of causing.  Philip, with the help of Rick and Beth, fakes his death to escape jail time. Beth and Rick marry to throw off suspicion related to Philip's fake death. Philip returns in October, and Beth gives birth to a daughter, Elizabeth Spualding (Lizzie), in November. In December, Beth and Rick divorce. Rick becomes Lizzie's godfather. The following year (1991) Philip and Beth marry and moved to Arizona with Lizzie.\n\n===1997-2001===\nIn 1996, Philip and Beth were divorced off-screen.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Beth returns to Springfield with Lizzie (played by [[Hayden Panettiere]]). Philip is dating [[Harley Cooper]]. Beth begins to date Ben Warren and announces to Philip that she intends to stay in town. In 1998, she teams up with [[Annie Dutton]] to try to win Philip back from Harley. She is named as a suspect in the murder of Carl Stevens. It is later revealed that young Lizzie shot and killed Carl because he had abused her mother. She protects Lizzie and unhappily allows her to be in Philip and Harley's wedding. In 1998, Beth makes a play for Matt Reardon, but later dates Jim Lemay (legally father to Harley's daughter Susan, who she gave up for adoption as a teen mom). When Beth, Philip and Jim are in a plane crash, Jim escapes to find help. Beth and Philip, thinking they are about to die make love. After being rescued, Beth accepts Jim Lemay's proposal.<ref name=\"soapoperadigest.com1\"/> In 2000, Beth found out that she was pregnant with Philip's baby. She convinced Philip to allow her to pass the baby off as Jim's, in order to preserve both of their marriages. However, that same year, Lizzie is diagnosed with [[leukemia]]. Jim refuses to allow the doctors to induce labor in order to use the stem cells from the cord blood to save Lizzie's life. After breaking up and then reconciling, Jim saves Lizzie and baby James from a fire but died shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/gls-phillip-spaulding-timeline-page-3-0|title=GL's Phillip Spaulding Timeline Page 3|date=12 April 2004|website=soapoperadigest.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, Beth allows herself to be seduced by Prince Edmond Winslow of San Christobel and conspires with him to overthrow his brother, Prince Richard Winslow. She became a princess but divorced Edmond when she found out that he was holding Cassie prisoner. When she found out about it Edmund kept her in the same place he had been holding Cassie. She escaped and was saved by her ex Phillip. In 2001, Beth is presumed dead again when she is caught up in a flash flood in San Christobel.\n\n===2002-2009===\nEdmund later meets a country girl named Lorelei Hills who looks exactly like Beth. He convinces her to come to Springfield and scam the Spauldings out of Beth's fortune by convincing them that Beth wasn't really dead. The con is successful and Philip began to fall in love with \"Beth.\" When he realizes that she is an impostor, Lorelei and Edmond are jailed. In jail, Lorelei has flashbacks of Beth's life and it is revealed that she really is Beth, only she that had amnesia all this time. Her fingerprints match and it is confirmed that she is the real Beth. Lorelei/Beth now struggles with her split personality. Lorelei dominates temporarily and runs off with Edmund. Eventually Beth's personality wins out and she is reunited with Philip and Lizzie. Just as they start to get back on track, a lover from Lorelei's past comes to Springfield in the unlikely person of Bill Lewis, the son of Billy Lewis and Vanessa Chamberlin Reardon, who was last seen as a teenager and is now a young college student.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2004, Philip was presumed dead, after having been shot by his father, Alan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708161250/http://blogs.knoxnews.com/telebuddy/archives/2009/02/phillip-spauldi.shtml |archive-date=2012-07-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2006 Beth was shocked to learn that Rick not only helped him fake his death, but had kept that information from her and everyone in Springfield. Beth married Philip's father Alan to obtain security for herself and her children. When she miscarried their baby, he became obsessed with a Lizzie's pregnancy and trying to gain custody of the child, fathered by Jonathan Randall, son of Alan's one-time wife, [[Reva Shayne]]. Beth divorced Alan Spaulding, but despite his short-lived marriage to Doris Wolfe, and his near death at the hands of her daughter Ashley, Beth and Alan continued to bounce back and forth in their relationship. At one point, during the investigation to find out who shot Alan, Beth attempted to seduce Alan's other son, Alan-Michael, but was unsuccessful.\n\nBeth focused on protecting Lizzie and her baby from Alan and reconnected with Rick, who was at the time married to Mel Boudreaux and father to their daughter Leah. Beth, Rick and Alan formed an on-again/off-again triangle. The affair was revealed by Jonathan Randall in an angry outburst. Rick and Mel divorced and Beth became pregnant, but paternity was uncertain. A distraught Cassie tampered with the paternity test to show that Rick was the father of Beth's baby, and Beth was married to Rick on the Fourth of July by Josh Lewis, who had become a preacher. Cassie blamed Alan for the death of her daughter Tammy, and wanted ostensibly to \"protect Beth's child from having Alan Spaulding as a father.\"  Lizzie was dismayed and angry that she hadn't been invited and was one of the last people to find out. Thinking the baby was a Bauer, Beth named the baby Bernadette as a tribute to Bert Bauer, Rick's grandmother. At Bernadette's baptism, Reva blurted out the truth in order to save her own son from Alan's wrath. Beth decided instead after some additional thought to rename her daughter Peyton Alexandra Raines instead of Bernadette Bauer.\n\nBeth decided to go to law school, but her personal life remained more murky. When Alan had a brain tumor and started having visions of his dead son Gus, Beth started a relationship with Henry Cooper \"Coop\" Bradshaw who had been previously engaged to her daughter Lizzie.<ref name=\"michaelfairmansoaps.com\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelfairmansoaps.com/guiding-light/the-beth-chamberlin-interview-guiding-light/2009/02/07/|title=THE BETH CHAMBERLIN INTERVIEW- GUIDING LIGHT|website=michaelfairmansoaps.com}}</ref> The relationship was supposed to be kept secret so Alan wouldn't find out but eventually everyone knew except Alan. When Alan found out he threatened to take Peyton from Beth and kill Coop if she didn't marry him. On the way to stop the wedding Coop got into a car accident. Phillip, who had been presumed dead for nearly five years, had recently decided to return to Springfield, and found Coop after the accident. He took him to the hospital, then went to the church to tell everyone what had happened. Beth was shocked to see Phillip alive, and then jolted to learn that Coop was clinging to life. Beth visited Coop on his deathbed, and his sacrifice made her decide not to marry Alan. During the relationship of Beth and Coop he wrote a book about their love and it was eventually published. Phillip's return jolted the entire Spaulding family,<ref name=\"michaelfairmansoaps.com\"/> and they barely had time to adjust when Beth's and Phillip's 19-year-old son, James, returned from boarding school. James was running a [[Ponzi scheme]] and even when Phillip helped clear the charges against him, he resented Phillip's return. Beth was torn between the love of her life and the son who had only known the worst of his father. During this time Beth also helped her daughter Lizzie marry [[Bill Lewis III|Bill Lewis]].\n\nEventually, Phillip learned he was dying.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112816770|title='Guiding Light' Extinguished After 72 Years On Air|website=npr.org}}</ref> He didn't tell anyone, aside from Lillian (who was a nurse), and tried to repair the relationships in his life with the time he had left. Beth found out in what were supposed to be Phillip's last days, and she felt devastated as well as betrayed by Phillip and by her mother. Fortunately for Phillip, Alan agreed to a bone marrow transplant, and saved his son's life, but a few days later, Alan quietly died after attending the double wedding of Lillian and [[Buzz Cooper]] and Vanessa Chamberlain and [[Billy Lewis II|Billy Lewis]]. Beth was forced to break the news to her young daughter Peyton. Shortly before Alan's death, Phillip had proposed to Beth, and she had happily accepted. James and Phillip were now reconciled and Lizzie was trying for a baby. Beth also decided to return to her first love, drawing. A year later, Beth and Phillip were happily remarried, and were celebrating the upcoming nuptials of their best friends Rick and Mindy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welovesoaps.net/2009/09/guiding-light-finale.html|title=The GUIDING LIGHT Finale|website=www.welovesoaps.net}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayers ==\n[[Judi Evans]] debuted in the role in May 1983 and remained with the show until July 1986.

The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in the 19th-century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/ripper-street/blog/2012/12/whitechapel|title=Whitechapel|website=BBC America|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18}}</ref>\n\nThe Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the [[parish]] had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.<ref name=\"ellis\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at [[St John's College, Oxford]] to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \"University Settlement of East London\" was set up by Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Picht|first=Werner|title=Toynbee Hall and the English Settlement Movement|publisher=G.

At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors.

They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the [[parish]] had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church.<ref name=\"Abel\"/> In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it.<ref name=\"ellis\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at [[St John's College, Oxford]] to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \"University Settlement of East London\" was set up by Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Picht|first=Werner|title=Toynbee Hall and the English Settlement Movement|publisher=G.
