[[Grace Slick]] and [[Mickey Thomas (singer)|Mickey Thomas]], co-lead vocalists of [[Starship (band)|Starship]] at the time, provide additional background vocals on the song.\n\n==Background==\nThe song was originally recorded in 1983 by Canadian rock group [[Toronto (band)|Toronto]], of which songwriters Sheron Alton and Brian Allen were members. (The other songwriter, [[Jim Vallance]], was not a member of Toronto, though he played drums on Toronto's recording of the song.)  However, the rest of the band elected not to release the song, and the frustration Allen and Alton faced in being unable to convince their bandmates to feature this and other material on Toronto's albums led to their departure from the group.  \n\nLater, Michael McCarty at ATV Music Publishing was reviewing his song catalogue when he came across \"What About Love\".  He offered the song to Heart, who turned it into a worldwide hit.  Toronto's original version remained commercially unreleased until 2002, when it appeared as a bonus cut on the CD's 'Get It On Credit' and ''Toronto: The Greatest Hits''.\n\n==Reception==\nThe song's sound marked a considerable change in the musical direction for Heart, moving from the hard rock and folk rock of their earlier work to a more polished, [[power ballad]] sound.  \"What About Love\" received extensive airplay on [[MTV]] and returned Heart to the Top-10 of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the first time in five years, peaking at #10.\n\nThe song peaked at #14 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] upon its re-release in 1988.

There appear to have been several waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas by way of the [[Bering land bridge]],<ref>Naske and Slotnick, 1987, pp. 9\u201310.</ref> which became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation. By about 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupiit had settled along the coastal areas of what would become western Alaska, with migrations up the coastal rivers&mdash;notably the [[Yukon River|Yukon]] and [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]]&mdash;around 1400 AD, eventually reaching as far upriver as [[Paimiut, Alaska|Paimiut]] on the Yukon and [[Crow Village, Alaska|Crow Village]] on the Kuskokwim.<ref name=\"frboundariesAJ\"/>\n\nThe Siberian Yupik may represent a back-migration of the Eskimo people to Siberia from Alaska.<ref>\"New Light on first peopling of the Americas (summer 2015),\" ''Popular Archaeology'',http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/summer-2015/article/new-light-on-first-peopling-of-the-americas, accessed 10 Mar 2017</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Alaska yupik mask.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Yup'ik mask]], [[Sitka, Alaska]], collection of the [[Alaska State Museum]]]]\n[[File:Central Yup'ik basket (UBC-2011).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Yup'ik basket.]]\nTraditionally, families spent the spring and summer at fish camp, then joined with others at village sites for the winter. Many families still harvest the traditional subsistence resources, especially [[Pacific salmon]] and [[seal (mammal)|seal]].\n\nThe men's communal house, the ''[[qasgiq]]'', was the community center for ceremonies and festivals which included singing, dancing, and [[storytelling]]. The qasgiq was used mainly in the winter months, because people would travel in family groups following food sources throughout the spring, summer, and fall months. Aside from ceremonies and festivals, the qasgiq was also where the men taught the young boys survival and hunting skills, as well as other life lessons. The young boys were also taught how to make tools and [[qayaq]]s ([[kayaks]]) during the winter months in the qasgiq. The ceremonies involve a [[shaman]].\n\nThe women's house, the ''ena'', was traditionally right next door. In some areas they were connected by a tunnel. Women taught the young girls how to tan hides and sew, process and cook game and fish, and weave. Boys would live with their mothers until they were about five years old, then they would live in the qasgiq. Each winter, for a period of between three and six weeks, the young boys and young girls would switch roles, with the men teaching the girls survival and hunting skills and toolmaking, and the women teaching the boys how to sew and cook.\n\nIn Yup'ik group [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], individuals often remain stationary while moving their upper body and arms rhythmically, their gestures accentuated by hand held dance fans, very similar in design to Cherokee dance fans. The limited motion by no means limits the expressiveness of the dances, which can be gracefully flowing, bursting with energy, or wryly humorous.\n\nThe Yup'ik are unique among native peoples of the Americas in that they name children after the last person in the community to have died.\n\nThe [[kuspuk]] (''qaspeq'') is a traditional Yup'ik garment, worn in both casual and formal settings in Alaska. The [[seal-oil lamp]] ''(naniq)'' was an important piece of furniture.<ref>[http://www.nmai.si.edu/searchcollections/results.aspx?objtype=Furnishings+(Home)&objid=Lamp National Museum of the American Indian : Yup'ik (Yupik Eskimo) Lamps]</ref>\n\n== Languages ==\n{{Main article|Yupik languages}}\n\nThe five [[Yupik language]]s (related to [[Inuktitut]]) are still very widely spoken; more than 75% of the Yupik/Yup'ik population are fluent in the language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Alaskan and Siberian Yupik, like the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], adopted the system of writing developed by [[Moravian Church]] missionaries during the 1760s in [[Greenland]].

There appear to have been several waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas by way of the [[Bering land bridge]],<ref>Naske and Slotnick, 1987, pp. 9\u201310.</ref> which became exposed between 20,000 and 8,000 years ago during periods of glaciation. By about 3,000 years ago, the progenitors of the Yupiit had settled along the coastal areas of what would become western Alaska, with migrations up the coastal rivers&mdash;notably the [[Yukon River|Yukon]] and [[Kuskokwim River|Kuskokwim]]&mdash;around 1400 AD, eventually reaching as far upriver as [[Paimiut, Alaska|Paimiut]] on the Yukon and [[Crow Village, Alaska|Crow Village]] on the Kuskokwim.<ref name=\"frboundariesAJ\"/>\n\nThe Siberian Yupik may represent a back-migration of the Eskimo people to Siberia from Alaska.<ref>\"New Light on first peopling of the Americas (summer 2015),\" ''Popular Archaeology'',http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/summer-2015/article/new-light-on-first-peopling-of-the-americas, accessed 10 Mar 2017</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Alaska yupik mask.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Yup'ik mask]], [[Sitka, Alaska]], collection of the [[Alaska State Museum]]]]\n[[File:Central Yup'ik basket (UBC-2011).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|Yup'ik basket.]]\nTraditionally, families spent the spring and summer at fish camp, then joined with others at village sites for the winter. Many families still harvest the traditional subsistence resources, especially [[Pacific salmon]] and [[seal (mammal)|seal]].\n\nThe men's communal house, the ''[[qasgiq]]'', was the community center for ceremonies and festivals which included singing, dancing, and [[storytelling]]. The qasgiq was used mainly in the winter months, because people would travel in family groups following food sources throughout the spring, summer, and fall months. Aside from ceremonies and festivals, the qasgiq was also where the men taught the young boys survival and hunting skills, as well as other life lessons. The young boys were also taught how to make tools and [[qayaq]]s ([[kayaks]]) during the winter months in the qasgiq. The ceremonies involve a [[shaman]].\n\nThe women's house, the ''ena'', was traditionally right next door. In some areas they were connected by a tunnel. Women taught the young girls how to tan hides and sew, process and cook game and fish, and weave. Boys would live with their mothers until they were about five years old, then they would live in the qasgiq. Each winter, for a period of between three and six weeks, the young boys and young girls would switch roles, with the men teaching the girls survival and hunting skills and toolmaking, and the women teaching the boys how to sew and cook.\n\nIn Yup'ik group [[Yup'ik dancing|dances]], individuals often remain stationary while moving their upper body and arms rhythmically, their gestures accentuated by hand held dance fans, very similar in design to Cherokee dance fans. The limited motion by no means limits the expressiveness of the dances, which can be gracefully flowing, bursting with energy, or wryly humorous.\n\nThe Yup'ik are unique among native peoples of the Americas in that they name children after the last person in the community to have died.\n\nThe [[kuspuk]] (''qaspeq'') is a traditional Yup'ik garment, worn in both casual and formal settings in Alaska. The [[seal-oil lamp]] ''(naniq)'' was an important piece of furniture.<ref>[http://www.nmai.si.edu/searchcollections/results.aspx?objtype=Furnishings+(Home)&objid=Lamp National Museum of the American Indian : Yup'ik (Yupik Eskimo) Lamps]</ref>\n\n== Languages ==\n{{Main article|Yupik languages}}\n\nThe five [[Yupik language]]s (related to [[Inuktitut]]) are still very widely spoken; more than 75% of the Yupik/Yup'ik population are fluent in the language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe Alaskan and Siberian Yupik, like the Alaskan [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], adopted the system of writing developed by [[Moravian Church]] missionaries during the 1760s in [[Greenland]].

What followed was a move to channel 27 as '''W27BS''' (January 9, 1997) and an attempt to move to channel 61, which would have made the station '''W61DD''' \u2013 the same day the change was made in FCC records (July 1, 1999), the calls changed again to '''W31CD''' and the station moved to channel 31. On May 31, 2000, W31CD became '''WPMF-LP''', and a year later, WPMF received a class A television license (though its calls retained the -LP suffix). The station received its license to broadcast digitally on January 3, 2014, at which point the call sign changed to '''WPMF-CD'''.\n\nWPMF-LP joined [[Azteca Am\u00e9rica]] in November 2002.<ref name=\"ss-wpmfaza\">{{cite news|last1=Morales|first1=Magaly|title=Azteca, Fourth Latin Network, Airs On Ch. 31|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-11-27/lifestyle/0211260278_1_azteca-america-tv-azteca-latin-emmy-awards|accessdate=January 7, 2018|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|language=en|date=November 27, 2002}}</ref> In 2011, it switched to My Family TV, which became [[The Family Channel (U.S. TV network)|The Family Channel]] in 2013.

It premiered on January 29, 2000, and was theatrically released on February 11, 2000, becoming the first film of the 2000s made by Paramount. The film was met with generally negative reviews, but was a box office success, and  [[Hoku]]'s \"[[Another Dumb Blonde]]\" became the biggest chart smash of her career. It was released on home video on October 3, 2000, and re-released on September 26, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a narration by Hal Brandston, ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) explaining how a snowflake is formed. The film changes to his father, a news reporter, Tom Brandston, ([[Chevy Chase]]) giving the weather report before walking away backstage, annoyed with his job, before seeing another reporter, Chad Symmonz, ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]) who tries to be better than Tom, giving a false report on a forecast. This makes Tom resent him even further. The film then changes to Hal, trying to get noticed by Claire Bonner ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]), a girl that he really likes. After he slips and falls in the water, Hal notices Claire's [[anklet]], with a whale insignia, at the bottom. He swims over and grabs it, wanting to return it to her, but he expresses that he is too shy to talk to her. The film then changes focus to a group of elementary school students, led by Hal's sister, Natalie (Zena Grey), who wants to have a snow day. She hits her school's principal, Principal Weaver, with a snowball, and wanting to know who hit him, he holds up a radio, while cheering that there is no snow coming. (This becomes a running gag, literally, where he gets hit with numerous snowballs by unseen kids and gets no help from the onlookers). When she wishes for it to snow that night, Tom notices a huge snow storm that will happen overnight, proving Chad's forecast wrong.\n\nWaking up the next morning, Natalie notices snow all over town, and all the kids cheer, after their school is announced to be closed for a snow day. Right before she goes outside, Natalie notices a mean snowplow driver, who the kids call \"Snowplow Man\" ([[Chris Elliott]]) from plowing the streets. Meanwhile, Hal tries to win the heart of Claire, while still trying to return her anklet, with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard ([[Schuyler Fisk]]), who secretly harbors feelings for him. Also, Hal and Natalie's workaholic mother, Laura Brandston ([[Jean Smart]]), is stuck at home with their mischievous brother, Randy, who is bored to death, and wants to go play in the snow. Eventually, Natalie and her friends, Wayne ([[Josh Peck]]) and Chet ([[Jade Yorker]]), build an igloo, but it is quickly destroyed by Snowplow Man, who gets revenge on them for hitting him with a snowball. They eventually come up with a plan to take over the plow and move all the snow back in the streets, by having ketchup poured all over Wayne, who pretends to be dead. As Snowplow Man checks out the scene, Natalie and Chet steal his bird, Trudy, so Snowplow Man kidnaps Wayne, wanting an exchange for his bird. After he refuses to give them an extra snow day, but still returning Wayne and the bird, Natalie decides that extreme measures need to be taken. After trying to talk to Claire many times, even going to her house, only to see that everyone found out about her break-up with her mean and ill-tempered boyfriend, Chuck Wheeler, ([[David Paetkau]]), Hal decides to see how things end up between them. He and Claire share a look after she and Chuck ride away on Chuck's snowmobile. Hal decides to try another way of getting her attention, by going to the skating rink, and Lane lures the radio announcer ([[Iggy Pop]]), into the bathroom.\n\nHal takes advantage of the radio and talks to Claire, in front of everyone, and Chuck, who views Hal as a target for his \"House Of Pain\". (Which is just having his friends beat Hal up, and it is revealed that Chuck knows nothing about Claire). Later, Hal tries again to get Claire's attention by making a whale-shaped figure in the snow with a shovel. Chuck finds him though, while following Claire, and tries to attack Hal, but he reveals he is not afraid of him. Hal runs and jumps on Chuck's jet ski, riding away into the woods, with Chuck and his followers gaining on him. But Chuck is quickly outsmarted and lands in a kid's snowman. Later, Tom is reporting at an ice-sculpting contest, and notices a statue of Chad, which infuriates him so much, he tries to take a kids' ice pick, intending on destroying the statue. But, when it falls, Chad begins humiliating Tom, so Tom tries asking Chad where snow comes from. Chad, trying to save himself, slowly ends up revealing that he is a fraud. The crowd calls him a loser, and he leaves for good, after the crowd cheers Tom's name, bringing his career back up. That night, Natalie and Chet reveal that they gathered all the kids in town to confront Snowplow Man, as he makes his way to the last snow covered street. They all tie him up, and he insults them after they laugh at him. Chet starts singing the Snowplow Man's theme song about his plow, (Which he calls \"Clementine\"). They leave him tied up, as everyone goes to cover the roads. Knowing he is defeated, Snowplow Man accepts his fate, and calls to his bird. Later, Hal soon realizes out he loves Lane instead of Claire. He is even encouraged by Claire to go after her. After one last stand to Chuck, and almost being beaten senseless, Natalie plows right into Chuck, who gets covered in snow, unable to get up, and rescuing Hal in the process. Also, Hal finally admits to Lane that he loves her, and they share a kiss. Natalie is happy that her and her friends finally got a second snow day, and they drive the plow away. Laura takes the day off from work to look after Randy, even playing in the snow with him. Hal, Natalie, Lane, Randy, Laura, Tom, and Claire are finally happy with having found new paths in their lives. When Principal Weaver gets home, thinking he is safe, the kids (who somehow got into his house), hit him with a lot of snowballs as he cries in defeat and the film ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]] as Hal Brandston\n* [[Schuyler Fisk]] as Lane Leonard\n* Zena Grey as Natalie Brandston\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Roger \"Snowplowman\" Stubblefield\n* [[Jean Smart]] as Laura Brandston\n* [[Chevy Chase]] as Tom Brandston\n* [[Emmanuelle Chriqui]] as Claire Bonner\n* [[Iggy Pop]] as Mr. Zellweger\n* [[Pam Grier]] as Tina\n* [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] as Chad Symmonz\n* [[Josh Peck]] as Wayne Alworth\n* [[Jade Yorker]] as Chet Felker\n* [[Damian Young]] as Principal Ken Weaver\n* Connor Matheus as Randy Brandston\n* [[J.

It premiered on January 29, 2000, and was theatrically released on February 11, 2000, becoming the first film of the 2000s made by Paramount. The film was met with generally negative reviews, but was a box office success, and also [[Hoku]]'s \"[[Another Dumb Blonde]]\" became her biggest chart smash of her career. It was released on home video on October 3, 2000, and re-released on September 26, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a narration by Hal Brandston, ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]) explaining how a snowflake is formed. The film changes to his father, a news reporter, Tom Brandston, ([[Chevy Chase]]) giving the weather report before walking away backstage, annoyed with his job, before seeing another reporter, Chad Symmonz, ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]) who tries to be better than Tom, giving a false report on a forecast. This makes Tom resent him even further. The film then changes to Hal, trying to get noticed by Claire Bonner ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]), a girl that he really likes. After he slips and falls in the water, Hal notices Claire's [[anklet]], with a whale insignia, at the bottom. He swims over and grabs it, wanting to return it to her, but he expresses that he is too shy to talk to her. The film then changes focus to a group of elementary school students, led by Hal's sister, Natalie (Zena Grey), who wants to have a snow day. She hits her school's principal, Principal Weaver, with a snowball, and wanting to know who hit him, he holds up a radio, while cheering that there is no snow coming. (This becomes a running gag, literally, where he gets hit with numerous snowballs by unseen kids and gets no help from the onlookers). When she wishes for it to snow that night, Tom notices a huge snow storm that will happen overnight, proving Chad's forecast wrong.\n\nWaking up the next morning, Natalie notices snow all over town, and all the kids cheer, after their school is announced to be closed for a snow day. Right before she goes outside, Natalie notices a mean snowplow driver, who the kids call \"Snowplow Man\" ([[Chris Elliott]]) from plowing the streets. Meanwhile, Hal tries to win the heart of Claire, while still trying to return her anklet, with the help of his best friend, Lane Leonard ([[Schuyler Fisk]]), who secretly harbors feelings for him. Also, Hal and Natalie's workaholic mother, Laura Brandston ([[Jean Smart]]), is stuck at home with their mischievous brother, Randy, who is bored to death, and wants to go play in the snow. Eventually, Natalie and her friends, Wayne ([[Josh Peck]]) and Chet ([[Jade Yorker]]), build an igloo, but it is quickly destroyed by Snowplow Man, who gets revenge on them for hitting him with a snowball. They eventually come up with a plan to take over the plow and move all the snow back in the streets, by having ketchup poured all over Wayne, who pretends to be dead. As Snowplow Man checks out the scene, Natalie and Chet steal his bird, Trudy, so Snowplow Man kidnaps Wayne, wanting an exchange for his bird. After he refuses to give them an extra snow day, but still returning Wayne and the bird, Natalie decides that extreme measures need to be taken. After trying to talk to Claire many times, even going to her house, only to see that everyone found out about her break-up with her mean and ill-tempered boyfriend, Chuck Wheeler, ([[David Paetkau]]), Hal decides to see how things end up between them. He and Claire share a look after she and Chuck ride away on Chuck's snowmobile. Hal decides to try another way of getting her attention, by going to the skating rink, and Lane lures the radio announcer ([[Iggy Pop]]), into the bathroom.\n\nHal takes advantage of the radio and talks to Claire, in front of everyone, and Chuck, who views Hal as a target for his \"House Of Pain\". (Which is just having his friends beat Hal up, and it is revealed that Chuck knows nothing about Claire). Later, Hal tries again to get Claire's attention by making a whale-shaped figure in the snow with a shovel. Chuck finds him though, while following Claire, and tries to attack Hal, but he reveals he is not afraid of him. Hal runs and jumps on Chuck's jet ski, riding away into the woods, with Chuck and his followers gaining on him. But Chuck is quickly outsmarted and lands in a kid's snowman. Later, Tom is reporting at an ice-sculpting contest, and notices a statue of Chad, which infuriates him so much, he tries to take a kids' ice pick, intending on destroying the statue. But, when it falls, Chad begins humiliating Tom, so Tom tries asking Chad where snow comes from. Chad, trying to save himself, slowly ends up revealing that he is a fraud.
