The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

It's almost as if we as readers are as much in a fantasy world as Paul is himself.

When Paul has a meeting with his instructors and the principal, he puts on a smile. The narrator notes that other boys would be more afraid than Paul was and would most likely have given in to an emotional and remorseful response about their disruptive behaviors. Paul's smile in this circumstance displays his cocky attitude and shows that he doesn't care about what the authorities have to say to him.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://englishivbl2b.pbworks.com/w/page/19070348/%22Paul%27s%20Case%22%20--%20Cork%20Terborg,%20Payton%20Laczynski,%20Katie%20Erickson|title=English / \"Paul's Case\" -- Cork Terborg, Payton Laczynski, Katie Erickson|website=englishivbl2b.pbworks.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A different interpretation of Paul's smile arises from the detail where Paul's drawing master claimed there was, \"something sort of haunted about [his smile],\" which is a detail that is often used to support the idea that Paul's smile refers to him having a disability.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''The Basement:''' During the story, Paul sneaks into his home through his basement and reflects on his relationship with his father.

Paul tries to greet each customer and provide them with exceptional customer service. Besides, Paul loves watching the concerts and other social events that are happening at the Hall. Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him. Paul was himself and he felt a level of sense of approval at the theater.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad' s job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him.

This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city.

Its first mine, north of town on the river's west side, was exhausted by 1873.

Considered progressive at the time, it diluted the votes of ethnic and national minorities, who generally could not command the majority to elect a candidate of their choice.\n\nThat form of government was scrapped in 1950 in favor of a [[council-manager]] government, with the council members elected at-large. In 1967, the city changed its government to elect four of the seven city council members from [[single-member district]]s or wards, rather than at-large. This enabled broader representation of voters. As with many major urban areas, the city core began losing population to the suburbs in the 1960s (the peak population of 208,982 was recorded in 1960), as highway construction led to new residential construction outside the city.

They recorded their Zao debut, and [[Solid State Records]] debut, ''[[Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest]]''. In 1998, Zao recorded the ''Training for Utopia / Zao'' split [[Extended play|EP]] with [[Training for Utopia]].\n\nAfter recording the EP, Detar left, and was replaced by Scott Mellinger (formerly of [[Creation Is Crucifixion]]).

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

Other guitars, such as acoustic guitars, may require additional hardware, such as a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]].

Notes represented as colored rectangles, matching the color of the guitar string(s) to be held down, move from the background to the foreground along numbered lanes reflecting the fret position. The notes turn 90 degrees at the moment that they should be strummed; additional markers are provided to help with timing of future notes.  Additionally, the game shows an ideal position for the player's hand on the fretboard for the current segment of the song, moving this up and down as necessary. Lyrics to the song, if any, are shown in a karaoke-style under the background note pattern, but otherwise do not impact gameplay. Prior to playing any song, the game has the player check the tuning of the guitar.\n\nA core feature of normal play is the game's ability to adjust the note density \u2013 effectively the difficulty \u2013 of the current song based on the player's performance to that point. Each song is split into a number of phases, and depending on how accurate the player is during a phase, a subsequent phase may provide more difficult note patterns. If the player's accuracy is not good during a phase, the subsequent one will fall back to a lower difficulty level. The player gets points for each note hit, and thus staying at higher difficulty levels can earn more points, but it is impossible for the player to fail a song. In some cases, if the player is missing too many notes, the game will pause the song to allow the player to readjust their hand position and make sure they strum the right note before proceeding. The game saves the last note density level that the player completed a song at, and will use that level at the start of the next play through that song.\n\nAs the player completes songs or other games modes within the career, they earn \"Rocksmith points\", similar to [[experience point]]s, which unlock additional features. New venues, shown in the background of the main gameplay screens and having subtle influences on the sound of the guitar or bass, and new guitars and basses become available, as well as additional game modes. Some of these modes in the game are designed to help the player practice specific techniques. Technique Challenges, for both guitar and bass, give practice to some of the common tricks for the two instruments, such as hammer-ons/pull-offs, Chords, and Power Chords for guitar, and two-finger plucking and syncopation for bass. Each song can also be played in a Riff Repeater mode, where the player can select a specific section of song to practice and perfect, with options on controlling the speed and note density level. A \"Guitarcade\" becomes available after completing one of the Technique Challenges, which incorporates that technique into a mini-game element, such as \"Ducks\", a ''[[Galaga]]''-like shoot-em-up, where the player must get their fretboard positions correct to fire on targets approaching in various lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2011/9/28/previews/83460/ |title=PS3/X360 Preview \u2013 'Rocksmith' |publisher=Worthplaying |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Finally, the player can gain access to a free play mode, which uses [[amplifier modeling]] to simulate the sound of a guitar as played through stage equipment. The modeling supports a variety of virtual hardware components, such as effects pedals and amplifiers, which can also be unlocked through career mode. Each song includes a custom sound bank referred to as an \"authentic tone\" designed to make the player's guitar sound as close to the original guitar tone of the song as possible, though they can override these with the virtual pedals and amplifiers.\n\n==Development==\n''Rocksmith'' has its origins in a project called ''Guitar Rising''. ''Guitar Rising'' was developed by Game Tank, a small startup business, and was showcased at the 2008 [[Game Developers Conference]]. The game, at that time, was more of a technology demonstration, to display the ability of proprietary hardware \u2013 a USB cable that plugged into the audio-out jack of nearly any electric guitar \u2013 to determine what notes and chords the player was performing, instead of the typical note-matching gameplay of games like ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' or ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/02/gdc-guitar-rising-will-actually-teach-you-to-play-guitar/ | title = GDC: Guitar Rising, training for real Guitar Heroes | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | publisher = Ars Technica }}</ref> The demonstration at GDC featured gameplay elements that would be taken into ''Rocksmith''; the interface would show notes colored by string and numbered by fret, and that as the player progressed in the song, the difficulty or note-density would change to reflect how well the player was doing, as to avoid frustrating the player with too-difficult charts.<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name =ausgamers/> Jake Parks of Game Tank had stated at the time that they were looking to release the game in late 2008, anticipating a soundtrack of about thirty songs depending on licensing.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/27/guitar-rising-interview | title = Guitar Rising Interview | first = Richard | last = Aihoshi | date = 2008-03-27 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | publisher = IGN }}</ref> Later, the title was pushed to a 2009 release.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2338306,00.asp | title = Beyond Guitar Hero | first = Brittany | last = Peterson | date = 2009-01-29 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | work = [[PC Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\nAbout the same time, Ubisoft's president of North American operations, Laurent Detoc, challenged its San Francisco development team to develop their own game, as until this time, the studio only had supported external developers.<ref name=\"sfbiz\"/> The music game field was of interest; as stated by Detoc, \"I just could not believe the amount of waste that had gone in people spending so much time with plastic guitars\".<ref name=\"sfbiz\"/>  The studio was able to acquire Game Tank and the ''Guitar Rising'' technology, bringing aboard Parks and his lead designer Nick Bonardi as Ubisoft employees.

In some cases, if the player is missing too many notes, the game will pause the song to allow the player to readjust their hand position and make sure they strum the right note before proceeding. The game saves the last note density level that the player completed a song at, and will use that level at the start of the next play through that song.\n\nAs the player completes songs or other games modes within the career, they earn \"Rocksmith points\", similar to [[experience point]]s, which unlock additional features. New venues, shown in the background of the main gameplay screens and having subtle influences on the sound of the guitar or bass, and new guitars and basses become available, as well as additional game modes. Some of these modes in the game are designed to help the player practice specific techniques. Technique Challenges, for both guitar and bass, give practice to some of the common tricks for the two instruments, such as hammer-ons/pull-offs, Chords, and Power Chords for guitar, and two-finger plucking and syncopation for bass. Each song can also be played in a Riff Repeater mode, where the player can select a specific section of song to practice and perfect, with options on controlling the speed and note density level. A \"Guitarcade\" becomes available after completing one of the Technique Challenges, which incorporates that technique into a mini-game element, such as \"Ducks\", a ''[[Galaga]]''-like shoot-em-up, where the player must get their fretboard positions correct to fire on targets approaching in various lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2011/9/28/previews/83460/ |title=PS3/X360 Preview \u2013 'Rocksmith' |publisher=Worthplaying |date= |accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref> Finally, the player can gain access to a free play mode, which uses [[amplifier modeling]] to simulate the sound of a guitar as played through stage equipment. The modeling supports a variety of virtual hardware components, such as effects pedals and amplifiers, which can also be unlocked through career mode. Each song includes a custom sound bank referred to as an \"authentic tone\" designed to make the player's guitar sound as close to the original guitar tone of the song as possible, though they can override these with the virtual pedals and amplifiers.\n\n==Development==\n''Rocksmith'' has its origins in a project called ''Guitar Rising''. ''Guitar Rising'' was developed by Game Tank, a small startup business, and was showcased at the 2008 [[Game Developers Conference]]. The game, at that time, was more of a technology demonstration, to display the ability of proprietary hardware \u2013 a USB cable that plugged into the audio-out jack of nearly any electric guitar \u2013 to determine what notes and chords the player was performing, instead of the typical note-matching gameplay of games like ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' or ''[[Rock Band]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/02/gdc-guitar-rising-will-actually-teach-you-to-play-guitar/ | title = GDC: Guitar Rising, training for real Guitar Heroes | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | date = 2008-02-28 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | publisher = Ars Technica }}</ref> The demonstration at GDC featured gameplay elements that would be taken into ''Rocksmith''; the interface would show notes colored by string and numbered by fret, and that as the player progressed in the song, the difficulty or note-density would change to reflect how well the player was doing, as to avoid frustrating the player with too-difficult charts.<ref name=\"interview\"/><ref name =ausgamers/> Jake Parks of Game Tank had stated at the time that they were looking to release the game in late 2008, anticipating a soundtrack of about thirty songs depending on licensing.<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/03/27/guitar-rising-interview | title = Guitar Rising Interview | first = Richard | last = Aihoshi | date = 2008-03-27 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | publisher = IGN }}</ref> Later, the title was pushed to a 2009 release.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2338306,00.asp | title = Beyond Guitar Hero | first = Brittany | last = Peterson | date = 2009-01-29 | accessdate = 2013-01-28 | work = [[PC Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\nAbout the same time, Ubisoft's president of North American operations, Laurent Detoc, challenged its San Francisco development team to develop their own game, as until this time, the studio only had supported external developers.<ref name=\"sfbiz\"/> The music game field was of interest; as stated by Detoc, \"I just could not believe the amount of waste that had gone in people spending so much time with plastic guitars\".<ref name=\"sfbiz\"/>  The studio was able to acquire Game Tank and the ''Guitar Rising'' technology, bringing aboard Parks and his lead designer Nick Bonardi as Ubisoft employees.

A cautionary tale about [[filmmaking]], it tells the story of how in 1973, [[Peter Sellers]], one of the biggest [[comedy]] actors at the time, embarked on a pirate comedy for [[Columbia Pictures]] entitled [[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]]. He lost confidence with the film immediately and tried to sabotage it, first firing the producers before turning on his friend ''(and the film's young director)'', [[Peter Medak]]. Despite an illustrious career and the passing of 43 years since the unraveling of the production, Medak is still reeling from the disastrous experience and healing from the wounds inflicted by [[Peter Sellers]] and the film\u2019s failure. ''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' received its world premiere at the 2018 [[Venice Film Festival]] as part of the Giornate Degli Autori section, simultaneously receiving a US premiere at the 2018 [[Telluride Film Festival]].  \n\n''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' received widespread critical acclaim from [[Film criticism|film critics]] who praised Peter Medak's willingness to revisit a dark period both professionally and personally. The wider film community has taken the film under its wings as a rare insight to what happens when a [[Filmmaking|film production]] unravels. The documentary spent 2019 travelling to [[Film festival|film festivals]] around the world, picking up numerous [[Award|awards]], winning both The Golden Palm ''(best film competing in all categories)'' and Best Documentary at The [[Beverly Hills Film Festival]] in April 2019.  \n\n== Plot ==\nIn September 1973, Peter Sellers embarked on the production of a 17th Century pirate comedy in [[Cyprus]] for Columbia Pictures. What followed was a game of cat and mouse between Sellers, the young Director, [[Peter Medak]], cast, crew and movie executives as Sellers set about trying to shut down the film. The ill-fated production found Sellers in a personal and professional void. The recent collapse of his relationship with [[Liza Minnelli]] and a number of poorly received films spun him into a dark period, giving rise to a roller coaster of incidents during production, from sabotage to mutiny, from agonizing shooting schedules in 40 degrees to [[Spike Milligan]]\u2019s frantic on set re-writes. The film was somehow completed but rejected by Columbia and never theatrically released.\n\nAt its core lies a story of the insanity of the film but also the story of a young acclaimed Director firmly on a path to greatness. Peter Medak had made 3 back-to-back successes, most notably \u2018[[The Ruling Class (film)|The Ruling Class]]\u2019 in \u201872 with [[Peter O'Toole|Peter O\u2019 Toole]] (nominated both for the [[Palme d'Or|Palm D\u2019Or]] and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]) but this film had a significant affect on his career.\n\nAfter 42 years the wounds have barely heeled for Medak and this documentary is his opportunity to tell the story of what happened on that film and finally release the weight associated with its failure.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s parallel theme is the inner workings of the movie business and the lunacy of a production when it unravels and how the bankability of an actor can be the catalyst for a project but also its nemesis.\n\n''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' is a comic-tragic feature doc about what it takes to be a film director and survive your biggest disaster.\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating]] of 100%<ref>{{Citation|title=The Ghost of Peter Sellers (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_ghost_of_peter_sellers|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.

A cautionary tale about [[filmmaking]], it tells the story of how in 1973, [[Peter Sellers]], one of the biggest [[comedy]] actors at the time, embarked on a pirate comedy for [[Columbia Pictures]] entitled [[Ghost in the Noonday Sun]]. He lost confidence with the film immediately and tried to sabotage it, first firing the producers before turning on his friend ''(and the film's young director)'', [[Peter Medak]]. Despite an illustrious career and the passing of 43 years since the unraveling of the production, Medak is still reeling from the disastrous experience and healing from the wounds inflicted by [[Peter Sellers]] and the film\u2019s failure. ''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' received its world premiere at the 2018 [[Venice Film Festival]] as part of the Giornate Degli Autori section, simultaneously receiving a US premiere at the 2018 [[Telluride Film Festival]].  \n\n''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' received widespread critical acclaim from [[Film criticism|film critics]] who praised Peter Medak's willingness to revisit a dark period both professionally and personally. The wider film community has taken the film under its wings as a rare insight to what happens when a [[Filmmaking|film production]] unravels. The documentary spent 2019 travelling to [[Film festival|film festivals]] around the world, picking up numerous [[Award|awards]], winning both The Golden Palm ''(best film competing in all categories)'' and Best Documentary at The [[Beverly Hills Film Festival]] in April 2019.  \n\n== Plot ==\nIn September 1973, Peter Sellers embarked on the production of a 17th Century pirate comedy in [[Cyprus]] for Columbia Pictures. What followed was a game of cat and mouse between Sellers, the young Director, [[Peter Medak]], cast, crew and movie executives as Sellers set about trying to shut down the film. The ill-fated production found Sellers in a personal and professional void. The recent collapse of his relationship with [[Liza Minnelli]] and a number of poorly received films spun him into a dark period, giving rise to a roller coaster of incidents during production, from sabotage to mutiny, from agonizing shooting schedules in 40 degrees to [[Spike Milligan]]\u2019s frantic on set re-writes. The film was somehow completed but rejected by Columbia and never theatrically released.\n\nAt its core lies a story of the insanity of the film but also the story of a young acclaimed Director firmly on a path to greatness. Peter Medak had made 3 back-to-back successes, most notably \u2018[[The Ruling Class (film)|The Ruling Class]]\u2019 in \u201872 with [[Peter O'Toole|Peter O\u2019 Toole]] (nominated both for the [[Palme d'Or|Palm D\u2019Or]] and an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]) but this film had a significant affect on his career.\n\nAfter 42 years the wounds have barely heeled for Medak and this documentary is his opportunity to tell the story of what happened on that film and finally release the weight associated with its failure.\n\nThe documentary\u2019s parallel theme is the inner workings of the movie business and the lunacy of a production when it unravels and how the bankability of an actor can be the catalyst for a project but also its nemesis.\n\n''The Ghost of Peter Sellers'' is a comic-tragic feature doc about what it takes to be a film director and survive your biggest disaster.\n\n== Reception ==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating]] of 100%<ref>{{Citation|title=The Ghost of Peter Sellers (2018)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_ghost_of_peter_sellers|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>.

The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}</ref>\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

In Judaism, the Messiah is not considered to be [[God]] or a pre-existent divine [[Son of God]]. He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David. That is why he is referred to as [[Messiah ben David]], which means \"Messiah, son of David\". The messiah, in Judaism, is considered to be a great, charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|publisher=Jewfaq.org|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> He will be the one who will not \"judge by what his eyes see\" or \"decide by what his ears hear\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|Isaiah|11:3-4|HE}}</ref>\n\nBelief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism, and is one of [[Maimonides]]' [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|13 Principles of Faith]].<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm |title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah |publisher=Jewfaq.org |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMaimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms:\n{{quote|And if a king shall arise from among the House of David, studying Torah and occupied with commandments like his father David, according to the written and oral Torah, and he will impel all of Israel to follow it and to strengthen breaches in its observance, and will fight God's wars, this one is to be treated as if he were the anointed one. If he succeeded and built the Holy Temple in its proper place and gathered the dispersed ones of Israel together, this is indeed the anointed one for certain, and he will mend the entire world to worship the Lord together, as it is stated: \"For then I shall turn for the nations a clear tongue, so that they will all proclaim the Name of the Lord, and to worship Him with a united resolve (Zephaniah 3:9).\"<ref>Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings 11:4</ref>}}\n\nEven though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism, trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon. These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion. So in Judaism, there is no specific time when the messiah comes. Rather, it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes. It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most (when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah) or deserves it the most (when genuine goodness prevails in the world).<ref name=\"Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah\"/>\n\nA common modern [[rabbinic literature|rabbinic]] interpretation is that there is a ''potential'' messiah in every generation. The [[Talmud]], which often uses stories to make a moral point (''aggadah''), tells of a highly respected [[rabbi]] who found the Messiah at the gates of [[Rome]] and asked him, \"When will you finally come?\" He was quite surprised when he was told, \"Today.\" Overjoyed and full of anticipation, the man waited all day. The next day he returned, disappointed and puzzled, and asked, \"You said messiah would come 'today' but he didn't come! What happened?\" The Messiah replied, \"Scripture says, 'Today, if you will but hearken to his voice.'\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|Psalms|95:7|HE}}</ref>\n\nA [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace, Messiah ben David, will be preceded by [[Messiah ben Joseph]], who will gather the children of Israel around him, lead them to Jerusalem. After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem, Messiah ben Joseph, will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion. Then [[Armilus]], according to one group of sources, or [[Gog and Magog]], according to the other, will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem, wage war against Messiah ben Joseph, and slay him. His corpse, according to one group, will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem; according to the other, it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs, until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Messiah |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10729-messiah |year=1906 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Chabad ===\n{{further information|Chabad messianism|Chabad-Lubavitch related controversies|List of Jewish messiah claimants}}\n[[File:Psak din messiah.jpg|thumb|right|Chabad Halachic ruling declaring \"every single Jew\" had to believe in the imminent second coming of the deceased 7th Lubavitcher Rebbe as the Messiah<ref name=\"DVED-250\"/>]]\n\n[[Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn]] (r. 1920 - 1950), sixth ''[[Rebbe]]'' (spiritual leader) of Chabad Lubavitch,<ref name=\"LubavitcherFalseMessiahs\"/><ref name=\"MS-HabadMinuth\"/> and Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902 - 1994), seventh ''Rebbe'' of Chabad,<ref name=\"SHandelman\">Susan Handelman, [http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/177352/lubavitcher-rebbe#undefined The Lubavitcher Rebbe Died 20 Years Ago Today.

[[Sunlight]] provides the [[energy]] that [[green plants]] use to create [[sugars]] mostly in the form of [[starch]]es, which release energy into the living things that digest them. This process of [[photosynthesis]] provides virtually all the energy used by living things. Historically, another important source of light for humans has been [[fire]], from ancient campfires to modern [[kerosene lamp]]s. With the development of [[electric light]]s and [[history of electric power transmission|power systems]], electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[fireflies]] use light to locate mates, and [[vampire squid]]s use it to hide themselves from prey.\n\nThe primary properties of visible light are [[intensity (physics)|intensity]], propagation direction, frequency or wavelength [[spectrum]], and [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], while its [[speed of light|speed in a vacuum]], 299,792,458 meters per second, is one of the fundamental [[Mathematical constant|constants]] of nature.

Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\n\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite book |last=Laufer |first=Gabriel |title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |journal=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=13 July 1996 |isbn=978-0-521-45233-5 |page=11|bibcode=1996iole.book.....L }}</ref><ref name=\"Bradt2004\">{{cite book |last=Bradt |first=Hale |title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&pg=PA26 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53551-9 |page=26}}</ref> to as broadly as 380\u2013800&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"OhannesianStreeter2001\">{{cite book |last1=Ohannesian |first1=Lena |last2=Streeter |first2=Anthony |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&pg=PA187 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=9 November 2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5 |page=187}}</ref><ref name=\"AhluwaliaGoyal2000\">{{cite book |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=V.K. |last2=Goyal |first2=Madhuri |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJNJnn0M75MC&pg=PA110 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=1 January 2000 |publisher=Narosa |isbn=978-81-7319-159-6 |page=110}}</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1050&nbsp;nm;<ref name=\"Sliney1976\">{{cite journal |last1=Sliney |first1=David H. |last2=Wangemann |first2=Robert T. |last3=Franks |first3=James K. |last4=Wolbarsht |first4=Myron L. |year=1976 |title=Visual sensitivity of the eye to infrared laser radiation |journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=339\u2013341 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000339 |pmid=1262982 |quote=The foveal sensitivity to several near-infrared laser wavelengths was measured.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R. W |last2=MacKay |first2=R. J |doi-access=free }}</ref> However, its size was not known at that time. If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=A.A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}</ref>\n\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=24 January 2001 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid (the water, in this case) from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[Index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[welder]]'s torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hong Kong]] illuminated by colorful artificial [[lighting]].]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity.

The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back.

[[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]].

Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Electromagnetic radiation in or near visible spectrum}}\n{{Redirect|Visible light|light that cannot be seen with human eye|Electromagnetic radiation|other uses|Light (disambiguation)|and|Visible light (disambiguation)}}\n{{Pp|small=yes}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n[[File:Light dispersion conceptual waves.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|A triangular [[dispersive prism|prism]] [[dispersion (optics)|dispersing]] a beam of white light.

Like all types of EM radiation, visible light propagates as waves. However, the energy imparted by the waves is absorbed at single locations the way particles are absorbed. The absorbed energy of the EM waves is called a photon, and represents the [[quantum|quanta]] of light. When a wave of light is transformed and absorbed as a photon, the energy of the wave instantly collapses to a single location, and this location is where the photon \"arrives.\" This is what is called the [[wave function collapse]]. This dual wave-like and particle-like nature of light is known as the [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. The study of light, known as [[optics]], is an important research area in modern physics.\n\n==Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light==\n[[File:EM spectrum.svg|thumb|380px|The [[electromagnetic spectrum]], with the [[visible spectrum|visible portion]] highlighted]]\n{{Main|Electromagnetic spectrum}}\n\nGenerally, EM radiation (the designation \"radiation\" excludes static electric, magnetic, and [[near and far field|near fields]]), or EMR, is classified by wavelength into [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], the [[visible spectrum]] that we perceive as light, [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.\n\nThe behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.  When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries.\n\nEMR in the visible light region consists of [[quantum|quanta]] (called [[photon]]s) that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the visual molecule [[retinal]] in the human retina, which change triggers the sensation of vision.\n\nThere exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. [[Infrared sensing in snakes]] depends on a kind of natural [[thermal imaging]], in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, which is how these animals detect it.\n\nAbove the range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below 360 [[nanometer|nm]] and the internal lens below 400&nbsp;nm. Furthermore, the [[rod cell|rods]] and [[cone cell|cones]] located in the [[retina]] of the human eye cannot detect the very short (below 360&nbsp;nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light.\n\nVarious sources define visible light as narrowly as 420\u2013680&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite book |last=Laufer |first=Gabriel |title=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |journal=Introduction to Optics and Lasers in Engineering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MxLPYMS5TUC&pg=PA11 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=13 July 1996 |isbn=978-0-521-45233-5 |page=11|bibcode=1996iole.book.....L }}</ref><ref name=\"Bradt2004\">{{cite book |last=Bradt |first=Hale |title=Astronomy Methods: A Physical Approach to Astronomical Observations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp7vyaGvhLMC&pg=PA26 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-53551-9 |page=26}}</ref> to as broadly as 380\u2013800&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"OhannesianStreeter2001\">{{cite book |last1=Ohannesian |first1=Lena |last2=Streeter |first2=Anthony |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Analysis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DwPb4wgqseYC&pg=PA187 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=9 November 2001 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8247-4194-5 |page=187}}</ref><ref name=\"AhluwaliaGoyal2000\">{{cite book |last1=Ahluwalia |first1=V.K. |last2=Goyal |first2=Madhuri |title=A Textbook of Organic Chemistry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tJNJnn0M75MC&pg=PA110 |accessdate=20 October 2013 |date=1 January 2000 |publisher=Narosa |isbn=978-81-7319-159-6 |page=110}}</ref> Under ideal laboratory conditions, people can see infrared up to at least 1050&nbsp;nm;<ref name=\"Sliney1976\">{{cite journal |last1=Sliney |first1=David H. |last2=Wangemann |first2=Robert T. |last3=Franks |first3=James K. |last4=Wolbarsht |first4=Myron L. |year=1976 |title=Visual sensitivity of the eye to infrared laser radiation |journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America]] |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=339\u2013341 |doi=10.1364/JOSA.66.000339 |pmid=1262982 |quote=The foveal sensitivity to several near-infrared laser wavelengths was measured.

The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the meter is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.\n\nDifferent [[physicist]]s have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], a Danish physicist, in 1676. Using a [[telescope]], R\u00f8mer observed the motions of [[Jupiter]] and one of its [[natural satellite|moons]], [[Io (moon)|Io]]. Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.ss/1009212817 |title=Scientific Method, Statistical Method and the Speed of Light |journal=Statistical Science |year=2000 |volume=15 |pages=254\u2013278 |issue=3 |doi=10.1214/ss/1009212817 |mr=1847825|last1=Oldford |first1=R.

If R\u00f8mer had known the diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of 227,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\nAnother more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] in 1849. Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [[cog wheel]] was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin.  Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as 313,000,000&nbsp;m/s.\n\n[[L\u00e9on Foucault]] carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of 298,000,000&nbsp;m/s in 1862. [[Albert A. Michelson]] conducted experiments on the speed of light from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in 1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] to [[Mount San Antonio]] in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of 299,796,000&nbsp;m/s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Michelson |first=A.A. |title=Measurements of the velocity of light between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=January 1927 |volume=65 |pages=1 |doi=10.1086/143021 |bibcode=1927ApJ....65....1M}}</ref>\n\nThe effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary [[matter]], is less than in vacuum. For example, the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.\n\nTwo independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] of the element [[rubidium]], one team at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Rowland Institute for Science]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the other at the [[Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], also in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Researchers now able to stop, restart light |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=24 January 2001 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028041346/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/01.24/01-stoplight.html |archivedate=28 October 2011 }}</ref> However, the popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\" it had ceased to be light.\n\n==Optics==\n{{Main|Optics}}\n\nThe study of light and the interaction of light and [[matter]] is termed [[optics]]. The observation and study of [[optical phenomena]] such as [[rainbow]]s and the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora borealis]] offer many clues as to the nature of light.\n\n===Refraction===\n{{Main|Refraction}}\n[[File:Refraction-with-soda-straw.jpg|thumb|250 px|An example of refraction of light. The straw appears bent, because of refraction of light as it enters liquid (the water, in this case) from air.]]\n[[File:Cloud in the sunlight.jpg|thumb|250px|A cloud illuminated by sunlight]]\n\nRefraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another. It is described by [[Snell's Law]]:\n\n:<math>n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\ .</math>\n\nwhere \u03b8<sub>1</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in the first medium, \u03b8<sub>2</sub> is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium, and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the [[Index of refraction|indices of refraction]], ''n'' = 1 in a [[vacuum]] and ''n'' > 1 in a [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]] [[Chemical substance|substance]].\n\nWhen a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is not [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This change of direction is known as [[refraction]].\n\nThe refractive quality of [[lens (optics)|lenses]] is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images. [[Magnifying glass]]es, [[Glasses|spectacles]], [[contact lens]]es, [[microscope]]s and [[refracting telescope]]s are all examples of this manipulation.\n\n==Light sources== <!-- This section is linked from [[Source]] -->\n{{Redirect|Lightsource|the solar energy developer named Lightsource|Lightsource Renewable Energy}}\n{{Further|List of light sources}}\nThere are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of [[black-body]] radiation. A simple thermal source is sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [[chromosphere]] of the [[Sun]] at around  {{convert|6000|K|C F|abbr=off}} peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thulescientific.com/LYNCH%20&%20Soffer%20OPN%201999.pdf |title=Spectrum and the Color Sensitivity of the Eye |website=Thulescientific.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref> and roughly 44% of sunlight energy that reaches the ground is visible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/ |title=Reference Solar Spectral Irradiance: Air Mass 1.5 |accessdate=12 November 2009}}</ref> Another example is [[incandescent light bulb]]s, which emit only around 10% of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in [[fire|flames]], but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared, and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.\n\nThe peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about 10 [[micrometre]] wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one, and finally a blue-white color as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colors can be seen when metal is heated to \"red hot\" or \"white hot\". Blue-white [[thermal emission]] is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue color in a [[natural gas|gas]] flame or a [[welder]]'s torch is in fact due to molecular emission, notably by CH radicals (emitting a wavelength band around 425&nbsp;nm, and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).\n\nAtoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces \"[[emission line]]s\" in the spectrum of each atom. [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|Emission]] can be [[spontaneous emission|spontaneous]], as in [[light-emitting diode]]s, [[gas discharge]] lamps (such as [[neon lamp]]s and [[neon sign]]s, [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s, etc.), and flames (light from the hot gas itself\u2014so, for example, [[sodium]] in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light). Emission can also be [[stimulated emission|stimulated]], as in a [[laser]] or a microwave [[maser]].\n\nDeceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [[electron]], can produce visible radiation: [[cyclotron radiation]], [[synchrotron radiation]], and [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation are all examples of this. Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible [[Cherenkov radiation]]. Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by [[chemoluminescence]]. In living things, this process is called [[bioluminescence]]. For example, [[firefly|fireflies]] produce light by this means, and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.\n\nCertain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation, a process known as [[fluorescence]]. Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation. This is known as [[phosphorescence]]. Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles. [[Cathodoluminescence]] is one example. This mechanism is used in [[cathode ray tube]] [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s.\n\n[[File:Colorful artificial lighting at night.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Hong Kong]] illuminated by colorful artificial [[lighting]].]]\n\nCertain other mechanisms can produce light:\n* [[Bioluminescence]]\n* [[Cherenkov radiation]]\n* [[Electroluminescence]]\n* [[Scintillation (physics)|Scintillation]]\n* [[Sonoluminescence]]\n* [[Triboluminescence]]\n\nWhen the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:\n* Particle\u2013[[antiparticle]] annihilation\n* [[Radioactive decay]]\n\n==Units and measures==\n{{Main|Photometry (optics)|Radiometry}}\n\nLight is measured with two main alternative sets of units: [[radiometry]] consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths, while [[photometry (optics)|photometry]] measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception.  Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify [[Illumination (lighting)]] intended for human use.  The SI units for both systems are summarized in the following tables.\n\n{{SI radiometry units|1|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n{{SI light units|2|self|nb}}<!-- parameter 1 for table number, parameter 2 for compare destination page, parameter 3 for reference group -->\n\nThe photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The [[cone cell]]s in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum, and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around 555&nbsp;nm. Therefore, two sources of light which produce the same intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to take this into account, and therefore are a better representation of how \"bright\" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw [[power (physics)|power]] by a quantity called [[luminous efficacy]], and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination measured by a [[photocell]] sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye, and without filters which may be costly, photocells and [[charge-coupled device]]s (CCD) tend to respond to some [[infrared]], [[ultraviolet]] or both.\n\n==Light pressure==\n{{Main|Radiation pressure}}\nLight exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell's equations, but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by ''[[speed of light|c]]'', the speed of light.{{Spaces}} Due to the magnitude of ''c'', the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.{{Spaces}} For example, a one-milliwatt [[laser pointer]] exerts a force of about 3.3 [[newton (unit)|piconewtons]] on the object being illuminated; thus, one could lift a [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]] with laser pointers, but doing so would require about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tang |first=Hong |title=May The Force of Light Be With You |journal=IEEE Spectrum |date=1 October 2009 |volume=46 |issue=10 |pages=46\u201351 |doi=10.1109/MSPEC.2009.5268000}}</ref>{{Spaces}} However, in [[nanometre]]-scale applications such as [[nanoelectromechanical systems]] (|NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant, and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research.<ref>See, for example, [http://www.eng.yale.edu/tanglab/research.htm nano-opto-mechanical systems research at Yale University].</ref> At larger scales, light pressure can cause [[asteroid]]s to spin faster,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2004/feb/asteroids-get-spun-by-the-sun/ |title=Asteroids Get Spun By the Sun |author=Kathy A. |website=Discover Magazine |date=5 February 2004}}</ref> acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a [[windmill]].{{Spaces}} The possibility of making [[solar sail]]s that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html |title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space |website=NASA |date=31 August 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2004/04-208.html |title=NASA team successfully deploys two solar sail systems |website=NASA |date=9 August 2004}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the motion of the [[Crookes radiometer]] was originally attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum.<ref>P.

He wrote, \"radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface. The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief.\"\n\nUsually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.

The [[atomism|atomicity]] of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous.<ref name=\"sifuae.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sifuae.com/sif/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Shastra-Pratibha-2015-Seniors-Booklet.pdf |title=Shastra Pratibha 2015 Seniors Booklet |website=Sifuae.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}</ref>\nOn the other hand, the Vaisheshika school gives an [[atomic theory]] of the physical world on the non-atomic ground of [[Aether (classical element)|ether]], space and time. (See ''[[Atomism#Indian atomism|Indian atomism]]''.) The basic atoms are those of earth (''prthivi''), water (''pani''), fire (''agni''), and air (''vayu'') Light rays are taken to be a stream of high velocity of ''tejas'' (fire) atoms. The particles of light can exhibit different characteristics depending on the speed and the arrangements of the ''tejas'' atoms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\nThe ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' refers to sunlight as \"the seven rays of the sun\".<ref name=\"sifuae.com\"/>\n\nThe Indian [[Buddhist]]s, such as [[Dign\u0101ga]] in the 5th century and [[Dharmakirti]] in the 7th century, developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.<ref name=\"sifuae.com\"/>\n\n===Descartes===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) held that light was a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical]] property of the luminous body, rejecting the \"forms\" of [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]] and [[Witelo]] as well as the \"species\" of [[Roger Bacon#Legacy|Bacon]], [[Grosseteste]], and [[Kepler]].<ref name=\"Theoriesof\">''Theories of light, from Descartes to Newton'' A.I. Sabra CUP Archive,1981 p. 48 {{ISBN|0-521-28436-8|978-0-521-28436-3}}</ref> In 1637 he published a theory of the [[refraction]] of light that assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media.\n\nDescartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes' theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.<ref name=\"Theoriesof\" />\n\n===Particle theory===\n{{Main|Corpuscular theory of light}}\n[[File:PierreGassendi.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Pierre Gassendi]].]]\n[[Pierre Gassendi]] (1592\u20131655), an atomist, proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s.  [[Isaac Newton]] studied Gassendi's work at an early age, and preferred his view to Descartes' theory of the ''plenum''. He stated in his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675 that light was composed of [[Corpuscularianism|corpuscles]] (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the [[diffraction]] of light (which had been observed by [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]]) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\nNewton's theory could be used to predict the [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light, but could only explain [[refraction]] by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser [[Medium (optics)|medium]] because the [[gravity|gravitational]] pull was greater. Newton published the final version of his theory in his ''[[Opticks]]'' of 1704. His reputation helped the [[particle theory of light]] to hold sway during the 18th century. The particle theory of light led [[Laplace]] to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [[black hole]]. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A translation of Newton's essay on light appears in ''The large scale structure of space-time'', by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis]].\n\nThe fact that light could be [[polarized light|polarized]] was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory. [[\u00c9tienne-Louis Malus]] in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory of polarization. [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] in 1812 showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory.\n\n=== Wave theory ===\nTo explain the origin of [[color]]s, [[Robert Hooke]] (1635\u20131703) developed a \"pulse theory\" and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his 1665 work ''[[Micrographia]]'' (\"Observation IX\"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be [[perpendicular]] to the direction of propagation. [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in 1678, and published it in his ''[[Treatise on light]]'' in 1690. He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the ''[[Luminiferous ether]]''.  As waves are not affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium.<ref>Fokko Jan Dijksterhuis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cPFevyomPUIC Lenses and Waves: Christiaan Huygens and the Mathematical Science of Optics in the 17th Century], Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|1-4020-2697-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|200 px|[[Christiaan Huygens]].]]\n\n[[File:Young Diffraction.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s sketch of a [[double-slit experiment]] showing [[diffraction]]. Young's experiments supported the theory that light consists of waves.]]\n\nThe wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]). Young showed by means of a [[double-slit experiment|diffraction experiment]] that light behaved as waves. He also proposed that different [[color]]s were caused by different [[wavelength]]s of light, and explained color vision in terms of three-colored receptors in the eye. Another supporter of the wave theory was [[Leonhard Euler]]. He argued in ''Nova theoria lucis et colorum'' (1746) that [[diffraction]] could more easily be explained by a wave theory. In 1816 [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]] gave [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a [[transverse wave]].<ref>James R. Hofmann, ''Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re: Enlightenment and Electrodynamics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 222.</ref>\n\nLater, Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light, and presented it to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]] in 1817. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] added to Fresnel's mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory, helping to overturn Newton's corpuscular theory.{{dubious|date=June 2018}}<!-- [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson]] says he was an opponent of the theory --> By the year 1821, Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves, would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical substance ''luminiferous aether'' proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]].\n\nNewton's corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite. At that time, the [[speed of light]] could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [[L\u00e9on Foucault]], in 1850.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Understanding Physics |author1=David Cassidy |author2=Gerald Holton |author3=James Rutherford |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=rpQo7f9F1xUC&pg=PA382}}</ref> His result supported the wave theory, and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned, only to partly re-emerge in the 20th century.\n\n===Electromagnetic theory===\n{{Main|Electromagnetic radiation}}\n[[File:light-wave.svg|360px|thumb|A 3\u2013dimensional rendering of [[Polarization (waves)|linearly polarized]] light wave frozen in time and showing the two oscillating components of light; an [[electric field]] and a [[magnetic field]] perpendicular to each other and to the direction of motion (a [[transverse wave]]).]]\n\nIn 1845, [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the [[magnetic field]] direction in the presence of a transparent [[dielectric]], an effect now known as [[Faraday rotation]].<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\">{{cite book |last=Longair |first=Malcolm |title=Theoretical Concepts in Physics |year=2003 |page=87}}</ref> This was the first evidence that light was related to [[electromagnetism]]. In 1846 he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines.<ref name=\"LongairMalcolm\" /> Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Physics|last=Cassidy|first=D|publisher=Springer Verlag New York|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nFaraday's work inspired [[James Clerk Maxwell]] to study electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in ''On Physical Lines of Force''. In 1873, he published ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'', which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still known as [[Maxwell's equations]]. Soon after, [[Heinrich Hertz]] confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory, and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference. Maxwell's theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging, and wireless communications.\n\nIn the quantum theory, photons are seen as [[wave packet]]s of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's classical theory could not (such as [[spectral line]]s).\n\n===Quantum theory===\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]], attempting to explain [[black-body radiation]] suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency. Planck called these \"lumps\" of light energy \"[[quantum|quanta]]\" (from a Latin word for \"how much\"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], and suggested that these light quanta had a \"real\" existence. In 1923 [[Arthur Holly Compton]] showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays scattered from electrons (so called [[Compton scattering]]) could be explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In 1926 [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] named these light quanta particles [[photon]]s.<ref>{{Open access}} {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/IntroductionToMolecularSpectroscopy |title=Introduction to Molecular Spectroscopy |last=Barrow |first=Gordon M. |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1962 |format=Scanned PDF |lccn=62-12478}}</ref>\n\nEventually the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] came to picture light as (in some sense) ''both'' a particle and a wave, and (in another sense), as a phenomenon which is ''neither'' a particle nor a wave (which actually are macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead, modern physics sees light as something that can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles), and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (water waves), but is actually something that cannot be fully imagined. As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.\n\nIn February 2018, scientists reported, for the first time, the discovery of a new form of light, which may involve [[polariton]]s, that could be useful in the development of [[quantum computer]]s.<ref name=\"NW-20180216\">{{cite web |last=Hignett |first=Katherine |title=Physics Creates New Form of Light That Could Drive The Quantum Computing Revolution |url=http://www.newsweek.com/photons-light-physics-808862 |date=16 February 2018 |website=Newsweek |accessdate=17 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"SCI-20180216\">{{cite journal |author=Liang, Qi-Yu|display-authors=etal|title=Observation of three-photon bound states in a quantum nonlinear medium |date=16 February 2018 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=359 |issue=6377 |pages=783\u2013786 |doi=10.1126/science.aao7293 |pmid=29449489 |pmc=6467536|arxiv=1709.01478 |bibcode=2018Sci...359..783L }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Physics|Science}}\n{{div col|colwidth=13em}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Ballistic photon]]\n* [[Black-body radiation]]\n* [[Color temperature]]\n* [[Fermat's principle]]\n* [[Huygens' principle]]\n* [[Incandescent light bulb]]\n* [[International Commission on Illumination]]\n* ''[[Journal of Luminescence]]''\n* [[Light art]]\n* [[Light beam]] \u2013 in particular about light beams visible from the side\n* [[Light Fantastic (TV series)]]\n* [[Light mill]]\n* [[Light painting]]\n* [[Light pollution]]\n* [[Light therapy]]\n* [[Lighting]]\n* [[List of light sources]]\n* ''[[Luminescence: The Journal of Biological and Chemical Luminescence]]''\n* [[Photic sneeze reflex]]\n* [[Photometry (optics)|Photometry]]\n* [[Photon]]\n* [[Right to light]]\n* [[Risks and benefits of sun exposure]]\n* [[Spectroscopy]]\n* [[Visible spectrum]]\n* [[Wave\u2013particle duality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons-inline|Light}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n* {{Wikiquote-inline}}\n* {{Britannica|340440|Light (physics)}}\n* {{LEDV|27859}}\n{{Radiation}}\n{{Color topics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Light| ]]\n[[Category:Radiation]]\n", "name_user": "Oxalus", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLight pressure:rogue punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light"}
