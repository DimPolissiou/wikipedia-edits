His maternal great-grandfather was African-born general [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]]. He published his first poem at the age of 15, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the [[Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum]]. Upon graduation from the Lycee, Pushkin recited his controversial poem \"[[Ode to Liberty (poem)|Ode to Liberty]]\", one of several that led to his exile by [[Emperor of All Russia|Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]]. While under the strict surveillance of the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Tsar's political police]] and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]''.

Abram wrote in a letter to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, that Gannibal was from the town of \"Lagon\".

He became acquainted with the Russian language through not interesting but cyka with household serfs and his nanny, Arina Rodionovna, whom he loved dearly and was more attached to than to his own mother. He published his first poem at 15. When he finished school, as part of the first graduating class of the prestigious [[Imperial Lyceum]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], near [[Saint Petersburg]], his talent was already widely recognized on the Russian literary scene. After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820, he published his first long poem, ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', with much controversy about its subject and Xyi.\n\n==Social activism==\nWhile at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian [[liberalism|liberal]] individualist teachings of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem ''19 October''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schapiro |first1=Leonard |title=Rationalism and Nationalism in Russian Nineteenth Century Political Thought |date=1967 |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=48\u201350 |quote=Schapiro writes that Kunitsyn\u2019s influence on Pushkin\u2019s political views was 'important above all.' Schapiro describes Kunitsyn's philosophy as conveying 'the most enlightened principles of past thought on the relations of the individual and the state,' namely, that the ruler\u2019s power is 'limited by the natural rights of his subjects, and these subjects can never be treated as a means to an end but only as an end in themselves.'}}</ref> Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, particularly [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], whom he described as \"the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Andrew |title=Pushkin's Lyric Intelligence |date=2008 |publisher=OUP Oxford |page=283}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pushkin |first1=Alexander |title=The Letters of Alexander Pushkin |date=1967 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=164}}</ref>\n\nPushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals.

However, because insurgents in the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist Uprising]] (1825) in Saint Petersburg had kept some of Pushkin's earlier political poems the tsar retained strict control of everything Pushkin published and he was unable to travel at will.\n\nDuring that same year (1825), Pushkin also wrote what would become his most famous play, the drama ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]'', while at his mother's estate. He could not however, gain permission to publish it until five years later.

After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of [[cholera]] and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the [[Great Ascension Church]] on [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street]] in Moscow. When the [[Tsar]] gave Pushkin the lowest court title; Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could properly attend court balls.<ref name=\"russiapedia.rt.com\"/>\n\n[[File:D'Anth\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]]\nIn the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other great early writers, [[Nikolai Gogol]]. After reading Gogol's 1831\u20131832 volume of short stories ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'', Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine ''[[Sovremennik|The Contemporary]]'', which he founded in 1836.\n\n==Death==\nBy the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November he sent a challenge to a duel to [[Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth\u00e8s|Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]], also known as Dantes-Gekkern. [[Jacob van Heeckeren tot Enghuizen|Jacob van Heeckeren]], d'Anth\u00e8s' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled. On 17 November d'Anth\u00e8s made a proposal to Natalia Goncharova's (Pushkina's) sister \u2013 Ekaterina Goncharova. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. Georges d'Anth\u00e8s continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public, and rumours that d'Anth\u00e8s had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation circulated. On 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) of 1837 Pushkin sent a \"highly insulting letter\" to Heeckeren. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anth\u00e8s, on the same day through the attach\u00e9 of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac. \n\nPushkin asked [[Arthur Magenis]], then attach\u00e9 to the [[Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Saint Petersburg|British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg]], to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept, but on 26 January (7 February), but approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however, d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning, declining to be his second as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.<ref name=\"simmons\">{{cite news |last1=Simmons |first1=Ernest J. |title=Pushkin |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126492/page/n435/mode/2up/search/magenis |accessdate=28 January 2020 |date=1922|ref=Simmons |page=412}}</ref><ref name=\"binyon\">{{cite book |last1=Binyon |first1=T.

The funeral service was initially assigned to the St. Isaac's Cathedral, but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral, the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province.

Pushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle ''[[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', including \"[[The Shot (Pushkin)|The Shot]]\", were well received. Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.\n\n''Onegin'' is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator [[Vladimir Nabokov]] needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers.

[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s operas ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (1879) and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (La Dame de Pique, 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.\n\n[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s monumental ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (two versions, 1868\u20139 and 1871\u20132) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.\nOther Russian operas based on Pushkin include [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Dargomyzhsky]]'s ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]''; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'', and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]]'s ''[[Prisoner of the Caucasus (opera)|Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', ''[[Feast in Time of Plague (opera)|Feast in Time of Plague]]'', and ''[[The Captain's Daughter (opera)|The Captain's Daughter]]''; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]''; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s one-act operas ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'' (based on ''The Gypsies'') and ''[[The Miserly Knight]]''; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'', and [[Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk|N\u00e1pravn\u00edk]]'s ''[[Dubrovsky (opera)|Dubrovsky]]''.\n\nAdditionally, ballets and [[cantata]]s, as well as innumerable [[Art song|songs]], have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in [[Isabelle Aboulker]]'s [[song cycle]] \"[[Troika (album)|Caprice \u00e9trange]]\"). [[Franz von Supp\u00e9|Supp\u00e9]], [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]] and [[Gian Francesco Malipiero|Malipiero]] have also based operas on his works.<ref>Taruskin R. Pushkin in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera''. London & New York, Macmillan, 1997.</ref>\n\n''The Desire of Glory'', which has been dedicated to Elizaveta Vorontsova, was set to music by [[David Tukhmanov]] {{YouTube|pRWJ1V0rgB4|(Vitold Petrovsky \u2013 The Desire of Glory}}), as well as ''Keep Me, Mine Talisman'' \u2013 by [[Alexander Barykin]] {{YouTube|rrlHaXYKzFo|(Alexander Barykin \u2013 Keep Me, Mine Talisman}}) and later by Tukhmanov.\n\n===Romanticism===\nPushkin is considered by many to be the central representative of Romanticism in Russian literature although he was not unequivocally known as a Romantic. Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from [[Neoclassicism]] through Romanticism to [[Literary realism|Realism]]. An alternative assessment suggests that \"he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic\" and that \"he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic\".<ref name=basker/>\n\n===Russian language===\nAccording to [[Vladimir Nabokov]], <blockquote>Pushkin's [[idiom]] combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]], [[Konstantin Batyushkov|Batyushkov]], [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]] and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]]:\n\n# The poetical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] strain that still lived in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] forms and locutions\n# Abundant and natural [[gallicism]]s\n# Everyday [[colloquialism]]s of his set\n# Stylized popular speech by making a salad of the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists and adding the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of [[parody]].<ref>[[Vladimir Nabokov]], ''Verses and Versions'', p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised [[calque]]s. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.\n\nHis work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the ''Sovremennik'' (''The Contemporary'', or ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a''). Pushkin inspired the [[Russian fairy tale|folk tales]] and genre pieces of other authors: [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Sergei Yesenin|Yesenin]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Pushkin was analysed by [[Nikolai Gogol]], his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. The last mentioned also produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\n\n==Honours==\n*In 1929, Soviet writer, Leonid Grossman, published a novel, ''The d'Archiac Papers'', telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the [[Tsar]]ist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title ''Death of the Poet''.\n*In 1937, the town of [[Pushkin, Saint Petersburg|Tsarskoye Selo]] was renamed Pushkin in his honour.\n*There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve|large complex]] in Mikhaylovskoye.\n*Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film ''Pushkin: The Last Duel''. The film was directed by [[Natalya Bondarchuk]]. Pushkin was portrayed on screen by [[Sergei Bezrukov]].\n*The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the [[Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn|Duchess of Abercorn]] to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences.\n*A minor planet, [[2208 Pushkin]], discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Chernykh]], is named after him.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Schmadel| first = Lutz D.| title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names| page = 179| edition = 5th | year = 2003| publisher=Springer Verlag| location = New York| url = https://books.google.com/books?q=2208+Pushkin+QU3| isbn = 3-540-00238-3}}</ref> A [[List of craters on Mercury|crater on Mercury]] is also named in his honour.\n* [[MS Marco Polo#Service as Aleksandr Pushkin|MS ''Aleksandr Pushkin'']], second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \"poet\" or \"writer\" class).\n* A [[Pushkin (Tashkent Metro)|station of Tashkent metro]] was named in his honour.\n* The Pushkin Hills<ref name=\"CGNDBHills\">{{cite cgndb|id= FCIXD|title= Pushkin Hills|accessdate= 25 May 2014}}</ref> and Pushkin Lake<ref name=\"CGNDBLake\">{{cite cgndb|id= FCIXE|title= Pushkin Lake|accessdate= 25 May 2014}}</ref> were named in his honour in [[Ben Nevis Township]], [[Cochrane District]], in Ontario, Canada.\n* [[UN Russian Language Day]], established by the United Nations in 2010 and celebrated each year on 6 June, was scheduled to coincide with Pushkin's birthday.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wagner|first=Ashley|title=Celebrating Russian Language Day|url=http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2013/06/russian-language-day/|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=Oxford Dictionaries|date=6 June 2013}}</ref>\n* A statue of Pushkin was unveiled inside the [[Mehan Garden]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] to commemorate the [[Philippines\u2013Russia relations]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite sign|title=Alexander Pushkin (1799\u20131837) |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:AlexanderPushkinMonumentjf4497_02.JPG |location=Plaque on the pedestal of Pushkin's statue at the Mehan Garden, Manila |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927225601/https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AAlexanderPushkinMonumentjf4497_02.JPG |archivedate=27 September 2015 }}</ref>\n* The [[Alexander Pushkin (diamond)|Alexander Pushkin diamond]], the second largest found in Russia and the former territory of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], was named after him.\n* On 28 November 2009, a Pushkin Monument was erected in [[Asmara]], capital of [[Eritrea]].<ref>{{cite news|script-title=ru:\u0412 \u042d\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043c\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443|url=http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=327939|work=Vesti|date=26 November 2009|accessdate=23 April 2017|language=ru}}</ref>\n* In 2005 a monument to Pushkin and his grandmother [[:ru:\u0413\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b, \u041e\u0441\u0438\u043f \u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|Maria Hannibal]] was commissioned by an enthusiast of Russian culture Just Rugel in Zakharovo, Russia.

After school, Pushkin plunged into the vibrant and raucous intellectual youth culture of the capital, Saint Petersburg. In 1820, he published his first long poem, ''[[Ruslan and Ludmila]]'', with much controversy about its subject and style.\n\n==Social activism==\nWhile at the Lyceum, Pushkin was heavily influenced by the Kantian [[liberalism|liberal]] individualist teachings of Alexander Petrovich Kunitsyn, whom Pushkin would later commemorate in his poem ''19 October''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schapiro |first1=Leonard |title=Rationalism and Nationalism in Russian Nineteenth Century Political Thought |date=1967 |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=48\u201350 |quote=Schapiro writes that Kunitsyn\u2019s influence on Pushkin\u2019s political views was 'important above all.' Schapiro describes Kunitsyn's philosophy as conveying 'the most enlightened principles of past thought on the relations of the individual and the state,' namely, that the ruler\u2019s power is 'limited by the natural rights of his subjects, and these subjects can never be treated as a means to an end but only as an end in themselves.'}}</ref> Pushkin also immersed himself in the thought of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], to which he would remain permanently indebted throughout his life, particularly [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], whom he described as \"the first to follow the new road, and to bring the lamp of philosophy into the dark archives of history\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Andrew |title=Pushkin's Lyric Intelligence |date=2008 |publisher=OUP Oxford |page=283}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pushkin |first1=Alexander |title=The Letters of Alexander Pushkin |date=1967 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=164}}</ref>\n\nPushkin gradually became committed to social reform and emerged as a spokesman for literary radicals.

After much hesitation, Natalia accepted a proposal of marriage from Pushkin in April 1830, but not before she received assurances that the Tsarist government had no intentions to persecute the libertarian poet. Later, Pushkin and his wife became regulars of court society. They officially became engaged on 6 May 1830, and sent out wedding invitations. Due to an outbreak of [[cholera]] and other circumstances, the wedding was delayed for a year. The ceremony took place on 18 February 1831 (Old Style) in the [[Great Ascension Church]] on [[Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street]] in Moscow. When the [[Tsar]] gave Pushkin the lowest court title; Gentleman of the Chamber, the poet became enraged, feeling that the Tsar intended to humiliate him by implying that Pushkin was being admitted to court not on his own merits but solely so that his wife, who had many admirers including the Tsar himself, could properly attend court balls.<ref name=\"russiapedia.rt.com\"/>\n\n[[File:D'Anth\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]]\nIn the year 1831, during the period of Pushkin's growing literary influence, he met one of Russia's other great early writers, [[Nikolai Gogol]]. After reading Gogol's 1831\u20131832 volume of short stories ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]'', Pushkin supported him and would feature some of Gogol's most famous short stories in the magazine ''[[Sovremennik|The Contemporary]]'', which he founded in 1836.\n\n==Death==\nBy the autumn of 1836, Pushkin was falling into greater and greater debt and faced scandalous rumours that his wife was having a love affair. On 4 November he sent a challenge to a duel to [[Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anth\u00e8s|Georges d'Anth\u00e8s]], also known as Dantes-Gekkern. [[Jacob van Heeckeren tot Enghuizen|Jacob van Heeckeren]], d'Anth\u00e8s' adoptive father, asked that the duel be delayed by two weeks. With efforts by the poet's friends, the duel was cancelled. On 17 November d'Anth\u00e8s made a proposal to Natalia Goncharova's (Pushkina's) sister \u2013 Ekaterina Goncharova. The marriage did not resolve the conflict. Georges d'Anth\u00e8s continued to pursue Natalia Goncharova in public, and rumours that d'Anth\u00e8s had married Natalia's sister just to save her reputation circulated. On 26 January (7 February in the Gregorian calendar) of 1837 Pushkin sent a \"highly insulting letter\" to Heeckeren. The only answer to that letter could be a challenge to a duel, as Pushkin knew. Pushkin received the formal challenge to a duel through his sister-in-law, Ekaterina Gekkerna, approved by d'Anth\u00e8s, on the same day through the attach\u00e9 of the French Embassy, Viscount d'Archiac. \n\nPushkin asked [[Arthur Magenis]], then attach\u00e9 to the [[Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Saint Petersburg|British Consulate-General in Saint Petersburg]], to be his second. Magenis did not formally accept, but on 26 January (7 February), but approached Viscount d'Archiac to attempt a reconciliation; however, d'Archiac refused to speak with him as he was not yet officially Pushkin's second. Magenis, unable to find Pushkin in the evening, sent him a letter through a messenger at 2 o'clock in the morning, declining to be his second as the possibility of a peaceful settlement had already been quashed, and the traditional first task of the second was to try to bring about a reconciliation.<ref name=\"simmons\">{{cite news |last1=Simmons |first1=Ernest J. |title=Pushkin |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126492/page/n435/mode/2up/search/magenis |accessdate=28 January 2020 |date=1922|ref=Simmons |page=412}}</ref><ref name=\"binyon\">{{cite book |last1=Binyon |first1=T.

D'Anth\u00e8s fired first, critically wounding Pushkin; the bullet entered at his hip and penetrated his abdomen. D'Anth\u00e8s was only lightly wounded in the right arm. Two days later, on 29 January (10 February) at 14:45, Pushkin died of peritonitis.\n\nAt Pushkin's wife's request, he was put in the coffin in evening dress \u2013 not in chamber-cadet uniform, the uniform provided by the tsar. The funeral service was initially assigned to the St. Isaac's Cathedral, but was moved to Konyushennaya church. Many people attended. After the funeral, the coffin was lowered into the basement, where it stayed until 3 February, when it was removed to Pskov province. Alexander Pushkin was buried on the grounds of the Svyatogorsky monastery in present-day [[Pushkinskiye Gory]], near [[Pskov]], beside his mother.

Pushkin is also known for his short stories. In particular his cycle ''[[The Belkin Tales|The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin]]'', including \"[[The Shot (Pushkin)|The Shot]]\", were well received. Pushkin himself preferred his verse novel ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', which he wrote over the course of his life and which, starting a tradition of great Russian novels, follows a few central characters but varies widely in tone and focus.\n\n''Onegin'' is a work of such complexity that, though it is only about a hundred pages long, translator [[Vladimir Nabokov]] needed two full volumes of material to fully render its meaning in English. Because of this difficulty in translation, Pushkin's verse remains largely unknown to English readers. Even so, Pushkin has profoundly influenced western writers like [[Henry James]].<ref name=\"Leary\">[http://www2.newpaltz.edu/~hathaway/ejournal2.html Joseph S.

[[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]'' is the earliest important Pushkin-inspired opera, and a landmark in the tradition of Russian music. [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s operas ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]'' (1879) and ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' (La Dame de Pique, 1890) became perhaps better known outside of Russia than Pushkin's own works of the same name.\n\n[[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s monumental ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' (two versions, 1868\u20139 and 1871\u20132) ranks as one of the very finest and most original of Russian operas.\nOther Russian operas based on Pushkin include [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Dargomyzhsky]]'s ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]'' and ''[[The Stone Guest (Dargomyzhsky)|The Stone Guest]]''; [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[Mozart and Salieri (opera)|Mozart and Salieri]]'', ''[[The Tale of Tsar Saltan (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Tale of Tsar Saltan]]'', and ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''; [[C\u00e9sar Cui|Cui]]'s ''[[Prisoner of the Caucasus (opera)|Prisoner of the Caucasus]]'', ''[[Feast in Time of Plague (opera)|Feast in Time of Plague]]'', and ''[[The Captain's Daughter (opera)|The Captain's Daughter]]''; [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Mazeppa (opera)|Mazeppa]]''; [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]]'s one-act operas ''[[Aleko (opera)|Aleko]]'' (based on ''The Gypsies'') and ''[[The Miserly Knight]]''; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Mavra]]'', and [[Eduard N\u00e1pravn\u00edk|N\u00e1pravn\u00edk]]'s ''[[Dubrovsky (opera)|Dubrovsky]]''.\n\nAdditionally, ballets and [[cantata]]s, as well as innumerable [[Art song|songs]], have been set to Pushkin's verse (including even his French-language poems, in [[Isabelle Aboulker]]'s [[song cycle]] \"[[Troika (album)|Caprice \u00e9trange]]\"). [[Franz von Supp\u00e9|Supp\u00e9]], [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]] and [[Gian Francesco Malipiero|Malipiero]] have also based operas on his works.<ref>Taruskin R.

Russian critics have traditionally argued that his works represent a path from [[Neoclassicism]] through Romanticism to [[Literary realism|Realism]]. An alternative assessment suggests that \"he had an ability to entertain contrarities which may seem Romantic in origin, but are ultimately subversive of all fixed points of view, all single outlooks, including the Romantic\" and that \"he is simultaneously Romantic and not Romantic\".<ref name=basker/>\n\n===Russian language===\nAccording to [[Vladimir Nabokov]], <blockquote>Pushkin's [[idiom]] combined all the contemporaneous elements of Russian with all he had learned from [[Gavrila Derzhavin|Derzhavin]], [[Vasily Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky]], [[Konstantin Batyushkov|Batyushkov]], [[Nikolay Karamzin|Karamzin]] and [[Ivan Krylov|Krylov]]:\n\n# The poetical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] strain that still lived in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] forms and locutions\n# Abundant and natural [[gallicism]]s\n# Everyday [[colloquialism]]s of his set\n# Stylized popular speech by making a salad of the famous three styles (low, medium elevation, high) dear to the pseudoclassical archaists and adding the ingredients of Russian romanticists with a pinch of [[parody]].<ref>[[Vladimir Nabokov]], ''Verses and Versions'', p. 72.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. He is seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, and he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Whenever he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised [[calque]]s. His rich vocabulary and highly-sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of the 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. He introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay and even the personal letter.\n\nHis work as a critic and as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the ''Sovremennik'' (''The Contemporary'', or ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a''). Pushkin inspired the [[Russian fairy tale|folk tales]] and genre pieces of other authors: [[Nikolai Leskov|Leskov]], [[Sergei Yesenin|Yesenin]] and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]]. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Ivan Goncharov]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]], as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as [[Mikhail Lermontov]]. Pushkin was analysed by [[Nikolai Gogol]], his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic [[Vissarion Belinsky]]. The last mentioned also produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\n\n==Honours==\n*In 1929, Soviet writer, Leonid Grossman, published a novel, ''The d'Archiac Papers'', telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the [[Tsar]]ist regime.
