It was likely a grass airfield with a small aircraft parking area and possibly a hangar and a station building.\n\nIn May 1940, as part of the buildup in western Germany prior to the [[Battle of France]], the [[Luftwaffe]] stationed Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) with [[Dornier Do 17]]Z light bombers, and [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] and 21 (JG 3, JG 21) with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E fighters at the airfield. All of these units moved into Belgium shortly after the invasion on 10 May.<ref name=\"vit1\">[http://www.ww2.dk The Luftwaffe, 1933-45]</ref> Vogelsang was not used again by combat aircraft until 1945.\n\nIn late February 1945, as a result of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]], [[United States Army]] forces moved through the [[Eifel]] area and captured the airfield about 1 March. On 8 March the IX Engineer Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began to construct an operational airfield for Allied aircraft. The engineers laid down a 3600' [[Pierced Steel Planking]] runway aligned 15/33 on the former Luftwaffe field to support all-weather operations on the site.  On 23 March the airfield was designated as [[Advanced Landing Ground]] \"Y-51 Vogelsang\".<ref>[http://www.ixengineercommand.com/airfields/physical.php IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout]</ref>\n\nIts operational use by the USAAF was by the [[Ninth Air Force]] [[67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group]], which operated various photo-reconnaissance aircraft (P-38, P-51) from the airfield taking reconnaissance photos west of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] supporting the advancing Ninth Army to close the [[Ruhr Pocket]] until the end of April 1945 when it moved into Central Germany. After the combat units moved out, the airfield remained open, supporting the Occupation forces in the area with transport supply flights until being closed on 10 July 1945.<ref>Maurer, Maurer.

It was likely a grass airfield with a small aircraft parking area and possibly a hangar and a station building.\n\nIn May 1940, as part of the buildup in western Germany prior to the [[Battle of France]], the [[Luftwaffe]] stationed Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) with [[Dornier Do 17]]Z light bombers, and [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] and 21 (JG 3, JG 21) with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E fighters at the airfield. All of these units moved into Belgium shortly after the invasion on 10 May.<ref name=\"vit1\">[http://www.ww2.dk The Luftwaffe, 1933-45]</ref> Vogelsang was not used again by combat aircraft until 1945.\n\nIn late February 1945, as a result of the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]], [[United States Army]] forces moved though the [[Eifel]] area and captured the airfield about 1 March. On 8 March the IX Engineer Command 816th Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began to construct an operational airfield for Allied aircraft. The engineers laid down a 3600' [[Pierced Steel Planking]] runway aligned 15/33 on the former Luftwaffe field to support all-weather operations on the site.  On 23 March the airfield was designated as [[Advanced Landing Ground]] \"Y-51 Vogelsang\".<ref>[http://www.ixengineercommand.com/airfields/physical.php IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout]</ref>\n\nIts operational use by the USAAF was by the [[Ninth Air Force]] [[67th Tactical Reconnaissance Group]], which operated various photo-reconnaissance aircraft (P-38, P-51) from the airfield taking reconnaissance photos west of the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] supporting the advancing Ninth Army to close the [[Ruhr Pocket]] until the end of April 1945 when it moved into Central Germany. After the combat units moved out, the airfield remained open, supporting the Occupation forces in the area with transport supply flights until being closed on 10 July 1945.<ref>Maurer, Maurer.

Once the doors close, the cartoon begins on the movie screen. The short begins with Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto set out for a picnic at the Runnamuck Park, singing ''Nothing Can Stop Us Now''\u00a0while packing the Mickey's car for a picnic. Minnie accidentally packs Pluto and the picnic basket in the trunk.\u00a0The duo make their way\u00a0to the park. Along the way, Mickey and Minnie drive by Goofy, who is conducting the Runnamuck Railroad train that surrounds the park. Mickey and Minnie pull forward and hit a bump on the railroad crossing. The trunk pops open, releasing Pluto and the picnic basket into the air, which Pluto quickly manages to save the picnic basket. However, a pie from the picnic basket falls out and lands on top of the train\u2019s smokestack. With the pie clogging the smokestack, the train picks up speed. Goofy panics as the train pulls into a railroad barn, where an explosion occurs, tearing a big hole through the movie screen via a hidden mechanism used to raise it. When the smoke clears, Goofy lands on a loose board on the outside of the barn. Seeing the guests, Goofy offers them to take a ride on the train. He then asks a nearby cast member to help the guests step inside the cartoon while goes back to the barn to fix the train. Upon walking through the movie screen, the guests find themselves inside the cartoon railroad station, and they make their way to the loading station where the train arrives.\n\n===Ride experience===\nOnce the train stops at the loading station, guests board one of four cars behind the [[locomotive]]. The train then departs the station and makes a left turn, passing the park before entering a [[tunnel]]. Once inside the tunnel, [[Goofy]] opens the back window and asks the guests if they are ready for a tour around the park. Mickey and Minnie in their car pull up next to Goofy and exchange greetings. Mickey parks next to a railroad switch and asks Goofy to take care of the guests. Goofy proudly exclaims, \"Gosh, they're with me, what can possibly go wrong?\" Right when Goofy closes his window, the switch falls, breaking the train up with Goofy and the locomotive making a left and the cars with guests making a right. Mickey and Minnie declare to catch the \"runaway\" train.\n\nThe cars exit the tunnel into the desert with Mickey and Minnie on horses trying to round up the cars. They get their ropes caught on themselves and vultures target them. The cars then make their way to a [[carnival]] where Mickey and Minnie find them while on a sign. Before they could get down, a [[tornado]] occurs, sending the carnival into a frenzy. The cars get a close up to the tornado which has Mickey, Minnie and Pluto sucked up. In the next room, Mickey and Minnie land in a [[tropical island]] where a [[volcanic eruption]] occurs. Each of the four cars enter their own separate rooms to find Mickey and Minnie going downstream towards a waterfall. They go underwater and the cars pull back to the tropical isle room, which is now an underwater scene. This is achieved through a special effect in which the entirely the room background is a screen that changes. \n\nThe cars go down a drain pipe into the city, where Pete is doing construction work and Donald is stuck in traffic. The cars detour into a dance studio where Daisy has the cars \"dance\". The cars \"[[waltz]]\" before Daisy announces a [[conga]]. The cars \"conga\" out the studio through an alley and enter a dangerous factory Mickey and Minnie try to stop the cars from being smashed by the Smasher on a conveyor belt. Mickey and Minnie pull the switch, which shuts the factory down and it magically transforms into a moonlit night at the park. The cars reverse and turn around to find Goofy and the locomotive at the front of the \"train\". As the guests enter a tunnel, Goofy concludes the tour and hopes that the guests had a good time. The train pull around the corner to find Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto having a picnic and singing one final rendition of \"Nothing Can Stop Us Now\" while fireworks go off in the sky above and the guests. Goofy waves goodbye to the guests and closes the back window. Just before the train enter the station, Goofy finds a lever and pulls it to find a small explosion in the cab as the train arrives back to the railroad barn.

Once the doors close, the cartoon begins on the movie screen. The short begins with Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto set out for a picnic at the Runnamuck Park, singing ''Nothing Can Stop Us Now''\u00a0while packing the Mickey's car for a picnic. Minnie accidentally packs Pluto and the picnic basket in the trunk.\u00a0The duo make their way\u00a0to the park. Along the way, Mickey and Minnie drive by Goofy, who is conducting the Runnamuck Railroad train that surrounds the park. Mickey and Minnie pull forward and hit a bump on the railroad crossing. The trunk pops open, releasing Pluto and the picnic basket into the air, which Pluto quickly manages to save the picnic basket. However, a pie from the picnic basket falls out and lands on top of the train\u2019s smokestack. With the pie clogging the smokestack, the train picks up speed. Goofy panics as the train pulls into a railroad barn, where an explosion occurs, tearing a big hole through the movie screen via a hidden mechanism used to raise it. When the smoke clears, Goofy lands on a loose board on the outside of the barn. Seeing the guests, Goofy offers them to take a ride on the train. He then asks a nearby cast member to help the guests step inside the cartoon while goes back to the barn to fix the train. Upon walking through the movie screen, the guests find themselves inside the cartoon railroad station, and they make their way to the loading station where the train arrives.\n\n===Ride experience===\nOnce the train stops at the loading station, guests board one of four cars behind the [[locomotive]]. The train then departs the station and makes a left turn, passing the park before entering a [[tunnel]]. Once inside the tunnel, [[Goofy]] opens the back window and asks the guests if they are ready for a tour around the park. Mickey and Minnie in their car pull up next to Goofy and exchange greetings. Mickey parks next to a railroad switch and asks Goofy to take care of the guests. Goofy proudly exclaims, \"Gosh, they're with me, what can possibly go wrong?\" Right when Goofy closes his window, the switch falls, breaking the train up with Goofy and the locomotive making a left and the cars with guests making a right. Mickey and Minnie declare to catch the \"runaway\" train.\n\nThe cars exit the tunnel into the desert with Mickey and Minnie on horses trying to round up the cars. They get their ropes caught on themselves and vultures target them. The cars then make their way to a [[carnival]] where Mickey and Minnie find them while on a sign. Before they could get down, a [[tornado]] occurs, sending the carnival into a frenzy. The cars get a close up to the tornado which has Mickey, Minnie and Pluto sucked up. In the next room, Mickey and Minnie land in a [[tropical island]] where a [[volcanic eruption]] occurs. Each of the four cars enter their own separate rooms to find Mickey and Minnie going downstream towards a waterfall. They go underwater and the cars pull back to the tropical isle room, which is now an underwater scene. This is achieved through a special effect in which the entirely the room background is a screen that changes. \n\nThe cars go down a drain pipe into the city, where Pete is doing construction work and Donald is stuck in traffic. The cars detour into a dance studio where Daisy has the cars \"dance\". The cars \"[[waltz]]\" before Daisy announces a [[conga]]. The cars \"conga\" out the studio through an alley and enter a dangerous factory Mickey and Minnie try to stop the cars from being smashed by the Smasher on a conveyor belt. Mickey and Minnie pull the switch, which shuts the factory down and it magically transforms into a moonlit night at the park. The cars reverse and turn around to find Goofy and the locomotive at the front of the \"train\". As the guests enter a tunnel, Goofy concludes the tour and hopes that the guests had a good time. The train pull around the corner to find Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto having a picnic and singing one final rendition of \"Nothing Can Stop Us Now\" while fireworks go off in the sky above and the guests. Goofy waves goodbye to the guests and closes the back window. Just before the train enter the station, Goofy finds a lever and pulls it to find a small explosion in the cab as the train arrives back to the railroad barn. As guests leave the station, they pass through the movie screen to return to the real world, the title card saying \u201cThe End\u201d is displayed as guests leave the theater.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Chris Diamantopoulos]] as [[Mickey Mouse]]\n* [[Russi Taylor]] as [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]\n* [[Tony Anselmo]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n* [[Bill Farmer]] as [[Goofy]] and [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]\n* [[Jim Cummings]] as [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]]\n* [[Tress MacNeille]] as [[Daisy Duck]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/hollywood-studios/mickey-minnies-runaway-railway/ Disney's Hollywood Studios site]\n\n{{Disney's Hollywood Studios}}\n{{Disneyland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway}}\n[[Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides planned to open in 2022]]\n[[Category:Audio-Animatronic attractions]]\n[[Category:Disney's Hollywood Studios]]\n[[Category:Hollywood Boulevard (Disney's Hollywood Studios)]]\n[[Category:Disneyland]]\n[[Category:Mickey's Toontown]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions]]\n[[Category:Dark rides]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse]]\n", "name_user": "Elisfkc", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_%26_Minnie%27s_Runaway_Railway"}

producers such as [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]], [[Max Martin]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh]] and [[Pop Wansel|Andrew \"Pop\" Wansel]]. The album was created in the midst of personal matters, including the death of former boyfriend [[Mac Miller]] and her break-up with fianc\u00e9 [[Pete Davidson]].\n\n''Thank U, Next'' was preceded by two singles, the  [[Thank U, Next (song)|title track]] and \"[[7 Rings]]\", both debuting atop the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, becoming Grande's first and second number one single in the US, respectively. \"[[Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored]]\" was released as the third single on the day of the album's release, peaking at number two on the Hot 100. In support of both ''Sweetener'' and ''Thank U, Next'', Grande embarked on the [[Sweetener World Tour]], beginning on March 18, 2019. The album peaked atop the charts of many countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. One month after its release, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for moving one million [[album-equivalent units]] in the US.\n\nUpon its release, ''Thank U, Next'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with many praising its cohesiveness and production.

''Old School: Essays on Japanese Martial Traditions'', Edgework, p.&nbsp;21\u201345</ref>\n\nIizasa was born in the village of Iizasa in [[Shim\u014dsa Province]].  When he was young, he moved to the vicinity of the famous Katori Shrine, a venerable [[Shinto]] institution northeast of Tokyo in modern-day [[Chiba Prefecture]]. The Katori Shrine enjoys a considerable martial reputation; the Shrine's [[Kami]], [[Futsunushi]] {{nihongo| \u7d4c\u6d25\u4e3b\u795e |Futsunushi no kami}} being revered as a spirit of swordsmanship and martial arts.<ref name=\"Amdur2002\"/>\n\nAfter studying swordsmanship he went to Kyoto, where, according to most authorities, he was employed in his youth by the eighth [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] [[sh\u014dgun]], [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] (1436\u20131490), a devotee of the martial arts. Iizasa was later known as Yamashiro no Kami (governor of [[Yamashiro Province]]) in accordance with a practice of Muromachi times, whereby noted warriors took old court titles. Later on in his life, Iizasa became a Buddhist lay monk and was known as Ch\u014di-sai, ''sai'' being a character that many noted swordsmen chose for their [[Bug\u014d|martial name]].\n\nWhen Ch\u014di-sai returned home, he offered prayers to the deities of both Katori Shrine and [[Kashima Shrine]], the latter being a famous local shrine in nearby [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], where shrine officials themselves reputedly practised a form of swordsmanship, called 'Hitotsu no Tachi' (the solitary sword). Even today the Kashima Shrine training hall attracts [[Kendo]] practitioners from around the world, and the chief object of interest for visitors is the shrine's sacred sword. Supplementing his considerable skills with assorted weaponry, Ch\u014di-sai was also an expert in Mus\u014d Jikiden ry\u016b ''yawaragi'', holding the position of seventh Headmaster in the history of that ry\u016b.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} <ref group=\"notes\">''Yawara'' or ''yawaragi'' is an older term for [[jujutsu|j\u016bjutsu]], unarmed combat, of that period. Contrast with modern jujutsu, ''yawara'' was mostly grappling while wearing armour.</ref>\n\nLegend says at the age of 60 Ch\u014di-sai spent 1000 days in Katori Shrine practicing martial techniques day and night, until the ''[[kami]]'' of the shrine, [[Futsunushi]] (\u7d4c\u6d25), appeared to him in a dream and handed down the secrets of martial strategy in a scroll named ''Mokuroku Heiho no Shinsho''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}  He called his swordsmanship style derived from this miraculous dream the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b, the \"Heavenly True, Correctly Transmitted Style of the Way of the God of Katori\".\n\nThis legend is typical of martial arts ry\u016b and other cultural forms as well. Ry\u016b founders often attributed their mastery to magical teachings transmitted by Shinto or Buddhist deities, by long-dead historical figures like [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]], or by legendary supernatural creatures such as the ''[[tengu]]'', Japanese [[goblin]]s commonly depicted with a long red nose.\n\nIizasa's Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b, thus presumably linked to the sacred tradition of both Katori and Kashima Shrines, was transmitted through his own family.\n\n===Headmasters===\n# Iizasa Yamashiro-no-Kami (later Iga-no-Kami) Ienao Choisai, died 15 April 1488\n# Iizasa Wakasa-no-Kami Morichika\n# Iizasa Wakasa-no-Kami Morinobu\n# Iizasa Yamashiro-no-Kami Moritsuna\n# Iizasa Saemon-no-Jo Morihide\n# Iizasa Oi-no-Kami Morishige\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morinobu\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morinaga\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morihisa\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morisada\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morishige\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Moritsugu\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morikiyo\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Nagateru\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Moriteru\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morishige (Kan-Rikusai), died 11 July 1853, at 78 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morifusa, died 4 January 1854, at 51 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morisada, participated in the [[Mito Rebellion]] against the shogunate, died 2 June 1896, at 56 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Kinjiro, died in 1943\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Yasusada (current)\n\nIn 1896, the 18th [[s\u014dke]] died without a male heir.

Until Iizasa Kinjiro married into the Iizasa household, the following eight shihan headed the ryu:<ref>Sugino, Yoshio (2016).

Several famous swordsmen (including [[Tsukahara Bokuden]] and Matsumoto Bizen no kami Masanobu) who learned directly from Ch\u014di-sai or his immediate followers became founders of their own schools, with either the same name (Shint\u014d, written with a variety of other characters) or different names: [[Kashima Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]] (Bokuden-ry\u016b), Kashima-ry\u016b, Kashima shin-ry\u016b (founded by Matsumoto), Arima-ry\u016b, Ichiu-ry\u016b, Shigen-ry\u016b, and others.\n\nIizasa devised a unique method to ensure warriors could train without serious injury and yet maintain a resemblance to 'riai' (integrity of principle) and combative reality. The weapon training of the ry\u016b, in the form of [[kata]]-bujutsu (pre-arranged, combative training drills), illustrates this well. What appears to the outsider as merely a block of the opponent's attacking weapon is, in actuality, only a substitute for the part of the attacker's body intended to be cut or struck. Thus, full impact training could be maintained with safety to the practitioners. Thereby, he extended the training of his students to the use of other weapon systems as well, in order to be totally familiar with their capabilities and not be surprised on the battlefield by something unexpectedly different.\n\nThe uniqueness of Iizasa's Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is still evident today, in the particular aspects of weapon-wielding, posture, stance, and foot and body movements which make allowance for the fact that the bushi (classical [[samurai]] warriors) of his era would be wearing '[[\u014c-yoroi|yoroi]]' (armour) weighing around 35&nbsp;kg, and fighting on uneven terrain. These factors tend to keep the wearer's feet firmly and flat on the ground, and slow down mobility considerably.  The distinctive techniques and tactics of this ry\u016b also acknowledge the design of classical Japanese armour, which, although protecting the wearer well, had many 'suki' (openings). The main attacking areas included: under the wrists; inside and behind the legs; the hip area; the space between the '[[kabuto]]' (helmet) and '[[D\u014d (armour)|d\u014d]]' (chest protector) where the neck arteries and veins could be easily severed. The signature, 'omote' (basic-battlefield) sword technique of the ry\u016b, 'makiuchi-jodan', was created by Iizasa because the bushi could not raise the sword above the head due to the obstruction of the kabuto{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}, and secondly, notwithstanding that restriction, a very powerful 'chopping' blow from above was still needed to be generated in order to produce the maximum destructive force for when circumstances dictated attacking areas of the 'yoroi' other than the 'suki'.\n\nOn 6 March 1960 (\u662d\u548c35\u5e746\u67083\u65e5), the school received the first ever \"Intangible Cultural Asset\" designation given to a martial art by the Japanese government, naming Hayashi Yazaemon, [[Risuke Otake|\u014ctake Risuke]], and Iizasa Yasusada as its guardians. The Iizasa family dojo was also designated a Cultural Asset. The designation of Cultural Asset status shifted to the Chiba Prefectural Government in 1985 and the art was recertified, again naming \u014ctake Risuke and Iizasa Yasusada as guardians <ref>\u014ctake, Risuke (2007). ''Katori Shinto-ryu: Warrior Tradition''. Koryu Books. p 22-23. {{ISBN|978-1-890536-21-3}}</ref>. \u014ctake Nobutoshi and Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi were also certified as guardians on 30 March 2004 (\u5e73\u621016\u5e743\u670830\u65e5)<ref>https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kyouiku/bunkazai/bunkazai/p211-005.html</ref>. \n\nThe school claims to have never aligned itself with any estate or faction, no matter what stipend was offered.  This allowed the ''ry\u016b'' to maintain its independence and integrity.\n\nTenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b was popularised in the west by the extensive research and writings of late [[Donn F. Draeger]] (1922\u20131982).\n\nThe current, twentieth generation [[s\u014dke|headmaster]], is Iizasa Yasusada (\u98ef\u7be0 \u4fee\u7406\u4eae \u5feb\u8c9e ''Iizasa Sh\u016bri-no-suke Yasusada''). He does not teach his family's system and had instead appointed as his main representative instructor [[Risuke \u014ctake]] who has a personal dojo close to [[Narita, Chiba|Narita City]]. Upon \u014ctake Risuke's retirement, he announced his eldest son Nobutoshi would replace him as Shihan and his younger son Shigetoshi would support him as shihan-dai. Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi was appointed shihan in September 2017.<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/instruction/</ref>, and \u014ctake Nobutoshi was issued hamon (excommunicated) on 9 December 2018.<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/important-message/</ref>However, both Otake Risuke, Otake Nobutoshi and Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi are still recognised as guardians of the school, by the Chiba Prefecture Board of Cultural Affairs.<ref>https://www.katorishintoryu.jp/en-introduction</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nKenjyutsu-2.jpg|Meiji Shrine annual festival dedication Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\nKenjyutsu-2a.jpg|Same as left, Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\nKenjyutsu-2b.jpg|Same as left, Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\n</gallery>\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\nThe Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is a comprehensive martial system.

The method was to make ''keppan'' (blood oath) in support of the following ''kisho'' or ''kishomon'' (pledge). This oath was a written one with the prospective member being required to sign his name in his own blood. The applicant would prick or cut a finger or sometimes the inner arm and with the blood drawn, sign the following pledge:<ref name=\"WarriorTrad\">\n\u014ctake, Risuke (2007). ''Katori Shinto-ryu: Warrior Tradition'', Koryu Books. {{ISBN|978-1-890536-20-6}} (A total revamp of ''The Deity and the Sword'', combining all 3 volumes into one re-translated and edited book with additional material. However, with far fewer photographs per kata as compared to the original 3 volumes. Similarly, all the original English explanatory notes and guidelines relating to each of the kata have been removed.)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nOn becoming a member of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b which has been transmitted by the Great Deity of the Katori Shrine, I herewith affirm my pledge that:\n#I will not have the impertinence to discuss or demonstrate details of the ''ry\u016b'' to either non-members or members, even if they are relatives;\n#I will not engage in altercations or misuse the art against others;\n#I will never engage in any kind of gambling nor frequent disreputable places.\n#I will not cross swords with any followers of other martial traditions without authorization.\nI hereby pledge to firmly adhere to each of the above articles. Should I break any of these articles I will submit to the punishment of the Great Deity of Katori and the Great Deity Marishiten. Herewith I solemnly swear and affix my blood seal to this oath to these Great Deities.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Marishi-Ten|Marishiten]] is originally the Brahman figure of [[Krishna]]. In later Chinese Buddhist mythology she became the heavenly queen who lives in one of the stars of the Great Bear. She is mostly depicted with eight arms, two of which are the symbols of the sun and the moon.\n\nMost Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b variants headed by instructors other than [[Risuke \u014ctake]] do not require keppan. However, Risuke \u014ctake regards the making of keppan as a strict requirement for all candidates seeking entrance into his school in order to preserve the secrecy and integrity of the ry\u016b's teachings.  Even so, students joining his various overseas branches readily receive instruction from the local instructors until such time as they may be able to travel to \u014ctake's dojo to take keppan.  Additional opportunities arise should an overseas dojo be visited by one of the school's senior instructors who has been authorised to take keppan from those members wishing so to do.  This was the case in 2007, and again in 2009 when Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi, younger son of Risuke \u014ctake, held an open European seminar and existing participants of varying levels of expertise from the different organisations were invited to take keppan.\n\n==Branches==\nThe mainline of Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is currently represented by the Ky\u014ds\u014d Shibu led by Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/instruction/</ref>, \u014ctake Risuke's younger son. The honbu dojo is located at Iizasa Yasusada's home near the Katori shrine and is used by branches in good standing on special occasions. The Ky\u014ds\u014d Shibu regularly trains out of the Shisui Town Community Plaza and the Matsuyamashita Koen Sports Gymnasium in Inzai City.<ref>http://katori-shinto-ryu.org/en/dojo/</ref> Several branches have existed alongside or split from the mainline with varying ties to the Iizasa family.\n\n*Shinbukan Dojo \u2013 The Shinbukan Dojo in Narita was built by \u014ctake Risuke and represented the mainline of the ry\u016b for over fifty years.<ref>https://www.katorishintoryu.jp/en-introduction</ref> Although \u014ctake Risuke has now retired as shihan, he still oversees instruction in the Shinbukan, which is led by his son \u014ctake Nobutoshi.<ref>https://www.katorishintoryu.jp/en-introduction</ref>\n*Sugino Dojo \u2013 Sugino Yoshio, a judoka, began training in Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b when [[Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d]] invited four shihan to teach swordsmanship at the [[Kodokan]] dojo. He continued his training under Shiina Ichizo. Many of his students have taught Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b outside of Japan. His son, Sugino Yukihiro has continued to teach, and has received public acknowledgement from Iizasa Yasusada as representing an official branch of Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b. \n*Hatakeyama Goro \u2013 A high-ranking student of Sugino's, Hatakeyama Goro, had led several dojos internationally prior to his death. These dojos now operate independently.\n*Sugawara Budo \u2013 Sugawara Tetsutaka edited and published ''The Deity and The Sword'' through his own publishing company. He was awarded menkyo kyoshi (teaching license) in 1986, but later separated from the mainline. He currently teaches Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b as part of Sugawara Martial Arts Institute's curriculum.\n*Noda-ha \u2013 Noda Shinzan (1848\u20131917) began training in Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b in 1853 under Yamada Naomune, a retainer of the [[Date clan]]. Many Date retainers had trained in Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b and developed their own distinctive style. After Naomune's death in 1912, Shinzan enrolled his grandson, Seizan, under Yamaguchi Kumajiro, the most senior mainline shihan at the time. Following the deaths of Yamaguchi and his grandfather, Noda Seizan continued to train under Motomiya Toranosuke. After Motomiya's passing, Noda studied with Hayashi Yazaemon who began reforming and standardizing the mainline curriculum. Finding his style incompatible with Hayashi's, Noda Seizan quietly withdrew to private teaching, referring to his branch as Noda-ha Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b. Noda-ha preserves some kata that have been lost in the mainline.<ref name=\"Amdur2013\">Amdur, Ellis (2013).

He incorporates Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b as part of the curriculum of his Ichigid\u014d organization and maintains a positive relationship with the Iizasa family.

His son, Mochizuki Hiro, now heads Yoseikan.\n\n==Ranking & Appointed Positions==\nThe different branches recognize different levels of ranks and appointments.

''Old School: Essays on Japanese Martial Traditions'', Edgework, p.&nbsp;21\u201345</ref>\n\nIizasa was born in the village of Iizasa in [[Shim\u014dsa Province]].  When he was young, he moved to the vicinity of the famous Katori Shrine, a venerable [[Shinto]] institution northeast of Tokyo in modern-day [[Chiba Prefecture]]. The Katori Shrine enjoys a considerable martial reputation; the Shrine's [[Kami]], [[Futsunushi]] {{nihongo| \u7d4c\u6d25\u4e3b\u795e |Futsunushi no kami}} being revered as a spirit of swordsmanship and martial arts.<ref name=\"Amdur2002\"/>\n\nAfter studying swordsmanship he went to Kyoto, where, according to most authorities, he was employed in his youth by the eighth [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] [[sh\u014dgun]], [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] (1436\u20131490), a devotee of the martial arts. Iizasa was later known as Yamashiro no Kami (governor of [[Yamashiro Province]]) in accordance with a practice of Muromachi times, whereby noted warriors took old court titles. Later on in his life, Iizasa became a Buddhist lay monk and was known as Ch\u014di-sai, ''sai'' being a character that many noted swordsmen chose for their [[Bug\u014d|martial name]].\n\nWhen Ch\u014di-sai returned home, he offered prayers to the deities of both Katori Shrine and [[Kashima Shrine]], the latter being a famous local shrine in nearby [[Ibaraki Prefecture]], where shrine officials themselves reputedly practised a form of swordsmanship, called 'Hitotsu no Tachi' (the solitary sword). Even today the Kashima Shrine training hall attracts [[Kendo]] practitioners from around the world, and the chief object of interest for visitors is the shrine's sacred sword. Supplementing his considerable skills with assorted weaponry, Ch\u014di-sai was also an expert in Mus\u014d Jikiden ry\u016b ''yawaragi'', holding the position of seventh Headmaster in the history of that ry\u016b.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} <ref group=\"notes\">''Yawara'' or ''yawaragi'' is an older term for [[jujutsu|j\u016bjutsu]], unarmed combat, of that period. Contrast with modern jujutsu, ''yawara'' was mostly grappling while wearing armour.</ref>\n\nLegend says at the age of 60 Ch\u014di-sai spent 1000 days in Katori Shrine practicing martial techniques day and night, until the ''[[kami]]'' of the shrine, [[Futsunushi]] (\u7d4c\u6d25), appeared to him in a dream and handed down the secrets of martial strategy in a scroll named ''Mokuroku Heiho no Shinsho''.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}  He called his swordsmanship style derived from this miraculous dream the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b, the \"Heavenly True, Correctly Transmitted Style of the Way of the God of Katori\".\n\nThis legend is typical of martial arts ry\u016b and other cultural forms as well. Ry\u016b founders often attributed their mastery to magical teachings transmitted by Shinto or Buddhist deities, by long-dead historical figures like [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]], or by legendary supernatural creatures such as the ''[[tengu]]'', Japanese [[goblin]]s commonly depicted with a long red nose.\n\nIizasa's Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b, thus presumably linked to the sacred tradition of both Katori and Kashima Shrines, was transmitted through his own family.\n\n===Headmasters===\n# Iizasa Yamashiro-no-Kami (later Iga-no-Kami) Ienao Choisai, died 15 April 1488\n# Iizasa Wakasa-no-Kami Morichika\n# Iizasa Wakasa-no-Kami Morinobu\n# Iizasa Yamashiro-no-Kami Moritsuna\n# Iizasa Saemon-no-Jo Morihide\n# Iizasa Oi-no-Kami Morishige\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morinobu\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morinaga\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morihisa\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morisada\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morishige\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Moritsugu\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morikiyo\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Nagateru\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Moriteru\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morishige (Kan-Rikusai), died 11 July 1853, at 78 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morifusa, died 4 January 1854, at 51 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Morisada, participated in the [[Mito Rebellion]] against the shogunate, died 2 June 1896, at 56 years of age\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Kinjiro, died in 1943\n# Iizasa Shuri-no-Suke Yasusada (current)\n\nIn 1896, the 18th [[s\u014dke]] died without a male heir. Yamaguchi Eikan [[shihan]] governed the ryu until his death 14 March 1917. Until Iizasa Kinjiro married into the Iizasa household, the following eight shihan headed the ryu:<ref>Sugino, Yoshio (2016). ''Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu: Budo Kyohan'', Ulf Rott</ref>\n* Tamai Kisaburo\n* Shiina Ichizo\n* Ito Tanekichi\n* Kuboki Sazaemon\n* Isobe Kohei\n* Motomiya (Hongu) Toranosuke \n* Hayashi Yazaemon (1882\u20131964)\n* Kamagata Minosuke\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:Risuke_\u014ctake.jpg|thumb|[[Risuke Otake]] (2012)]]\nTenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is the source tradition of many [[Japanese martial arts]]. Several famous swordsmen (including [[Tsukahara Bokuden]] and Matsumoto Bizen no kami Masanobu) who learned directly from Ch\u014di-sai or his immediate followers became founders of their own schools, with either the same name (Shint\u014d, written with a variety of other characters) or different names: [[Kashima Shint\u014d-ry\u016b]] (Bokuden-ry\u016b), Kashima-ry\u016b, Kashima shin-ry\u016b (founded by Matsumoto), Arima-ry\u016b, Ichiu-ry\u016b, Shigen-ry\u016b, and others.\n\nIizasa devised a unique method to ensure warriors could train without serious injury and yet maintain a resemblance to 'riai' (integrity of principle) and combative reality. The weapon training of the ry\u016b, in the form of [[kata]]-bujutsu (pre-arranged, combative training drills), illustrates this well. What appears to the outsider as merely a block of the opponent's attacking weapon is, in actuality, only a substitute for the part of the attacker's body intended to be cut or struck. Thus, full impact training could be maintained with safety to the practitioners. Thereby, he extended the training of his students to the use of other weapon systems as well, in order to be totally familiar with their capabilities and not be surprised on the battlefield by something unexpectedly different.\n\nThe uniqueness of Iizasa's Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is still evident today, in the particular aspects of weapon-wielding, posture, stance, and foot and body movements which make allowance for the fact that the bushi (classical [[samurai]] warriors) of his era would be wearing '[[\u014c-yoroi|yoroi]]' (armour) weighing around 35&nbsp;kg, and fighting on uneven terrain. These factors tend to keep the wearer's feet firmly and flat on the ground, and slow down mobility considerably.  The distinctive techniques and tactics of this ry\u016b also acknowledge the design of classical Japanese armour, which, although protecting the wearer well, had many 'suki' (openings). The main attacking areas included: under the wrists; inside and behind the legs; the hip area; the space between the '[[kabuto]]' (helmet) and '[[D\u014d (armour)|d\u014d]]' (chest protector) where the neck arteries and veins could be easily severed. The signature, 'omote' (basic-battlefield) sword technique of the ry\u016b, 'makiuchi-jodan', was created by Iizasa because the bushi could not raise the sword above the head due to the obstruction of the kabuto{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}, and secondly, notwithstanding that restriction, a very powerful 'chopping' blow from above was still needed to be generated in order to produce the maximum destructive force for when circumstances dictated attacking areas of the 'yoroi' other than the 'suki'.\n\nOn 6 March 1960 (\u662d\u548c35\u5e746\u67083\u65e5), the school received the first ever \"Intangible Cultural Asset\" designation given to a martial art by the Japanese government, naming Hayashi Yazaemon, [[Risuke Otake|\u014ctake Risuke]], and Iizasa Yasusada as its guardians. The Iizasa family dojo was also designated a Cultural Asset. The designation of Cultural Asset status shifted to the Chiba Prefectural Government in 1985 and the art was recertified, again naming \u014ctake Risuke and Iizasa Yasusada as guardians <ref>\u014ctake, Risuke (2007). ''Katori Shinto-ryu: Warrior Tradition''. Koryu Books. p 22-23. {{ISBN|978-1-890536-21-3}}</ref>. \u014ctake Nobutoshi and Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi were also certified as guardians on 30 March 2004 (\u5e73\u621016\u5e743\u670830\u65e5)<ref>https://www.pref.chiba.lg.jp/kyouiku/bunkazai/bunkazai/p211-005.html</ref>. \n\nThe school claims to have never aligned itself with any estate or faction, no matter what stipend was offered.  This allowed the ''ry\u016b'' to maintain its independence and integrity.\n\nTenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b was popularised in the west by the extensive research and writings of late [[Donn F. Draeger]] (1922\u20131982).\n\nThe current, twentieth generation [[s\u014dke|headmaster]], is Iizasa Yasusada (\u98ef\u7be0 \u4fee\u7406\u4eae \u5feb\u8c9e ''Iizasa Sh\u016bri-no-suke Yasusada''). He does not teach his family's system and had instead appointed as his main representative instructor [[Risuke \u014ctake]] who has a personal dojo close to [[Narita, Chiba|Narita City]]. Upon \u014ctake Risuke's retirement, he announced his eldest son Nobutoshi would replace him as Shihan and his younger son Shigetoshi would support him as shihan-dai. Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi was appointed shihan in September 2017.<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/instruction/</ref>, and \u014ctake Nobutoshi was issued hamon (excommunicated) on 9 December 2018.<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/important-message/</ref>However, both Otake Risuke, Otake Nobutoshi and Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi are still recognised as guardians of the school, by the Chiba Prefecture Board of Cultural Affairs.<ref>https://www.katorishintoryu.jp/en-introduction</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nKenjyutsu-2.jpg|Meiji Shrine annual festival dedication Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\nKenjyutsu-2a.jpg|Same as left, Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\nKenjyutsu-2b.jpg|Same as left, Tenshin Shinden Katori Shinto (3 November 2011)\n</gallery>\n\n== Curriculum ==\n\nThe Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is a comprehensive martial system.

The method was to make ''keppan'' (blood oath) in support of the following ''kisho'' or ''kishomon'' (pledge). This oath was a written one with the prospective member being required to sign his name in his own blood. The applicant would prick or cut a finger or sometimes the inner arm and with the blood drawn, sign the following pledge:<ref name=\"WarriorTrad\">\n\u014ctake, Risuke (2007). ''Katori Shinto-ryu: Warrior Tradition'', Koryu Books. {{ISBN|978-1-890536-20-6}} (A total revamp of ''The Deity and the Sword'', combining all 3 volumes into one re-translated and edited book with additional material. However, with far fewer photographs per kata as compared to the original 3 volumes. Similarly, all the original English explanatory notes and guidelines relating to each of the kata have been removed.)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nOn becoming a member of the Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b which has been transmitted by the Great Deity of the Katori Shrine, I herewith affirm my pledge that:\n#I will not have the impertinence to discuss or demonstrate details of the ''ry\u016b'' to either non-members or members, even if they are relatives;\n#I will not engage in altercations or misuse the art against others;\n#I will never engage in any kind of gambling nor frequent disreputable places.\n#I will not cross swords with any followers of other martial traditions without authorization.\nI hereby pledge to firmly adhere to each of the above articles. Should I break any of these articles I will submit to the punishment of the Great Deity of Katori and the Great Deity Marishiten. Herewith I solemnly swear and affix my blood seal to this oath to these Great Deities.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Marishi-Ten|Marishiten]] is originally the Brahman figure of [[Krishna]]. In later Chinese Buddhist mythology she became the heavenly queen who lives in one of the stars of the Great Bear. She is mostly depicted with eight arms, two of which are the symbols of the sun and the moon.\n\nMost Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b variants headed by instructors other than [[Risuke \u014ctake]] do not require keppan. However, Risuke \u014ctake regards the making of keppan as a strict requirement for all candidates seeking entrance into his school in order to preserve the secrecy and integrity of the ry\u016b's teachings.  Even so, students joining his various overseas branches readily receive instruction from the local instructors until such time as they may be able to travel to \u014ctake's dojo to take keppan.  Additional opportunities arise should an overseas dojo be visited by one of the school's senior instructors who has been authorised to take keppan from those members wishing so to do.  This was the case in 2007, and again in 2009 when Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi, younger son of Risuke \u014ctake, held an open European seminar and existing participants of varying levels of expertise from the different organisations were invited to take keppan.\n\n==Branches==\nThe mainline of Tenshin Sh\u014dden Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b is currently represented by the Ky\u014ds\u014d Shibu led by Ky\u014ds\u014d Shigetoshi<ref>http://katori-shintoryu.jp/en/instruction/</ref>, \u014ctake Risuke's younger son.

He continued his training under Shiina Ichizo. Many of his students have taught Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b outside of Japan.

Many Date retainers had trained in Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b and developed their own distinctive style. After Naomune's death in 1912, Shinzan enrolled his grandson, Seizan, under Yamaguchi Kumajiro, the most senior mainline shihan at the time. Following the deaths of Yamaguchi and his grandfather, Noda Seizan continued to train under Motomiya Toranosuke. After Motomiya's passing, Noda studied with Hayashi Yazaemon who began reforming and standardizing the mainline curriculum. Finding his style incompatible with Hayashi's, Noda Seizan quietly withdrew to private teaching, referring to his branch as Noda-ha Katori Shint\u014d-ry\u016b.

It supports [[general aviation]] with no commercial airline service scheduled.\n\n==History==\nPeronne Airport was a pre-[[World War II]] civil airport, consisting of a terminal, hangar, some support buildings and a grass airfield, serving the nearby city of Saint-Quentin.\n\n===German use during World War II===\nIt was seized by the Germans in June 1940 during the early part of the  [[Battle of France]], however, the airport was not used by any [[Luftwaffe]] units for several years.  Beginning in 1944, several Luftwaffe Anti-Aircraft units,  Flak-Regiment 87 and Flak-Regiment 19 based their batteries of [[8.8 cm FlaK 18/36/37/41|8.8 cm (88mm) FlaK]] guns at the site.<ref name=\"vit1\">[http://www.ww2.dk  The Luftwaffe, 1933-45]</ref>\n\nIn addition, the Germans laid down two 1500m all-weather concrete runways at the airport, aligned 04/22 and 09/27. Presumably, this was due to the fortification of the [[Pas-de-Calais]], being believed by the Germans that when the Americans and British tried to land in France to open a Second Front, the airfield would have a key role in the defense of France.\n\nBeginning in mid-June 1944, elements of the \"Arctic Ocean ''(Eismeer)'' fighter wing\", [[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (JG 5) was assigned to the airfield, with [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]G day interceptor fighters.<ref name=\"vit1\"/>  From Peronne, JG 5 began attacking the USAAF [[Eighth Air Force]] heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Occupied Europe and Germany.  Previously not attacked by Allied bombers, the airport came under frequent attack by [[Ninth Air Force]] [[B-26 Marauder]] medium bombers and [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when [[Eighth Air Force]] heavy bombers ([[B-17]]s, [[B-24]]s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers.<ref>Derived from information in USAAF Film \"Target For Today\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4)</ref>\n\n===American use===\n[[File:397th BG Martin B-26B-55-MA Marauder 42-96153.jpg|thumb|397th Bombardment Group Martin B-26B-55-MA Marauder 42-96153 at Peronne Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) A-72, January 1945.]]\n\nAmerican Ninth Army units moved through the area in early September 1944, heading towards Saint-Quentin.  On 5 September   The IX Engineer Command 862d Engineer Aviation Battalion moved in and began a quick rehabilitation of the base so it could be used by American aircraft.  It was declared operationally ready for [[Ninth Air Force]] combat units on 6 September, only a few days after its capture from German forces, being designated as [[Advanced Landing Ground]] \"A-72 Peronne Airfield\"<ref>[http://www.ixengineercommand.com/airfields/physical.php IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout]</ref>\n\nIn addition to the airfield, tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. It hosted the following known [[Ninth Air Force]] units:<ref>Maurer, Maurer. ''Air Force Combat Units of World War II''.

There was much unexploded ordnance at the site which needed to be removed, as well as the wreckage of German and Allied aircraft. All of the buildings at the base were destroyed by the Allied air attacks or demolition, and although some had been repaired by the American combat engineers, most were in ruins. The French Air Force had no interest in the facility, and there was no money available to restore and rebuilt the prewar airport.  As a result, the Air Ministry leased the land, concrete runways, structures and all, out to farmers for agricultural use, sending in unexploded ordnance teams to remove the dangerous munitions.\n\nIn 1950 when as a result of the [[Cold War]] threat of the [[Soviet Union]], the air base at Peronne was offered to the [[United States Air Force]] by the French Air Ministry as part of their [[NATO]] commitment to establish a modern Air Force Base at the site.  NATO faced several problems when attempting to solve the air power survival equation. Planning for a [[Warsaw Pact]] first strike survival in both conventional and nuclear wars had to be considered. The main air bases were built on small parcels of land with very limited dispersal space. It was decided to use Peronne as an emergency \"backup\" airfield, known as [[Saint Quentin-Estres Air Base]], consisting of a \"bare bones\" facility of a runway with minimal facilities intended for use by all NATO air forces to disperse their aircraft in case of war.\n\nBeginning about 1954, French demolition companies returned to Peronne and began demolishing the structures and removing the wreckage of the World War II air base.  French Army Explosive demolition teams were brought in to safely remove unexploded ordnance remaining from the war and the site was prepared for construction.   A modern all-weather concrete NATO jet runway was laid down aligned 09/27 (east-west), with taxiways and dispersal areas for three fighter squadrons.  The dispersals were designed in a circular marguerite system of hardstands which could be revetted later with earth for added aircraft protection. Typically the marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands, with each hardstand capable of parking one or two aircraft, allowing the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex.\n\nOther than the occasional touch-and-go landing of NATO (USAF) aircraft, Peronne Air Base was never used.  With the French withdrawal from the integrated military component of NATO in 1967, the base was abandoned.<ref>McAuliffe, Jerome J (2005): U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967, Chapter 17, Dispersed Operating Bases</ref>\n\n===Return to civil use===\nWith the abandonment of the facility by NATO, the airfield was acquired by the local government and redeveloped into a commercial airport. The marguerite dispersal hardstands were torn up and sold for hardcore aggregate, with a small part of the 22 end of the old wartime runway was used for a parking ramp. A new terminal was erected and also small hangar for private aircraft.\n\nToday the NATO runway and taxiway are used by the airport, however, the runway has been shortened, with about half its length as the active airport runway. The wartime 04/22 still exists in a very deteriorated condition, unused.  It appears that much of the enclosing taxiway have been turned into agricultural roads.\n\n==Modern skydive activity==\nToday the skydiving dropzone of Paris is hosted here. Many skydiving clubs like Saut en Parachute Paris are using this dropzone for their activities. On a yearly basis, there are between 30.000 and 40.000 skydiving jumps, including tandem, PAC (the French [[Accelerated freefall|AFF]] course) and individual solo jumps.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n* [[Advanced Landing Ground#A-71 to A-80|Advanced Landing Ground]]\n\n==References==\n{{Air Force Historical Research Agency}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{GCM|LFAG}}\n*{{WAD|LFAG}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{USAAF 9th Air Force UK|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Airports in Hauts-de-France]]\n[[Category:World War II airfields in France]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in France]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aisne]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox airport\n| name         = Peronne-St Quentin Airport\n| nativename   = {{smaller|Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) A-72}}\n| nativename-a =\n| nativename-r =\n| image        =\n| image-width  =\n| caption      =\n| IATA         =  \n| ICAO         =  LFAG\n| FAA          =\n| LID          =\n| type         =\n| owner        =\n| operator     =\n| owner-oper   =\n| city-served  =\n| location     = Estress Mons, France\n| elevation-f  =  470\n| elevation-m  =  143\n| coordinates  = {{Coord|49|52|11|N|003|01|43|E}}\n| website      =\n\n| pushpin_map            = France\n| pushpin_mapsize        = 250\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location of Peronne-St Quentin Airport\n| pushpin_label          = '''LFAG'''\n| pushpin_label_position = bottom\n| built        =\n\n| metric-elev  =\n| metric-rwy   =\n| r1-number    = 09/27\n| r1-length-f  =  4560\n| r1-length-m  =  1390\n| r1-surface   =  Composite\n| stat-year    =\n| stat1-header =\n| stat1-data   =\n| stat2-header =\n| stat2-data   =\n| footnotes    =\n}}\n\n'''Peronne-St Quentin Airport''' {{airport codes||LFAG}} is a regional airport in [[France]], located {{convert|11|mi|km}} west of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]; {{convert|121|mi|km}} north of [[Paris]].
