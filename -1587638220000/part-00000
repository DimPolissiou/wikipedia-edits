Hindu, Buddhist, Tantric, and Islamic views that were current in medieval India come together in the wide-ranging literary spectrum of the GGS. The stereotypical oppositions between the Indic and Abrahamic worldviews of the day are transcended: \"Some call it Rama, some call it Khuda; some worship it as Vishnu, some as Allah\" (GGS: 885). Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139). Persian terminology is used to emphasize the unity of being: \"asti ek digari kui ek tui ek tui \u2014Only the One is, there is none other; Only you, you only\" (GGS: 144). Again, \"hindu turk ka sahib ek\u2014Hindus and Muslims share the One sovereign\" (GGS: 1158). (The term \"Turk\" referred to all Muslims in this period.) Since everything is a manifestation of That One being, all the manifestations would be a part of it.

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs, states Banga, were \"only 4 million out of a total of 28&nbsp;million in Punjab, and 6&nbsp;million out of nearly 400&nbsp;million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district\".{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Wolpert2010p9\">{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=India and Pakistan: Continued Conflict or Cooperation?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEvmBKPgBoC |year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94800-6|pages=9\u201312, 16\u201323}}</ref>\n\nWhen the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108\u2013111}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other.

The partition created the \"largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long\", states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly \"distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs\".

Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab.The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, \"have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or [[dalits]]; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.\" The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity.

Despite being very small in numbers, the Kshatriya [[Khatri]] and [[Arora]] castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community.

Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.\n\nSikhs also migrated to East Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia.

Hindu, Buddhist, Tantric, and Islamic views that were current in medieval India come together in the wide-ranging literary spectrum of the GGS. The stereotypical oppositions between the Indic and Abrahamic worldviews of the day are transcended: \"Some call it Rama, some call it Khuda; some worship it as Vishnu, some as Allah\" (GGS: 885). Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139). Persian terminology is used to emphasize the unity of being: \"asti ek digari kui ek tui ek tui \u2014Only the One is, there is none other; Only you, you only\" (GGS: 144). Again, \"hindu turk ka sahib ek\u2014Hindus and Muslims share the One sovereign\" (GGS: 1158). (The term \"Turk\" referred to all Muslims in this period.) Since everything is a manifestation of That One being, all the manifestations would be a part of it.

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs, states Banga, were \"only 4 million out of a total of 28&nbsp;million in Punjab, and 6&nbsp;million out of nearly 400&nbsp;million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district\".{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Wolpert2010p9\">{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=India and Pakistan: Continued Conflict or Cooperation?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEvmBKPgBoC |year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94800-6|pages=9\u201312, 16\u201323}}</ref>\n\nWhen the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108\u2013111}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other.

The partition created the \"largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long\", states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly \"distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs\".

{"title_page": "Black body", "text_new": "{{short description|Idealised physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation}}\n{{For| the radiation from a black body in thermal equilibrium|Black-body radiation}}\n\n[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|As the temperature of a black body decreases, its intensity also decreases and its peak moves to longer wavelengths. Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]]. The time taken for thermalization is much faster with condensed matter present than with rarefied matter such as a dilute gas.  At temperatures below billions of Kelvin, direct [[Euler\u2013Heisenberg Lagrangian|photon\u2013photon interactions]]<ref name=Karplus>Robert Karplus* and Maurice Neuman ,\"The Scattering of Light by Light\", Phys. Rev. 83, 776\u2013784 (1951)</ref> are usually negligible compared to interactions with matter.<ref name=Bergmann/> Photons are an example of an interacting [[boson]] gas,<ref name=boson/> and as described by the [[H-theorem]],<ref name=Tolman/> under very general conditions any interacting boson gas will approach thermal equilibrium.\n\n===Transmission, absorption, and reflection===\nA body's behavior with regard to thermal radiation is characterized by its transmission \u03c4, absorption \u03b1, and reflection \u03c1.\n \nThe boundary of a body forms an interface with its surroundings, and this interface may be rough or smooth. A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface. In that case, an according mathematical  condition has to be formulated on surface of black-body.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\">{{cite book |last1=Zakhariev  |last2=Lemanskii |first1=Aleksander A. |title=Scattering of Waves by 'Black' Bodies |date=1972 |publisher=Sovetskoje Radio, BBK: B343.132.0 |language=Russian |location=Moscow |pages=288}}</ref>\nAs to be known, [[impedance matching]] is effective for the only [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. In 1911, Macdonald H.M. proposed nearly self-evident approach.\n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=Hector Muaro |title=The Effect Produced by an Obstacle on a Train of Electric Waves (A Perfectly Absorbing Obstacle) |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |date=1912 |volume=212 |issue= |pages=484\u2013496 |doi=10.1098/rsta1913.0010 |doi-broken-date=2020-04-23 }}</ref> He used two well formulated problems in electrodynamics-  that of reflection from ideal metal:  \n: <math> \\mathbf E_{\\tau} = 0 </math>,\nand that of reflection from ideal magnetic:\n: <math> \\mathbf H_{\\tau} = 0 </math>.\nHalf-sum of solutions is the field around the black-body in  Macdonald's model. The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only. Diagrams of scattered \nfields around black ball for Macdonald's model are calculated on the base of Maxwell's equations in  monography.<ref name=\"Zakhariev\" />\n\n===Adjunct space===\nSommerfeld proposed to consider black flat screen as surface of continued space what is analogous to procedure in the theory of [[Argument|complex analysis]].

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only. It is clear that theoretical model needs a way for realizations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of electromagnetic waves by anisotropic medium ('Non-reflecting crystal model') |journal=Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics |date=1978 |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=916\u2013920 |doi=10.1007/BF01031726 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Efimov |first1=Sergei P. |title=Compression of waves by artificial anisotropic medium |journal=Acoustical Journal |date=1979 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=234\u2013238 |url=http://www.akzh.ru/pdf/1979_2_234-238.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThe concept of adjunct space can be applied to the [[Black-hole|black hole]] in theory of [[General relativity| gravitation]].

As to be known, it is [[Inversion in a sphere|inversion in sphere]].  Radius <math> a </math> is taken to give the  Schwarzschild metrics again:\n:<math> a =\\frac{r^s}{4} </math>.\nTherefore, the black hole can be considered as the connection of two symmetrical spaces on the surface of ball of radius <math> a </math>. Adjunct space has the same Schwarzschild metrics.

Regarding physical picture, adjunct space now is simply  the surrounding space as far as the walls are missed. Therefore, adjunct spaces for the totally convex surface and  concave one are identical. The adjunct space is continued along normal directed into side of convexity of surface. Details are described in the paper. <ref name=\"Efimov\"/> The equivalent electrodynamical problem can be formulated on the base of boundary condition. It analogous to the impedance matching. Nevertheless, the boundary condition binds tangential components of electric and magnet fields not in the point but on all surface. The condition is based on [[Fourier optics|Stratton - Chu formula]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stratton |first=J. A. |last2=Chu |first2=L.

Here are a few.\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nIn 1898, [[Otto Lummer]] and [[Ferdinand Kurlbaum]] published an account of their cavity radiation source.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1898}}</ref> Their design has been used largely unchanged for radiation measurements to the present day. It was a hole in the wall of a platinum box, divided by diaphragms, with its interior blackened with iron oxide. It was an important ingredient for the progressively improved measurements that led to the discovery of Planck's law.<ref name=Rechenberg/><ref>{{harvnb|Kangro|1976|page=159}}</ref> A version described in 1901 had its interior blackened with a mixture of chromium, nickel, and cobalt oxides.<ref>{{harvnb|Lummer|Kurlbaum|1901}}</ref> See also [[Hohlraum]].\n\n===Near-black materials===\nThere is interest in blackbody-like materials for [[camouflage]] and [[radar-absorbent material]]s for radar invisibility.<ref name=Lewis/><ref name=Quinn/> They also have application as solar energy collectors, and infrared thermal detectors. As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or in a vacuum where convective heating is unavailable.<ref name=Mizuno/> They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light that comes from the wrong sources.\n\nIt has long been known that a [[lamp-black]] coating will make a body nearly black. An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]]. This absorbs between 98% and 99% of the incoming light in the spectral range from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared regions.<ref name=Mizuno/>\n\nOther examples of nearly perfect black materials are [[super black]], prepared by chemically etching a [[nickel]]\u2013[[phosphorus]] [[alloy]],<ref name=Brown/> [[vertically aligned carbon nanotube arrays]] and flower carbon nanostructures;<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1021/acsanm.9b01950|title = Dandelion-Like Carbon Nanotubes for Near-Perfect Black Surfaces|year = 2019|last1 = Ghai|first1 = Viney|last2 = Singh|first2 = Harpreet|last3 = Agnihotri|first3 = Prabhat K.|journal = ACS Applied Nano Materials|volume = 2|issue = 12|pages = 7951\u20137956}}</ref> all absorb 99.9% of light or more.\n\n===Stars and planets===\n{{For| more about the UBV color index|Photometric system}}\n\n[[File:Idealized photosphere.png|thumb|An idealized view of the cross-section of a star. The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return. It is called \"black\" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, making it almost an ideal black body<ref name=Schutz/> (radiation with a wavelength equal to or larger than the diameter of the hole may not be absorbed, so black holes are not perfect black bodies).<ref name=Davies/> Physicists believe that to an outside observer, black holes have a non-zero temperature and emit radiation with a nearly perfect [[black-body radiation|black-body]] spectrum, ultimately [[Black hole#Evaporation|evaporating]].<ref name=Wald/> The mechanism for this emission is related to [[vacuum fluctuations]] in which a [[virtual particles|virtual pair]] of particles is separated by the gravity of the hole, one member being sucked into the hole, and the other being emitted.<ref name=Carr/> The energy distribution of emission is described by [[Planck's law]] with a temperature ''T'':\n:<math>T=\\frac {\\hbar c^3}{8\\pi Gk_BM} \\ ,</math>\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], \u210f is the [[reduced Planck constant]], ''k<sub>B</sub>'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and ''M'' is the mass of the black hole.<ref name=Frolov/> These predictions have not yet been tested either observationally or experimentally.<ref name=Wald2/>\n\n===Cosmic microwave background radiation===\n{{See also|Big Bang|Cosmic microwave background radiation}}\nThe big bang theory is based upon the [[cosmological principle]], which states that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.  According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.  It departs from the perfect isotropy of true black-body radiation by an observed anisotropy that varies with angle on the sky only to about one part in 100,000.\n\n==Radiative cooling==\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's displacement law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{See also|Radiative cooling|Radiosity (heat transfer)}}\nThe integration of [[Planck's law]] over all frequencies provides the total energy per unit of time per unit of surface area radiated by a black body maintained at a temperature ''T'', and is known as the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]:\n:<math>P/A = \\sigma T^4 \\ , </math>\nwhere ''&sigma;'' is the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant]], {{nowrap|''&sigma;'' &asymp; 5.67 &times; 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> W/(m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>).<ref name=NIST/>}} To remain in thermal equilibrium at constant temperature ''T'', the black body must absorb or internally generate this amount of [[power (physics)|power]] P over the given area A.\n\nThe cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law supplemented with a \"gray body\" [[emissivity]] {{nowrap|''&epsilon; \u2264 1''}}  {{nowrap|(''P/A'' <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''&epsilon;&sigma;T''<sup>4</sup>).}}  The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's [[heat capacity]].<ref name=Pearson/> This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, [[phase transition]]s or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,<ref name=Vollmer/><ref name=Champion/> and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.<ref name=Shifman/>\n\nIf a hot emitting body is assumed to follow the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law and its power emission ''P'' and temperature ''T'' are known, this law can be used to estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10&nbsp;km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured.<ref name=Lewin/> An accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and angular dependence.<ref name=Mason/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation]]\n* [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n* [[Vantablack]], a substance produced in 2014 and the blackest known\n* [[Planckian locus]], black body incandescence in a given chromaticity space\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Adkins\">\n{{cite book |author=Clement John Adkins |chapter=\u00a74.1 The function of the second law |title=Equilibrium thermodynamics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FW4Oz48TWwQC&pg=PA50 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-521-27456-2 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Aller>\n{{cite book |title=Atoms, stars, and nebulae |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HupvoeJDCGoC&pg=PA61 |page=61 |author=Lawrence Hugh Aller |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-31040-6 |edition=3rd |year=1991}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=Batrouni>\nIn simple cases the approach to equilibrium is governed by a [[relaxation time]].

Shown for comparison is the classical [[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]] and its [[ultraviolet catastrophe]].]]\n\nA '''black body''' or '''blackbody''' is an idealized [[physical object|physical body]] that [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbs]] all incident [[electromagnetic radiation]], regardless of frequency or [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]. (It does not ''only'' absorb radiation, but can also ''emit'' radiation. The name \"black body\" is given because it absorbs radiation in all frequencies, not because it only absorbs.)  A '''white body''' is one with a \"rough surface that reflects all incident rays completely and uniformly in all directions.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310}}</ref>\n\nA black body in [[thermal equilibrium]] (that is, at a constant temperature) emits electromagnetic radiation called [[black-body radiation]]. The radiation is emitted according to [[Planck's law]], meaning that it has a [[frequency spectrum|spectrum]] that is determined by the [[temperature]] alone (see figure at right), not by the body's shape or composition.\n\nAn ideal black body in thermal equilibrium has two notable properties:<ref name=Massoud/>\n#It is an ideal emitter: at every frequency, it emits as much or more thermal radiative energy as any other body at the same temperature.\n#It is a diffuse emitter: measured per unit area perpendicular to the direction, the energy is radiated [[Isotropic radiator|isotropically]], independent of direction.\n\nAn approximate realization of a black surface is a hole in the wall of a large insulated enclosure (an [[oven]], for example). Any light entering the hole is reflected or absorbed at the internal surfaces of the body and is unlikely to re-emerge, making the hole a nearly perfect absorber. When the radiation confined in such an enclosure is in thermal equilibrium, the radiation emitted from the hole will be as great as from any body at that equilibrium temperature.\n\nReal materials emit energy at a fraction\u2014called the [[emissivity]]\u2014of black-body energy levels. By definition, a black body in thermal equilibrium has an emissivity of {{nowrap|''&epsilon;'' {{=}} 1}}. A source with lower emissivity independent of frequency often is referred to as a '''gray body'''.<ref name=emissivity/><ref name=gray_body/>\nConstruction of black bodies with emissivity as close to one as possible remains a topic of current interest.<ref name=Chun/>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], the radiation from [[star]]s and [[planet]]s is sometimes characterized in terms of an [[effective temperature]], the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total flux of electromagnetic energy.\n\n==Definition==\nThe idea of a black body originally was introduced by [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] in 1860 as follows:\n{{blockquote|...the supposition that bodies can be imagined which, for infinitely small thicknesses, completely absorb all incident rays, and neither reflect nor transmit any. I shall call such bodies ''perfectly black'', or, more briefly, ''black bodies''.<ref name=Kirchhoff/>}}\n\nA more modern definition drops the reference to \"infinitely small thicknesses\":<ref name=infinitesimal/>\n{{blockquote|An ideal body is now defined, called a ''blackbody''. A ''blackbody'' allows ''all'' incident radiation to pass into it (no reflected energy) and internally absorbs ''all'' the incident radiation (no energy transmitted through the body). This is true for radiation of all wavelengths and for all angles of incidence. Hence the blackbody is ''a perfect absorber for all incident radiation.''<ref name=Siegel/>}}\n\n==Idealizations==\nThis section describes some concepts developed in connection with black bodies.\n\n[[File:Black_body_realization.svg|thumb|An approximate realization of a black body as a tiny hole in an insulated enclosure]]\n\n===Cavity with a hole===\nA widely used model of a black surface is a small hole in a cavity with walls that are opaque to radiation.<ref name=Siegel/>  Radiation incident on the hole will pass into the cavity, and is very unlikely to be re-emitted if the cavity is large.  The hole is not quite a perfect black surface \u2014 in particular, if the wavelength of the incident radiation is greater than the diameter of the hole, part will be reflected.  Similarly, even in perfect thermal equilibrium, the radiation inside a finite-sized cavity will not have an ideal Planck spectrum for wavelengths comparable to or larger than the size of the cavity.<ref name=Zee/>\n\nSuppose the cavity is held at a fixed temperature ''T'' and the radiation trapped inside the enclosure is at [[thermal equilibrium]] with the enclosure. The hole in the enclosure will allow some radiation to escape. If the hole is small, radiation passing in and out of the hole has negligible effect upon the equilibrium of the radiation inside the cavity. This escaping radiation will approximate [[black-body radiation]] that exhibits a distribution in energy characteristic of the temperature ''T'' and does not depend upon the properties of the cavity or the hole, at least for wavelengths smaller than the size of the hole.<ref name=Zee/> See the figure in the Introduction for the [[Frequency spectrum#Light|spectrum]] as a function of the [[Frequency spectrum|frequency]] of the radiation, which is related to the energy of the radiation by the equation ''E''=''hf'', with ''E'' = energy, ''h'' = [[Planck constant|Planck's constant]], ''f'' = frequency.\n\nAt any given time the radiation in the cavity may not be in thermal equilibrium, but [[laws of thermodynamics|the second law of thermodynamics]] states that if left undisturbed it will eventually reach equilibrium,<ref name=\"Adkins\"/> although the time it takes to do so may be very long.<ref name=Batrouni/> Typically, equilibrium is reached by continual absorption and emission of radiation by material in the cavity or its walls.<ref name=Landsberg/><ref name=\"Planck 1914 44\">{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=44, \u00a752}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Loudon|2000}}, Chapter 1</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mandel|Wolf|1995}}, Chapter 13</ref> Radiation entering the cavity will be \"[[H-theorem|thermalized]]\" by this mechanism: the energy will be redistributed until the ensemble of photons achieves a [[Planck's law|Planck distribution]].

A nonreflecting interface separating regions with different refractive indices must be rough, because the laws of reflection and refraction governed by the [[Fresnel equations]] for a smooth interface require a reflected ray when the refractive indices of the material and its surroundings differ.<ref name=Tipler/> A few idealized types of behavior are given particular names:\n\nAn opaque body is one that transmits none of the radiation that reaches it, although some may be reflected.<ref name=Kaviany/><ref name=Venkanna/> That is, \u03c4=0 and \u03b1+\u03c1=1\n\nA transparent body is one that transmits all the radiation that reaches it. That is, \u03c4=1 and \u03b1=\u03c1=0.\n\nA grey body is one where \u03b1, \u03c1 and \u03c4 are uniform for all wavelengths. This term also is used to mean a body for which \u03b1 is temperature and wavelength independent.\n\nA white body is one for which all incident radiation is reflected uniformly in all directions: \u03c4=0, \u03b1=0, and \u03c1=1.\n\nFor a black body, \u03c4=0, \u03b1=1, and \u03c1=0. Planck offers a theoretical model for perfectly black bodies, which he noted do not exist in nature: besides their opaque interior, they have interfaces that are perfectly transmitting and non-reflective.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|page=10}}</ref>\n\n===Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies===\nKirchhoff in 1860 introduced the theoretical concept of a perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (i) allow radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon [[scattering]] to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body that are difficult to satisfy.<ref>{{harvnb|Planck|1914|pages=9\u201310, \u00a710}}</ref><ref name=\"Kirchhoff 1860c\">{{harvnb|Kirchhoff|1860c}}</ref>\n\n== Black-body in the theory of diffraction ==\n=== Macdonald's model  ===\nThe concept of black-body was formulated initially for  size of it to be much less than the wave length. To say about diffraction, the method of [[geometrical optics]] is valid then. To apply the Plank law for emitting of black body one has to regard  the restriction: \n:<math> \\lambda \\ll\\ L </math>,\nwhere <math> L </math> is the characteristic size of object. In 20-th age, the series of attempts was taken to find approach  that is valid for any wave length - similar to ideal reflecting surface.

The approach is clear in the scope of the geometrical optics. Two reflected rays have equal amplitudes of opposite signs and cancel each other. Therefore, the convex surface does not reflect rays at all.\nAt the same time, surface having convex and concave parts of that allows double reflections. The second reflections have equal amplitudes of two rays what does not accord to black-body concept. Consequently, Macdonald's model is reasonable for the convex surface only.

Actually, two problems are considered outside of the surface. One is with charges and currents, other is without that. Boundary conditions on the surface equate  tangential components of electric and magnetic fields of two  problems to each other with changing sign of the magnetic component. (In scalar problem, potentials are equal on the surface when their derivatives are differed by sign.)   In such a way, electric field in physical space is equal to half-sum of solutions of two problems for ideal reflecting surfaces:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ +\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in physical space),\nwhere <math> \\mathbf E_+ </math> is field from problem for ideal metal and <math> \\mathbf E_- </math> is the field from problem for ideal magnetic. In the adjunct space, where no charges and currents, the sought electric field is equal to the difference of the same fields:\n:<math> \\mathbf E= \\frac{(\\,\\mathbf E_+ -\\mathbf E_-)}{2} \\qquad </math>   (in adjunct space).\nThe concept of adjunct space proves that Macdonald's model is physically correct for all frequencies. The causality holds in the approach and considerations of scattering of wave packs is acceptable.\nFrom symmetry of physical anf adjunct spaces follows two electrodynamical theorems:\n* In state of the heat equilibrium, heat fluxes from surface in physical and adjunct spaces are equal to each other.\n* Scattered field from thin black disc is equal to that from hole in flat thin screen (Babinet's principle).\nMacdonald's  model and Efimov's consideration are valid for   equations of acoustics, to equations of hydrodynamics and for diffusion equation.  It should be noticed that half-sum of two subsidiary solutions as a solution of the problem is valid for linear equations only.

An improvement on lamp-black is found in manufactured [[carbon nanotube]]s. Nano-porous materials can achieve [[refractive indices]] nearly that of vacuum, in one case obtaining average reflectance of 0.045%.<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Yang/> In 2009, a team of Japanese scientists created a material called nanoblack which is close to an ideal black body, based on vertically aligned single-walled [[carbon nanotubes]].

The [[photosphere]] contains [[photon]]s of light nearly in thermal equilibrium, and some escape into space as near-black-body radiation. ]]\n\nA star or planet often is modeled as a black body, and electromagnetic radiation emitted from these bodies as [[black-body radiation]]. The figure shows a highly schematic cross-section to illustrate the idea. The [[photosphere]] of the star, where the emitted light is generated, is idealized as a layer within which the photons of light interact with the material in the photosphere and achieve a common temperature ''T'' that is maintained over a long period of time. Some photons escape and are emitted into space, but the energy they carry away is replaced by energy from within the star, so that the temperature of the photosphere is nearly steady. Changes in the core lead to changes in the supply of energy to the photosphere, but such changes are slow on the time scale of interest here. Assuming these circumstances can be realized, the outer layer of the star is somewhat analogous to the example of an enclosure with a small hole in it, with the hole replaced by the limited transmission into space at the outside of the photosphere. With all these assumptions in place, the star emits black-body radiation at the temperature of the photosphere.<ref name=Green/>\n\n[[File:Effective temperature and color index.png|thumb|Effective temperature of a black body compared with the B-V and U-B color index of main sequence and super giant stars in what is called a [[color-color diagram]].<ref name=UBV/>]]\n\nUsing this model the [[effective temperature]] of stars is estimated, defined as the temperature of a black body that yields the same surface flux of energy as the star. If a star were a black body, the same effective temperature would result from any region of the spectrum. For example, comparisons in the ''B'' (blue) or ''V'' (visible) range lead to the so-called ''B-V'' [[color index]], which increases the redder the star,<ref name=Kelley/> with the Sun having an index of +0.648 \u00b1 0.006.<ref name=Gray/> Combining the ''U'' (ultraviolet) and the ''B'' indices leads to the ''U-B'' index, which becomes more negative the hotter the star and the more the UV radiation. Assuming the Sun is a type G2 V star, its ''U-B'' index is +0.12.<ref name=Golay/> The two indices for two types of most common star sequences are compared in the figure (diagram) with the effective surface temperature of the stars if they were perfect black bodies. There is a rough correlation. For example, for a given ''B-V'' index measurement, the curves of both most common sequences of star (the main sequence and the supergiants) lie below the corresponding black-body ''U-B'' index that includes the ultraviolet spectrum, showing that both groupings of star emit less ultraviolet light than a black body with the same ''B-V'' index. It is perhaps surprising that they fit a black body curve as well as they do, considering that stars have greatly different temperatures at different depths.<ref name=Aller/> For example, the [[Sun]] has an effective temperature of 5780 K,<ref name=Lang/> which can be compared to the temperature of its [[photosphere]] (the region generating the light), which ranges from about 5000 K at its outer boundary with the [[chromosphere]] to about 9500 K at its inner boundary with the [[convection zone]] approximately {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name=Bertotti/>\n\n===Black holes===\n{{See also|Hawking radiation}}\nA [[black hole]] is a region of [[spacetime]] from which nothing escapes. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an [[event horizon]] that marks the point of no return.

According to theory, the Universe approximately a second after its formation was a near-ideal black body in thermal equilibrium at a temperature above 10<sup>10</sup> K. The temperature decreased as the Universe expanded and the matter and radiation in it cooled.  The cosmic microwave background radiation observed today is \"the most perfect black body ever measured in nature\".<ref name=White/> It has a nearly ideal Planck spectrum at a temperature of about 2.7&thinsp;K.
