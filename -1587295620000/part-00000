Following the [[Fall of France]], [[Adolf Hitler]], the German [[F\u00fchrer]] and [[Commander-in-chief|Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces]], hoped the British government would seek a peace agreement and he reluctantly considered invasion only as a last resort if all other options failed. \n\nHowever, once Hitler had determined that Germany would invade the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, the desirability of forcing Britain out of the war before that date increased the attractiveness of an invasion, as potentially offering a quick and decisive victory in the West. As a precondition, Hitler specified the achievement of both [[air superiority|air]] and [[naval superiority]] over the [[English Channel]] and the proposed landing sites, but the German forces did not achieve either at any point during the war, and both [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|the German High Command]] and Hitler himself had serious doubts about the prospects for success. Nevertheless, both the German Army and Navy undertook a major programme of preparations for an invasion: training troops, developing specialised weapons and equipment, and modifying transport vessels. A large number of river barges and transport ships were gathered together on the Channel coast, but with Luftwaffe aircraft losses increasing in the Battle of Britain and no sign that the Royal Air Force had been defeated, Hitler postponed Sea Lion indefinitely on 17 September 1940 and it was never put into action.\n\n== Background ==\nAdolf Hitler hoped for a negotiated peace with the UK and made no preparations for [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on Britain until the Fall of France. At the time, the only forces with experience of, or modern equipment for, such landings were the Japanese, at the [[Battle of Wuhan]] in 1938.{{sfn|Deighton|1996|pp=23\u201326}}\n\n=== Outbreak of war and fall of Poland ===\nIn September 1939, the German [[invasion of Poland]] was a success, but this infringed on both [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|a French]] and [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|a British]] alliance with Poland and both countries declared war on Germany. On 9 October, Hitler's \"Directive No. 6 for the Conduct of the War\" planned an offensive to defeat these allies and \"win as much territory as possible in Holland, Belgium, and northern France to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England\".<ref name=\"Directive 6\">{{harvnb | Murray | 2002 | pp=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-2.html#fn28 32\u201333, 35]}}, [http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/06.html Directive No. 6 for the Conduct of the War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729073651/http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/06.html |date=29 July 2016 }}, Berlin, 9 October 1939</ref>\n\nWith the prospect of the Channel ports falling under ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German Navy) control, Grand Admiral (''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'') [[Erich Raeder]] (head of the ''Kriegsmarine'') attempted to anticipate the obvious next step that might entail and instructed his operations officer, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See|Kapit\u00e4n]]'' [[Hansj\u00fcrgen Reinicke]], to draw up a document examining \"the possibility of troop landings in England should the future progress of the war make the problem arise\". Reinicke spent five days on this study and set forth the following prerequisites:\n* Eliminating or sealing off [[Royal Navy]] forces from the landing and approach areas.\n* Eliminating the [[Royal Air Force]].\n* Destroying all Royal Navy units in the coastal zone.\n* Preventing [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|British submarine]] action against the landing fleet.<ref name=Ansel43>Ansel, p.43</ref>\nOn 22 November 1939, the Head of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German Air Force) intelligence [[Joseph Schmid|Joseph \"Beppo\" Schmid]] presented his \"Proposal for the Conduct of Air Warfare\", which argued for a [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|counter to the British blockade]] and said \"Key is to paralyse the British trade\" by blocking imports to Britain and attacking seaports. The OKW (''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' or \"High Command of the Armed Forces\") considered the options and Hitler's 29 November \"Directive No. 9 \u2013 Instructions For Warfare Against The Economy of the Enemy\" stated that once the coast had been secured, the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Kriegsmarine'' were to [[blockade]] UK ports with sea mines, attack shipping and warships, and make air attacks on shore installations and industrial production.

The paper outlined an assault on England's eastern coast between [[The Wash]] and the [[River Thames]] by troops crossing the [[North Sea]] from ports in the [[Low Countries]]. It suggested airborne troops as well as seaborne landings of 100,000 infantry in [[East Anglia]], transported by the ''Kriegsmarine'', which was also to prevent Royal Navy ships from getting through the Channel, while the ''Luftwaffe'' had to control airspace over the landings. The ''Kriegsmarine'' response was focused on pointing out the many difficulties to be surmounted if invading England was to be a viable option. It could not envisage taking on the Royal Navy [[Home Fleet]] and said it would take a year to organise shipping for the troops. ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], head of the ''Luftwaffe'', responded with a single-page letter in which he stated, \"[A] combined operation having the objective of landing in England must be rejected. It could only be the final act of an already victorious war against Britain as otherwise the preconditions for success of a combined operation would not be met\".<ref name=Ansel47-49>Ansel, pp.47\u201349</ref>{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n=== The fall of France ===\nGermany's swift and successful [[Battle of France|occupation of France and the Low Countries]] gained control of the Channel coast, facing what Schmid's 1939 report called their \"most dangerous enemy\". Raeder met Hitler on 21 May 1940 and raised the topic of invasion, but warned of the risks and expressed a preference for [[blockade]] by air, submarines and [[Commerce raiding|raiders]].{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=31\u201333}}{{sfn| Overy | 2013 | pp=68\u201369}}\n\nBy the end of May, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had become even more opposed to invading Britain following its costly victory in [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]]; after [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' had only one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, and four destroyers available for operations.<ref>Murray, Williamson & Millet, Alan ''A War To Be Won'' (Harvard: Belknap Press, 2000), p.66.</ref> Raeder was strongly opposed to Sea Lion, for over half of ''Kriegsmarine'' surface fleet had been either sunk or badly damaged in ''Weser\u00fcbung'', and his service was hopelessly outnumbered by the ships of the Royal Navy.<ref>Murray & Millet, p.84.</ref> British parliamentarians still arguing for peace negotiations were defeated in the [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis]], but throughout July the Germans continued with attempts to find a diplomatic solution.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|pp=9\u201313}}\n\n=== Invasion planning ===\nIn a report presented on 30 June, OKW Chief of Staff [[Alfred Jodl]] reviewed options to increase pressure on Britain to agree to a negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the [[Royal Air Force]] and gain [[air supremacy]]. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air and the British economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike (\"''Todesstoss''\") after England had already been practically defeated, but could have a quick result.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=31\u201333}}{{sfn | Murray | 2002 | pp=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-2.html#cn76 44\u201345]}} At a meeting that day, OKH Chief of General Staff [[Franz Halder]] heard from Secretary of State [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]] that Hitler had turned his attention to Russia. Halder met Admiral [[Otto Schniewind]] on 1 July, and they shared views without understanding each other's position. Both thought that air superiority was needed first, and could make the invasion unnecessary. They agreed that minefields and U-boats could limit the threat posed by the Royal Navy; Schniewind emphasised the significance of weather conditions.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=110}}\n\nOn 2 July, the OKW asked the services to start preliminary planning for an invasion, as Hitler had concluded that invasion would be achievable in certain conditions, the first of which was command of the air, and specifically asked the ''Luftwaffe'' when this would be achieved. On 4 July, after asking General [[Erich Marcks]] to begin planning an attack on Russia, Halder heard from the ''Luftwaffe'' that they planned to eliminate the RAF, destroying its aircraft manufacturing and supply systems, with damage to naval forces as a secondary aim. A ''Luftwaffe'' report presented to the OKW at a meeting on 11 July said that it would take 14 to 28 days to achieve air superiority. The meeting also heard that England was discussing an agreement with Russia. On the same day, Grand Admiral Raeder visited Hitler at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] to persuade him that the best way to pressure the British into a peace agreement would be a siege combining air and submarine attacks. Hitler agreed with him that invasion would be a last resort.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nJodl set out the OKW proposals for the proposed invasion in a memorandum issued on 12 July, which described operation L\u00f6we (Lion) as \"a river crossing on a broad front\", irritating the ''Kriegsmarine''. On 13 July, Hitler met Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch|von Brauchitsch]] and Halder at [[Berchtesgaden]] and they presented detailed plans prepared by the army on the assumption that the navy would provide safe transport.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p= 111}} To the surprise of Von Brauchitsch and Halder, and completely at odds with his normal practice, Hitler did not ask any questions about specific operations, had no interest in details, and made no recommendations to improve the plans; instead he simply told OKW to start preparations.{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=105}}\n\n==== Directive No. 16: Operation Sea Lion ====\nOn 16 July 1940 Hitler issued [[F\u00fchrer Directive]] No. 16, setting in motion preparations for a landing in Britain. He prefaced the order by stating: \"As England, in spite of her hopeless military situation, still shows no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided to prepare, and if necessary to carry out, a landing operation against her. The aim of this operation is to eliminate the English Motherland as a base from which the war against Germany can be continued, and, if necessary, to occupy the country completely.\" The code name for the invasion was ''Seel\u00f6we'', \"Sea Lion\".<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 16\">{{cite web\n| title       = Directive No. 16 \u2013 On preparations for a landing operation against England\n| place       = F\u00fchrer Headquarters\n| date        = 16 July 1940\n| url         = http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_16.htm\n| accessdate  = 11 February 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194212/http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_16.htm\n| archivedate = 3 March 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=Cox159>Cox, p.159</ref>\n\nHitler's directive set four conditions for the invasion to occur:<ref name=Cox160>Cox, p.160</ref>\n* The RAF was to be \"beaten down in its morale and in fact, that it can no longer display any appreciable aggressive force in opposition to the German crossing\".\n* The English Channel was to be swept of British mines at the crossing points, and the [[Strait of Dover]] must be blocked at both ends by German mines.\n* The coastal zone between occupied France and England must be dominated by heavy artillery.\n* The [[Royal Navy]] must be sufficiently engaged in the [[North Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] so that it could not intervene in the crossing. British home squadrons must be damaged or destroyed by air and torpedo attacks.\n\nThis ultimately placed responsibility for Sea Lion{{'}}s success squarely on the shoulders of Raeder and G\u00f6ring, neither of whom had the slightest enthusiasm for the venture and, in fact, did little to hide their opposition to it.<ref name=Cox157>Cox, p.157</ref> Nor did Directive 16 provide for a combined operational headquarters, similar to the Allies' creation of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) for the later Normandy landings, under which all three service branches (Army, Navy, and Air Force) could work together to plan, co-ordinate, and execute such a complex undertaking.<ref name=Cox161>Cox, p.161</ref>\n\nThe invasion was to be on a broad front, from around [[Ramsgate]] to beyond the [[Isle of Wight]].\nPreparations, including overcoming the RAF, were to be in place by mid August.<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 16\" />{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n==== Discussion ====\nGrand Admiral Raeder sent a memorandum to OKW on 19 July, complaining about the onus placed on the navy in relation to the army and air force, and stating that the navy would be unable to achieve its objectives.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=111}}\n\nThe first joint services conference on the proposed invasion was held by Hitler in Berlin on 21 July, with Raeder, Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch|von Brauchitsch]], and ''Luftwaffe'' Chief of Staff [[Hans Jeschonnek]]. Hitler told them that the British had no hope of survival, and ought to negotiate, but were hoping to get Russia to intervene and halt German oil supplies. Invasion was very risky, and he asked them if direct attacks by air and submarine could take effect by mid September. Jeschonnek proposed large bombing attacks so that responding RAF fighters could be shot down. The idea that invasion could be a surprise \"river crossing\" was dismissed by Raeder, and the navy could not complete its preparations by mid August. Hitler wanted the air attack to commence early in August and, if it succeeded, the invasion was to start around 25 August before weather deteriorated. Hitler's main interest was the question of countering potential Russian intervention. Halder outlined his first thoughts on defeating Russian forces. Detailed plans were to be made to [[Operation Barbarossa|attack the Soviet Union]].{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nRaeder met Hitler on 25 July to report on navy progress: they were not sure if preparations could be completed during August: he was to present plans at a conference on 31 July. On 28 July he told OKW that ten days would be needed to get the first wave of troops across the Channel, even on a much narrower front. Planning was to resume. In his diary, [[Franz Halder|Halder]] noted that if what Raeder had said was true, \"all previous statements by the navy were so much rubbish and we can throw away the whole plan of invasion\". On the next day, Halder dismissed the navy's claims and required a new plan.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=113}}<ref>Burdick and Jacobsen 1988, p. 255.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' announced on 29 July that they could begin a major air attack at the start of August, and their intelligence reports gave them confidence of a decisive result. Half of their bombers were to be kept in reserve to support the invasion. At a meeting with the army, the navy proposed delay until May 1941, when the new battleships [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] would be ready. A navy memorandum issued on 30 July said invasion would be vulnerable to the Royal Navy, and autumn weather could prevent necessary maintenance of supplies. The OKW assessed alternatives, including attacking the British in the Mediterranean, and favoured extended operations against England while remaining on good terms with Russia.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=113}}\n\nAt the Berghof conference on 31 July, the ''Luftwaffe'' were not represented. Raeder said barge conversions would take until 15 September, leaving the only possible 1940 invasion dates as 22\u201326 September, when weather was likely to be unsuitable. Landings would have to be on a narrow front, and would be better in spring 1941. Hitler wanted the invasion in September as the British army was increasing in strength. After Raeder left, Hitler told von Brauchitsch and Halder that the air attack was to start around 5 August; eight to fourteen days after that, he would decide on the landing operation. London was showing new-found optimism, and he attributed this to their hopes of intervention by Russia, which Germany was to attack in the spring of 1941.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n==== Directive No. 17: air and sea warfare against England ====\n{{Main|Adlertag}}\nOn 1 August 1940, Hitler instructed intensified air and sea warfare to \"establish the necessary conditions for the final conquest of England\". From 5 August, subject to weather delays, the ''Luftwaffe'' was \"to overpower the English Air Force with all the forces at its command, in the shortest possible time.\" Attacks were then to be made on ports and food stocks, while leaving alone ports to be used in the invasion, and \"air attacks on enemy warships and merchant ships may be reduced except where some particularly favourable target happens to present itself.\" The ''Luftwaffe'' was to keep sufficient forces in reserve for the proposed invasion, and was not to target civilians without a direct order from Hitler in response to RAF terror bombing. No decision had been reached on the choice between immediate decisive action and a siege. The Germans hoped the air action would force the British to negotiate, and make invasion unnecessary.<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 17\">{{cite web\n| title       = Directive No. 17 \u2013 For the conduct of air and sea warfare against England\n| place       = F\u00fchrer Headquarters\n| date        = 1 August 1940\n| url         = http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_17.htm\n| accessdate  = 11 February 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201904/http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_17.htm\n| archivedate = 3 March 2016\n}}</ref>{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=114}}\n\n== Land forces ==\n{{Main|Operation Sea Lion order of battle}}\nIn the Army plan of 25 July 1940, the invasion force was to be organised into two [[army group]]s drawn from the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]], the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] and the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]]. The first wave of the landing would have consisted of eleven [[infantry]] and [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], the second wave of eight [[Panzer division|panzer]] and [[motorised infantry]] divisions and finally, the third wave was formed of six further infantry divisions. The initial assault would have also included two [[Airborne forces|airborne]] divisions and the [[special forces]] of the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThis initial plan was vetoed by opposition from both the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe, who successfully argued that an amphibious force could only be assured air and naval protection if confined to a narrow front, and that the landing areas should be as far from Royal Navy bases as possible. The definitive order of battle adopted on 30 August 1940 envisaged a first wave of nine divisions from the 9th and 16th armies landing along four stretches of beach \u2014 two infantry divisions on beach 'B' between [[Folkestone]] and [[New Romney]] supported by a [[special forces]] company of the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]], two infantry divisions on beach 'C' between [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Hastings]] supported by three battalions of submersible/floating tanks, two infantry divisions on beach 'D' between [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] and [[Eastbourne]] supported by one battalion of submersible/floating tanks and a second company of the Brandenburg Regiment, and three infantry divisions on beach 'E' between [[Beachy Head]] and [[Brighton]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2014|p=315}} A single airborne division would land in Kent north of [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]; with the objective of seizing the aerodrome at [[RAF Lympne|Lympne]] and bridge-crossings over the [[Royal Military Canal]], and in assisting the ground forces in capturing [[Folkestone]].  Folkestone (to the east) and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] (to the west) were the only cross-channel port facilities that would have been accessible to the invasion forces; and much depended on these being captured substantially intact or with the capability of rapid repair; in which case the second wave of eight divisions (including all the motorised and armoured divisions) might be unloaded directly onto their respective quaysides. A further six infantry divisions were allocated to the third wave.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=63}}\n\nThe order of battle defined on 30 August remained as the agreed overall plan, but was always considered as potentially subject to change if circumstances demanded it.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=66}} The Army High Command continued to press for a wider landing area if possible, against the opposition of the Kriegsmarine; in August they had won the concession that, if the opportunity arose, a force might be landed directly from ships onto the seafront at Brighton, perhaps supported by a second airborne force landing on the South Downs.  Contrariwise, the Kriegsmarine (fearful of possible fleet action against the invasion forces from Royal Navy ships in Portsmouth) insisted that the divisions enshipped from [[Cherbourg]] and [[Le Harvre]] for landing on beach 'E', might be diverted to any one of the other beaches where sufficient space allowed.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=247}}\n\nEach of the first wave landing forces was divided into three echelons. The first echelon, carried across the Channel on barges, coasters and small motor launches, would consist of the main infantry assault force. The second echelon, carried across the Channel in larger transport vessels, would consist predominantly of artillery, armoured vehicles and other heavy equipment. The third echelon, carried across the channel on barges, would consist of the vehicles, horses, stores and personnel of the division-level support services.  Loading of barges and transports with heavy equipment, vehicles and stores would start on S-tag minus nine (in Antwerp); and S minus eight in Dunkirk, with horses not loaded till S minus two. All troops would be loaded onto their barges from French or Belgian ports on S minus two or S minus one.  The first echelon would land on the beaches on S-tag itself, preferably at daybreak around two hours after high tide.  The barges used for the first echelon would be retrieved by tugs on the afternoon of S-tag, and those still in working order would be drawn up alongside the transport vessels to trans-ship the second echelon overnight, so that much of the second echelon and third echelon could land on S plus one, with the remainder on S plus two.  The Navy intended that all four invasion fleets would return across the Channel on the night of S plus two, having been moored for three full days off the South coast of England. The Army had sought to have the third echelon cross in later separate convoys to avoid men and horses having to wait for as long as four days and nights in their barges, but the Kriegsmarine were insistent that they could only protect the four fleets from Royal Navy attack if all vessels crossed the Channel together.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=248}}\n\nIn the summer of 1940, UK [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|Home Forces Command]] tended to consider [[East Anglia]] and the East coast to be the most likely landing sites for a German invasion force, as this would have offered much greater opportunities to seize ports and natural harbours, and would be further from naval forces at [[Portsmouth]]. But then the accumulation of invasion barges in French ports from late August 1940 rather indicated a landing on the South coast.  Consequently, the main Home Forces mobile reserve force was held back around London, so as to be able to move forwards to protect the capital, either into Kent or Essex.  Hence, Sea Lion landings in Kent and Sussex would have been initially opposed by [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] of [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] with three infantry divisions and two independent brigades and [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] of [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] with three infantry divisions. In reserve were two more Corps under [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|GHQ Home Forces]]; located south of London was the [[VII Corps (United Kingdom)|VII Corps]] with the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]], an armoured division and an independent armoured brigade, while north of London was [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] with an armoured division, infantry division and independent infantry brigade.{{sfn|Collier|1962|pp=219-220}}\n\n== Air power ==\n\n=== Airborne Forces ===\n\nThe success of the German [[Norwegian Campaign|invasion of Denmark and Norway]], on 9 April 1940, had relied extensively on the use of paratroop and glider-borne formations (''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'') to capture key defensive points in advance of the main invasion forces. The same airborne tactics had also been used in support of the invasions of [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940. However, although spectacular success had been achieved in the airborne assault on [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium, German airborne forces had come close to disaster in their attempt to seize the Dutch government and capital of [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]]. Around 1,300 of the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]] had been captured (subsequently shipped to Britain as [[prisoners of war]]), around 250 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport aircraft had been lost, and several hundred elite paratroops and air-landing infantry had been killed or injured. Consequently, even in September 1940 the Luftwaffe had the capacity to provide only around 3,000 airborne troops to participate in the first wave of Operation Sea Lion.\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\n{{Main|Battle of Britain}}\n[[File:Winston Churchill visiting bomb-damaged areas of the East End of London, 8 September 1940.

In addition, wider raids gave aircrew experience of day and night navigation, and tested the defences.<ref>{{Cite news\n| url         = http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/german-history-of-world-war-ii/world-war-two-battles/battle-britain/operation-sea-lion/\n| title       = Operation Sea Lion\n| date        = 13 February 2018\n| work        = Historical Society of German Military History \u2013 Historische Gesellschaft der deutschen Milit\u00e4rgeschichte\n| access-date = 7 March 2018\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151117/http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/german-history-of-world-war-ii/world-war-two-battles/battle-britain/operation-sea-lion/\n| archivedate = 7 March 2018\n}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} On 13 August, the German ''Luftwaffe'' began a series of concentrated aerial attacks (designated ''Unternehmen Adlerangriff'' or [[Operation Eagle Attack]]) on targets throughout the United Kingdom in an attempt to destroy the RAF and establish air superiority over [[Great Britain]].  The change in emphasis of the bombing from [[List of Royal Air Force stations|RAF bases]] to [[the Blitz|bombing London]], however, turned ''Adlerangriff'' into a short-range [[strategic bombing]] operation.\n\nThe effect of the switch in strategy is disputed. Some historians argue the change in strategy lost the Luftwaffe the opportunity of winning the air battle, or air superiority.<ref>Wood and Dempster 2003, pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> Others argue the ''Luftwaffe'' achieved little in the air battle and the RAF was not on the verge of collapse, as often claimed.<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 368\u2013369.</ref> Another perspective has also been put forward, which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed.<ref>Hooton 2010, p. 80.</ref> Others have said that it was unlikely the ''Luftwaffe'' would ever have been able to destroy [[RAF Fighter Command]]. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power, compared to the Royal Navy.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\n=== Limitations of the ''Luftwaffe'' ===\n{{See also|Aircraft of the Battle of Britain}}\nThe track record of the ''Luftwaffe'' against naval combat vessels up to that point in the war was poor. In the [[Norwegian Campaign]], despite eight weeks of continuous air supremacy, the ''Luftwaffe'' sank only two British warships. The German aircrews were not trained or equipped to attack fast-moving naval targets, particularly agile naval destroyers or [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTB). The Luftwaffe also lacked armour-piercing bombs<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=3l_vg1p5EHsC&pg=PA374\n| title      = World War II: Crucible of the Contemporary World : Commentary and Readings \u2013 Google Books\n| accessdate = 8 April 2013\n| isbn = 9780873327312\n| last1 = Lee\n| first1 = Loyd E.\n| last2 = Lee\n| first2 = Lily Xiao Hong\n| year = 1991\n}}</ref> and their only [[aerial torpedo]] capability, essential for defeating larger warships, consisted of a small number of slow and vulnerable [[Heinkel He 115]] floatplanes. The ''Luftwaffe'' made 21 deliberate attacks on small torpedo boats during the Battle of Britain, sinking none. The British had between 700 and 800 small coastal craft (MTBs, [[Motor Gun Boat]]s and smaller vessels), making them a critical threat if the ''Luftwaffe'' could not deal with the force. Only nine MTBs were lost to air attack out of 115 sunk by various means throughout the [[Second World War]]. Only nine destroyers were sunk by air attack in 1940, out of a force of over 100 operating in British waters at the time. Only five were sunk while [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuating Dunkirk]], despite large periods of German air superiority, thousands of sorties flown, and hundreds of tons of bombs dropped. The ''Luftwaffe'''s record against merchant shipping was also  unimpressive: it sank only one in every 100 British vessels passing through British waters in 1940, and most of this total was achieved using mines.<ref>Larew 1992, pp. 245\u2013247.</ref>\n\n==== ''Luftwaffe'' Special Equipment ====\nHad an invasion taken place, the [[Bf 110]] equipped ''[[Erprobungsgruppe 210]]'' would have dropped ''[[Seilbomb]]en'' just prior to the landings. This was a secret weapon which would have been used to blackout the electricity network in South-east England. The equipment for dropping the wires was fitted to the [[Bf 110]] aeroplanes and tested. It involved dropping wires across high voltage wires, and was probably as dangerous to the aircraft crews as to the British.<ref>Messerschmitt Bf 110 Bombsights Over England: Erprobungsgruppe 210 in the Battle of Britain by John Vasco</ref> However, there was no national electricity network in the UK at this time, only the local generation of electricity for each city/town and surrounding area.\n\n=== Italian air force ===\nUpon hearing of Hitler's intentions, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], through his Foreign Minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]], quickly offered up to ten divisions and thirty squadrons of Italian aircraft for the proposed invasion.<ref name=Cox158>Cox, p.158</ref> Hitler initially declined any such aid but eventually allowed a small contingent of Italian fighters and bombers, the Italian Air Corps (''[[Corpo Aereo Italiano]]'' or CAI), to assist in the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s aerial campaign over Britain in October and November 1940.<ref>Macksey, Kenneth, ''Beda Fomm:  The Classic Victory'', p. 35. Ballantine, New York, 1971.</ref>\n\n== Navy ==\n[[File:D.Adm.66 Der Kanal Ost Blatt by www.kartengruppe.it.jpg|thumb|left|The Channel (Der Kanal), D.66 Kriegsmarine nautical chart, 1943]]\nThe most daunting problem for Germany in protecting an invasion fleet was the small size of its navy. The ''Kriegsmarine'', already numerically far inferior to Britain's Royal Navy, had lost a sizeable portion of its large modern surface units in April 1940 during the [[Norwegian Campaign]], either as complete losses or due to battle damage. In particular, the loss of two light cruisers and ten destroyers was crippling, as these were the very warships most suited to operating in the Channel narrows where the invasion would likely take place.<ref name=\"Von der Porten111\">Von der Porten, p.111</ref> Most [[U-boat]]s, the most powerful arm of the {{lang|de|Kriegsmarine}}, were meant for destroying ships, not supporting an invasion.\n\nAlthough the Royal Navy could not bring the whole of its naval superiority to bear\u2014as most of the fleet was engaged in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and a substantial proportion had been detached to support [[Operation Menace]] against [[Dakar]]\u2014the British [[Home Fleet]] still had a very large advantage in numbers. It was debatable whether British ships were as vulnerable to enemy air attack as the Germans hoped. During the [[Operation Dynamo|Dunkirk evacuation]], few warships were actually sunk, despite being stationary targets. The overall disparity between the opposing naval forces made the amphibious invasion plan extremely risky, regardless of the outcome in the air. In addition, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had allocated its few remaining larger and more modern ships to diversionary operations in the [[North Sea]].\n\nThe fleet of defeated France, one of the most powerful and modern in the world, might have tipped the balance against Britain if it had been captured by the Germans. However, the pre-emptive destruction of a large part of the French fleet by the British [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], and the [[scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|scuttling of the remainder by the French themselves at Toulon two years later]], ensured that this could not happen.\n\nThe view of those who believed, regardless of a potential German victory in the air battle, that Sea Lion was still not going to succeed included a number of German General Staff members. After the war, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] said he believed air superiority was \"not enough\". D\u00f6nitz stated, \"[W]e possessed neither control of the air or the sea; nor were we in any position to gain it\".<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997 edition), p. 114.</ref> In his memoirs, [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in 1940, argued:\n{{quote|.....the emphatic reminder that up until now the British had never thrown the full power of their fleet into action. However, a German invasion of England would be a matter of life and death for the British, and they would unhesitatingly commit their naval forces, to the last ship and the last man, into an all-out fight for survival. Our Air Force could not be counted on to guard our transports from the British Fleets, because their operations would depend on the weather, if for no other reason. It could not be expected that even for a brief period our Air Force could make up for our lack of naval supremacy.<ref>Raeder 2001, pp. 324\u2013325.</ref>}}\n\nOn 13 August 1940, [[Alfred Jodl]], Chief of Operations in the [[OKW]] (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'') wrote his \"Assessment of the situation arising from the views of the Army and Navy on a landing in England.\" His first point was that \"The landing operation must under no circumstances fail. A failure could leave political consequences, which would go far beyond the military ones.\" He believed that the ''Luftwaffe'' could meet its essential objectives, but if the ''Kriegsmarine'' could not meet the operational requirements of the Army for an attack on a broad front with two divisions landed within four days, followed promptly by three further divisions irrespective of weather, \"then I consider the landing to be an act of desperation, which would have to be risked in a desperate situation, but which we have no reason whatsoever to undertake at this moment.\"{{sfn| Evans| Mcgeoch|2014|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n=== Minefields ===\n\nLacking surface naval forces capable of meeting the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy in open battle, the main seaborne defence for the first wave invasion fleets would be four massive minefields; which were intended to be laid from S minus nine onwards.  The ANTON minefield (off [[Selsey Bill]]) and  the BRUNO minefield (off [[Beachy Head]]), each totalling over 3,000 mines in four rows, would block off the invasion beaches against naval forces from Portsmouth; while the counterpart CAESAR minefield would block off beach 'B' from Dover.  A fourth minefield, DORA, was to be laid off [[Lyme Bay]] to inhibit naval forces from [[Plymouth]].  By the autumn of 1940, the Kriegsmarine had achieved considerable success in laying minefields in support of active operations, notably in the night of [[Texel Disaster|31 August 1940]] when the 20th Destroyer flotilla suffered heavy losses when running into a newly laid German minefield off Texel.\n\n=== Landing craft ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1369-10A, Wilhelmshaven, Prahme f\u00fcr \"Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we\".jpg|thumb|Invasion barges assembled at the German port of [[Wilhelmshaven]].]]\nIn 1940 the German Navy was ill-prepared for mounting an amphibious assault the size of Operation Sea Lion. Lacking purpose-built landing craft and both doctrinal and practical experience with amphibious warfare, the ''Kriegsmarine'' was largely starting from scratch. Some efforts had been made during the inter-war years to investigate landing military forces by sea, but inadequate funding severely limited any useful progress.<ref name=Schenk22-25>Schenk, pp.22\u201325</ref>\n\nFor the successful [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], German naval forces (assisted in places by thick fog) had simply forced an entry into key Norwegian harbours with motor launches and [[E-boats]] against stiff resistance from the outgunned Norwegian army and navy, and then unloaded troops from destroyers and troop transports directly onto the dockfronts at [[Bergen]], [[Egersund]], [[Trondheim]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Arendal]] and Horten.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=71}} At [[Stavanger]] and [[Oslo]] capture of the port was preceded by landing airborne forces.  No beach landings were attempted.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-2781-19, Russland, Landungsboot mit Zugkraftwagen.jpg|thumb|left|A {{Interlanguage link multi|Pionierlandungsboot|de}}.]]\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' had taken some small steps in remedying the landing craft situation with construction of the ''[[Pionierlandungsboot 39]]'' (Engineer Landing Boat 39), a self-propelled shallow-draft vessel which could carry 45 infantrymen, two light vehicles or 20 tons of cargo and land on an open beach, unloading via a pair of clamshell doors at the bow. But by late September 1940 only two prototypes had been delivered.<ref name=Schenk29>Schenk, p.29</ref>\n\nRecognising the need for an even larger craft capable of landing both tanks and infantry onto a hostile shore, the ''Kriegsmarine'' began development of the 220-ton ''[[Marinef\u00e4hrprahm]]'' (MFP) but these too were unavailable in time for a landing on British soil in 1940, the first of them not being commissioned until April 1941.\n\nGiven barely two months to assemble a large seagoing invasion fleet, the ''Kriegsmarine'' opted to convert inland river barges into makeshift landing craft. Approximately 2,400 barges were collected from throughout Europe (860 from Germany, 1,200 from the Netherlands and Belgium and 350 from France). Of these, only about 800 were powered albeit insufficiently to cross the Channel under their own power. All barges would be towed across by tugs, with two barges to a tug in line abreast, preferably one being powered and one unpowered.  On reaching the English coast, the powered barges would be cast-off, to beach themselves under their own power; the unpowered barges would be taken inshore as far as possible by the tugs and anchored, so as to settle on the falling tide, their troops unloading some hours later than those on the powered barges.<ref name=Schenk67>Schenk, p.67</ref>  Accordingly, the Sea Lion plans were prepared on the basis that the landings would take place shortly after high tide and on a date when this coincided with sunrise. Towards evening, on the following rising tide, the empty barges would have been retrieved by their tugs to receive the second echelon forces, stores and heavy equipment in the awaiting transport vessels. These transport vessels would have remained moored off the beach throughout the day.  By contrast, the Allied [[D day]] landings in 1944 were timed to happen at low tide; with all troops and equipment transhipped from their transport vessels to landing craft off-shore overnight.\n\nAll the troops intended to land at beach 'E', the westernmost of the four beaches, would cross the channel in larger transport vessels - the barges being towed loaded with equipment but empty of troops - and would then be transferred onto their barges a short distance from the beach.  For the landings on the other three beaches, the first echelon of the invasion forces (and their equipment) would be loaded onto their barges in French or Belgian ports, while the second echelon force crossed the channel in associated transport vessels. Once the first echelon had been unloaded onto the beach, the barges would return to the transport vessels to transport the second echelon. The same procedure was envisaged for the second wave (unless the first wave had captured a usable port). Trials showed that this process of trans-shipment in open sea, in any circumstances other than flat calm, would likely take at least 14 hours,{{sfn|McKinstry|2014|p=307}} such that the disembarkation of the first wave might extend over several tides and several days, with barges and invasion fleet subsequently needing to be escorted together back across the Channel for repairs and reloading. Since loading of the tanks, vehicles and stores of the second wave onto the returned barges and transport ships would take at least a week, the second wave could not be expected to land much less than ten days after the first wave, and more likely longer still.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=249}}\n\n==== Barge types ====\nTwo types of inland river barge were generally available in Europe for use in Sea Lion: the ''peniche'', which was 38.5 meters long and carried 360 tons of cargo, and the ''Kampine'', which was 50 meters long and carried 620 tons of cargo. Of the barges collected for the invasion, 1,336 were classified as ''peniches'' and 982 as ''Kampinen''. For simplicity's sake, the Germans designated any barge up to the size of a standard ''peniche'' as Type A1 and anything larger as Type A2.<ref name=Schenk65-74>Schenk, pp.65\u201374</ref>\n\n==== Type A ====\nConverting the assembled barges into landing craft involved cutting an opening in the bow for off-loading troops and vehicles, welding longitudinal I-beams and transverse braces to the hull to improve seaworthiness, adding a wooden internal ramp and pouring a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport. As modified, the Type A1 barge could accommodate three medium tanks while the Type A2 could carry four.<ref name=Schenk99>Schenk, p.99</ref>  Tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery were envisaged as crossing the Channel in one of around 170 transport ships, which would be anchored off the landing beaches while the barges disembarked the first echelon of assault troops; those in powered barges disembarking soonest.  The empty barges would then have been retrieved by tugs on the following rising tide, so as to have the second echelon (including tanks and other heavy equipment) loaded onto them using ship's [[derrick]]s. Barges would consequently have shuttled between ships and beaches over at least two days before being assembled together for the escorted night-time return voyage across the Channel.\n\n==== Type B ====\nThis barge was a Type A altered to carry and rapidly off-load the submersible tanks (''Tauchpanzer'') developed for use in Sea Lion. They had the advantage of being able to unload their tanks directly into water up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} in depth, several hundred yards from shore, whereas the unmodified Type A had to be firmly grounded on the beach, making it more vulnerable to enemy fire. The Type B required a longer external ramp (11 meters) with a float attached to the front of it. Once the barge anchored, the crew would extend the internally stowed ramp using block and tackle sets until it was resting on the water's surface. As the first tank rolled forward onto the ramp, its weight would tilt the forward end of the ramp into the water and push it down onto the seabed. Once the tank rolled off, the ramp would bob back up to a horizontal position, ready for the next one to exit. If a barge was securely grounded along its full length, the longer ramp could also be used to discharge submersible tanks directly onto the beach, and beachmasters were given the option of landing tanks by this method, if the risk of loss in submersible running appeared to be too high.  The Navy High Command increased its initial order for 60 of these vessels to 70 in order to compensate for expected losses. A further five were ordered on 30 September as a reserve.<ref name=Schenk99-105>Schenk, pp.99\u2013105</ref>\n\n==== Type C ====\nThe Type C barge was specifically converted to carry the [[Panzer II]] amphibious tank (''Schwimmpanzer''). Because of the extra width of the floats attached to this tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into the bow of the barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four ''Schwimmpanzern'' in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.<ref name=Schenk105-107>Schenk, pp.105\u2013107</ref>\n\n==== Type AS ====\nDuring the planning stages of Sea Lion, it was deemed desirable to provide the advanced infantry detachments (making the initial landings) with greater protection from small-arms and light artillery fire by lining the sides of a powered Type A barge with concrete. Wooden slides were also installed along the barge's hull to accommodate ten assault boats (''Sturmboote''), each capable of carrying six infantrymen and powered by a 30&nbsp;hp outboard motor. The extra weight of this additional armour and equipment reduced the barge's load capacity to 40 tons. By mid-August, 18 of these craft, designated Type AS, had been converted, and another five were ordered on 30 September.<ref name=\"Schenk99\" />\n\n==== Type AF ====\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' had formed its own special command (''Sonderkommando'') under Major Fritz Siebel to investigate the production of landing craft for Sea Lion. Major Siebel proposed giving the unpowered Type A barges their own motive power by installing a pair of surplus {{convert|600|hp|PS kW|abbr=on}} BMW aircraft engines, driving propellers. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was highly sceptical of this venture, but the ''Heer'' (Army) high command enthusiastically embraced the concept and Siebel proceeded with the conversions.<ref name=Schenk94-98>Schenk, pp.94\u201398</ref>\n\nThe aircraft engines were mounted on a platform supported by iron scaffolding at the aft end of the vessel. Cooling water was stored in tanks mounted above-deck. As completed, the Type AF had a speed of six knots, and a range of 60 nautical miles unless auxiliary fuel tanks were fitted. Disadvantages of this set-up included an inability to back the vessel astern, limited manoeuvrability and the deafening noise of the engines which would have made voice commands problematic.<ref name=\"Schenk94-98\" />\n\nBy 1 October 128 Type A barges had been converted to airscrew propulsion and, by the end of the month, this figure had risen to over 200.<ref name=Schenk95>Schenk, p.95</ref>\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' later used some of the motorised Sea Lion barges for landings on the Russian-held Baltic islands in 1941 and, though most of them were eventually returned to the inland rivers they originally plied, a reserve was kept for military transport duties and for filling out amphibious flotillas.<ref name=Schenk94>Schenk, p.94</ref>\n\n== Army ==\n\n=== Panzers ashore ===\nProviding armour support for the initial wave of assault troops was a critical concern for Sea Lion planners, and much effort was devoted to finding practical ways of rapidly getting tanks onto the invasion beaches in support of the first echelon. Though the Type A barges could disembark several medium tanks onto an open beach, this could be accomplished only once the tide had fallen further and the barges were firmly grounded along their full length; otherwise a leading tank might topple off an unsteady ramp and block those behind from deployment. The time needed for assembling the external ramps also meant that both the tanks and the ramp assembly crews would be exposed to close-quarter enemy fire for a considerable time. A safer and faster method was needed and the Germans eventually settled on providing some tanks with floats and making others fully submersible.  It was nevertheless recognised that a high proportion of these specialised tanks might be expected not to make it off the beach.\n\n==== ''Schwimmpanzer'' ====\nThe ''Schwimmpanzer'' II [[Panzer II]], at 8.9 tons, was light enough to float with the attachment of long rectangular buoyancy boxes on each side of the tank's hull. The boxes were machined from aluminium stock and filled with Kapok sacks for added buoyancy. Motive power came from the tank's own tracks which were connected by rods to a propeller shaft running through each float. The ''Schwimmpanzer'' II could make 5.7&nbsp;km/h in the water. An inflatable rubber hose around the turret ring created a waterproof seal between the hull and turret. The tank's 2&nbsp;cm gun and coaxial machinegun were kept operational and could be fired while the tank was still making its way ashore. Because of the great width of the pontoons, ''Schwimmpanzer'' IIs were to be deployed from specially-modified Type C landing barges, from which they could be launched directly into open water from a large hatch cut into the stern. The Germans converted 52 of these tanks to amphibious use prior to Sea Lion's cancellation.<ref name=Schenk113>Schenk, p.113</ref>\n\n==== ''Tauchpanzer'' ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-5674-45, \u00dcbungen mit Panzer III f\u00fcr Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Panzer III]] ''Tauchpanzer'' under test (1940)]]\nThe ''Tauchpanzer'' or [[Deep fording|deep-wading]] tank (also referred to as the ''U-Panzer'' or ''Unterwasser Panzer'') was a standard [[Panzer III]] or [[Panzer IV]] medium tank with its hull made completely waterproof by sealing all sighting ports, hatches and air intakes with tape or caulk. The gap between the turret and hull was sealed with an inflatable hose while the main gun mantlet, commander's cupola and radio operator's machine gun were given special rubber coverings. Once the tank reached the shore, all covers and seals could be blown off via explosive cables, enabling normal combat operation.<ref name=Schenk111>Schenk, p.111</ref>\n\nFresh air for both the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18&nbsp;m long rubber hose to which a float was attached to keep one end above the water's surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal [[bilge]] pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional [[gyrocompass]] or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.<ref name=\"Schenk111\" />\n\nExperiments conducted at the end of June and early July at Schilling, near [[Wilhelmshaven]], showed that the submersible tanks functioned best when they were kept moving along the seabed as, if halted for any reason, they tended to sink into the seabed and remain stuck there. Obstacles such as underwater trenches or large rocks tended to stop the tanks in their tracks, and it was decided for this reason that they should be landed at high tide so that any mired tanks could be retrieved at low tide. Submersible tanks could operate in water up to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=Schenk110-111>Schenk, pp.110\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' initially expected to use 50 specially-converted motor coasters to transport the submersible tanks, but testing with the coaster ''Germania'' showed this to be impractical. This was due to the ballast needed to offset the weight of the tanks, and the requirement that the coasters be grounded to prevent them from capsizing as the tanks were transferred by crane onto the vessel's wooden side ramps. These difficulties led to development of the Type B barge.<ref name=\"Schenk110-111\" />\n\nBy the end of August the Germans had converted 160 Panzer IIIs, 42 Panzer IVs, and 52 Panzer IIs to amphibious use. This gave them a paper strength of 254 machines, about an equivalent number to those that would otherwise have been allocated to an armoured division. The tanks were divided into four battalions or detachments labelled ''Panzer-Abteilung'' A, B, C and D. They were to carry sufficient fuel and ammunition for a combat radius of 200&nbsp;km.<ref name=Evans121>Evans, p.121</ref>\n\n=== Specialised landing equipment ===\nAs part of a ''Kriegsmarine'' competition, prototypes for a prefabricated \"heavy landing bridge\" or [[jetty]] (similar in function to later Allied [[Mulberry Harbour]]s) were designed and built by [[Krupp]] Stahlbau and Dortmunder Union and successfully overwintered in the North Sea in 1941\u201342.<ref name=Bonnard>Alderney at War. Brian Bonnard. 1993.{{ISBN|0-7509-0343-0}}. pp106-108. Alan Sutton Publishing.</ref> Krupp's design won out, as it only required one day to install, as opposed to twenty-eight days for the Dortmunder Union bridge. The Krupp bridge consisted of a series of 32m-long connecting platforms, each supported on the seabed by four steel columns. The platforms could be raised or lowered by heavy-duty winches in order to accommodate the tide. The German Navy initially ordered eight complete Krupp units composed of six platforms each. This was reduced to six units by the autumn of 1941, and eventually cancelled altogether when it became apparent that Sea Lion would never take place.<ref name=Schenk139>Schenk, p.139</ref>\n\nIn mid-1942, both the Krupp and Dortmunder prototypes were shipped to the [[Channel Islands]] and installed together off [[Alderney]], where they were used for unloading materials needed to fortify the island. Referred to as the \"German jetty\" by local inhabitants, they remained standing for the next thirty-six years until demolition crews finally removed them in 1978\u201379, a testament to their durability.<ref name=Schenk139 />\n\nThe [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] developed a portable landing bridge of its own nicknamed ''Seeschlange'' (Sea Snake). This \"floating roadway\"  was formed from a series of joined modules that could be towed into place to act as a temporary jetty. Moored ships could then either unload their cargo directly onto the roadbed or lower it down onto waiting vehicles via their heavy-duty booms. The ''Seeschlange'' was successfully tested by the Army Training Unit at [[Le Havre]] in France in the autumn of 1941 and later chosen for use in ''[[Operation Herkules]]'', the proposed Italo-German invasion of [[Malta]]. It was easily transportable by rail.<ref name=Schenk139 />\n\nA specialised vehicle intended for Sea Lion was the ''[[Landwasserschlepper]]'' (LWS), an amphibious tractor under development since 1935. It was originally intended for use by Army engineers to assist with river crossings. Three of them were assigned to Tank Detachment 100 as part of the invasion; it was intended to use them for pulling ashore unpowered assault barges and towing vehicles across the beaches. They would also have been used to carry supplies directly ashore during the six hours of falling tide when the barges were grounded. This involved towing a ''[[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]]'' amphibious trailer capable of transporting 10\u201320 tons of freight behind the LWS.<ref name=Schenk132-133>Schenk, pp.132\u2013133</ref> The LWS was demonstrated to General Halder on 2 August 1940 by the Reinhardt Trials Staff on the island of [[Sylt]] and, though he was critical of its high silhouette on land, he recognised the overall usefulness of the design. It was proposed to build enough tractors that one or two could be assigned to each invasion barge, but the late date and difficulties in mass-producing the vehicle prevented this.<ref name=\"Schenk132-133\" />\n\n=== Other equipment to be used for the first time ===\n\nOperation Sea Lion would have been the first ever amphibious invasion by a mechanised army, and the largest amphibious invasion since [[Gallipoli]]. The Germans had to invent and improvise a lot of equipment. They also proposed to use some new weapons and use upgrades of their existing equipment for the first time. These included:\n\n# New [[antitank gun]]s and [[Armor-piercing ammunition|ammunition]]. The standard German antitank gun, the 37&nbsp;mm [[Pak 36]], was capable of penetrating the armour of all 1940 British tanks except the [[Matilda II tank|Matilda]] and [[Valentine tank|Valentine]]. Armour-piercing ballistic capped (tungsten-cored) ammunition (Pzgr. 40) for 37&nbsp;mm Pak 36 had become available in time for the invasion.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.littlewars.se/sealion/germanweapons.html\n| title       = German Weapons \u2013 Operation Sealion (Seel\u00f6we) \u2013 The German Invasion of Britain 1940\n| website     = littlewars.se\n| accessdate  = 28 April 2018\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180428145550/http://www.littlewars.se/sealion/germanweapons.html\n| archivedate = 28 April 2018\n}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} The 37&nbsp;mm Pzgr.40 would still have had trouble penetrating the Matilda II's armour<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/ww2pen3.pdf\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 10 May 2013\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170216085132/http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/ww2pen3.pdf\n| archivedate = 16 February 2017\n}}</ref> so the first echelon units replaced theirs with French or Czechoslovak 47&nbsp;mm guns (which weren't much better).<ref>Schenk p.183</ref> The [[Pak 36]] began to be replaced by the 50&nbsp;mm [[Pak 38]] in mid-1940. The [[Pak 38]], which could penetrate a Matilda's armour, would probably have seen action first with Sea Lion as it would have been issued initially to the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' and the ''Heer'''s elite units, and all those units were in the Sea Lion force.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} These included the ''[[SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]]'' regiment, the ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'' regiment, 2 mountain, 2 ''J\u00e4ger'', 2 ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'', 4 panzer, and 2 motorised divisions. In addition, the 7th Infantry division was considered one of the best in the ''Heer'', and the 35th almost as good.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n# Captured French armoured tractors.<ref>p. 183 Schenk</ref> The use of these tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence upon horses and probably would have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches. In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The [[Renault UE Chenillette]] (German name: ''Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)'') was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans.<ref>[[Anthony Tucker-Jones]], ''Hitler's Great Panzer Heist'', Pen & Sword Books, 2007, p.59 & p. 155</ref> They had a storage compartment that could carry 350&nbsp;kg, pull a trailer weighing 775&nbsp;kg for a total of about 1000&nbsp;kg, and could climb a 50% slope. The armour was 5\u20139&nbsp;mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the [[Lorraine 37L]], which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690&nbsp;kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised,<ref>Schenk p. 183</ref> with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.<ref>Peter Fleming says on page 229 that the number of horses was reduced to 4,200 for the first wave (466 per division) and 7,000 for the second wave.</ref>\n# 48\u00d7 [[Stug III]] Ausf B Assault Guns- 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 37 L/24, 50&nbsp;mm armour and improved suspension.

This was far in excess of what the ''Kriegsmarine'' could supply, and final plans were more modest, calling for nine [[division (military)|divisions]] to make an [[amphibious assault]] on [[Sussex]] and Kent with around 67,000 men in the first [[echelon formation|echelon]] and a single [[airborne forces|airborne]] division of 3,000 men to support them.<ref name=Schenk231>Schenk, p.231</ref> The chosen invasion sites ran from [[Rottingdean]] in the west to [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] in the east.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' wanted a front as short as possible, as it regarded this as more defensible. Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from [[Dover]] to [[Eastbourne]] and stressed that shipping between [[Cherbourg]]/Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Royal Navy based in [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]]. General Halder rejected this: \"From the army's point of view I regard it as complete suicide, I might just as well put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine\".<ref>Shears, David. ''Operation Sealion'',<!--publisher & place?--> p.162.</ref>\n\nOne complication was the tidal flow in the [[English Channel]], where high water moves from west to east, with high water at [[Lyme Regis]] occurring around six hours before it reaches Dover. If all the landings were to be made at high water across a broad front, they would have to be made at different times along different parts of the coast, with the landings in Dover being made six hours after any landings in Dorset and thus losing the element of surprise. If the landings were to be made at the same time, methods would have to be devised to disembark men, vehicles and supplies at all states of the tide. That was another reason to favour landing craft.\n\n== German coastal guns ==\n{{Main|Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War}}\nWith Germany's occupation of the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region in [[Northern France]], the possibility of closing the [[Strait of Dover]] to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys by the use of land-based heavy artillery became readily apparent, both to the German High Command and to Hitler. Even the ''Kriegsmarine'''s Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal, especially given the relatively short distance, {{convert|34|km|abbr=on}}, between the French and English coasts. Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast, primarily at Pas-de-Calais. This work was assigned to the ''[[Organisation Todt]]'' and commenced on 22 July 1940.<ref name=Schenk323>Schenk, p.323</ref>\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|right|The huge [[21 cm K 12 (E)|21 cm K12 railway gun]] was only suitable for bombarding targets on land.]]\nBy early August, four {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} traversing turrets were fully operational as were all of the Army's railway guns. Seven of these weapons, six 28&nbsp;cm [[Krupp K5|K5 pieces]] and a single {{convert|21|cm|abbr=on}} [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 gun]] with a range of {{convert|115|km|abbr=on}}, could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28&nbsp;cm and five {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} pieces, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24&nbsp;cm guns and ten 21&nbsp;cm weapons, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long loading time and ammunition types.<ref name=Schenk324>Schenk, p.324</ref>\n\nBetter suited for use against naval targets were the four heavy naval batteries installed by mid-September: ''Friedrich August'' with three [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|{{convert|30.5|cm|abbr=on}} barrels]]; ''Prinz Heinrich'' with two [[28 cm SK L/40 gun|28&nbsp;cm guns]]; ''[[Battery Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]'' with two 24&nbsp;cm weapons and, largest of all, ''Siegfried'' (later renamed ''Batterie Todt'') with a pair of [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns]]. Fire control for these weapons was provided by both spotter aircraft and by DeTeGer\u00e4t radar sets installed at [[Blanc Nez]] and Cap d\u2019Alprech. These units were capable of detecting targets out to a range of {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}, including small British patrol craft inshore of the English coast. Two additional radar sites were added by mid-September: a DeTeGer\u00e4t at Cap de la Hague and a FernDeTeGer\u00e4t long-range radar at Cap d\u2019Antifer near Le Havre.<ref name=Schenk324-325>Schenk, pp.324\u2013325</ref>\n\nTo strengthen German control of the Channel narrows, the Army planned to quickly establish mobile artillery batteries along the English shoreline once a beachhead had been firmly established. Towards that end, 16th Army's ''Artillerie Kommand 106'' was slated to land with the second wave to provide fire protection for the transport fleet as early as possible. This unit consisted of twenty-four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and seventy-two {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} guns. About one third of them were to be deployed on English soil by the end of Sea Lion's first week.<ref name=Schenk325-327>Schenk, pp.325\u2013327</ref>\n\nThe presence of these batteries was expected to greatly reduce the threat posed by British destroyers and smaller craft along the eastern approaches as the guns would be sited to cover the main transport routes from Dover to Calais and [[Hastings]] to Boulogne. They could not entirely protect the western approaches, but a large area of those invasion zones would still be within effective range.<ref name=Schenk325-327 />\n\nThe British military was well aware of the dangers posed by German artillery dominating the Dover Strait and on 4 September 1940 the Chief of Naval Staff issued a memo stating that if the Germans \"\u2026could get possession of the Dover defile and capture its gun defences from us, then, holding these points on both sides of the Straits, they would be in a position largely to deny those waters to our naval forces\". Should the Dover defile be lost, he concluded, the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel, at least by day, and he further warned that \"\u2026there might really be a chance that they (the Germans) might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country\". The very next day the Chiefs of Staff, after discussing the importance of the defile, decided to reinforce the Dover coast with more ground troops.<ref name=Cox149-150>Cox, pp.149\u2013150</ref>\n\nThe guns started to fire in the second week of August 1940 and were not silenced until 1944, when the batteries were overrun by Allied ground forces. They caused 3,059 alerts, 216 civilian deaths, and damage to 10,056 premises in the Dover area. However, despite firing on frequent slow moving coastal convoys, often in broad daylight, for almost the whole of that period (there was an interlude in 1943), there is no record of any vessel being hit by them, although one seaman was killed and others were injured by shell splinters from near misses.<ref>Hewitt, Nick p. 109</ref> Whatever the perceived risk, this lack of ability to hit any moving ship does not support the contention that the German coastal batteries would have been a serious threat to fast destroyers or smaller warships.<ref>Hewitt, Geoff p. 41</ref>\n\n== Indefinite postponement ==\nDuring the summer of 1940, both the British public and the Americans believed that a German invasion was imminent, and they studied the forthcoming [[high tide]]s of 5\u20139 August, 2\u20137 September, 1\u20136 October, and 30 October \u2013 4 November as likely dates.<ref name=\"sptimes19400803\">{{cite news\n| url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XE0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5186%2C219407\n| title      = Next Week May See Nazis Attempt British Invasion\n| work       = St. Petersburg Times\n| date       = 3 August 1940\n| accessdate = 26 November 2011\n| page       = 1\n}}</ref> The British [[British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War|prepared extensive defences]], and, in Churchill's view, \"the great invasion scare\" was \"serving a most useful purpose\" by \"keeping every man and woman tuned to a high pitch of readiness\".{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=70\u201371}}<ref>John Colville, ''The Fringes of Power'' (1986), diary notes on Churchill's 11 July meetings; in {{cite book\n| author    = Michael I.

On 10 July, he advised the War Cabinet that the possibility of invasion could be ignored, as it \"would be a most hazardous and suicidal operation\"; and on 13 August that \"now that we were so much stronger\", he thought \"we could spare an armoured brigade from this country\". Over-riding [[John Dill|General Dill]], Churchill initiated [[Operation Compass|Operation Apology]] by which a series of troop convoys, including three tank regiments and eventually the entire 2nd Armoured Division, were sent around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to reinforce [[Archibald Wavell|General Wavell]] in the Middle East in support of operations against [[Italy|Italian]] colonial forces (Italy had declared war on 10 June).{{sfn|Deighton|1996|p=51}} Furthermore, on Churchill's urging, on 5 August the War Cabinet approved [[Operation Menace]], in which a substantial proportion of the Home Fleet - two battleships, an aircraft carrier, five cruisers, and twelve destroyers, together with five out of six battalions of [[Royal Marines]], were dispatched to [[Dakar]] on 30 August in an attempt to neutralise the battleship [[French battleship Richelieu|Richelieu]] and detach [[French West Africa]] from [[Vichy France]] to the control of the [[Free French]].  Overall, these actions in the summer of 1940 demonstrated Churchill's confidence in August 1940; that the immediate danger of a German invasion was now over, that the Home Forces were fully adequate to defend Great Britain if the Germans did come, and that the interests of the British Empire were, for the present, better served by attacking the colonial forces of Germany's allies, rather than by confronting the German Army directly.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|pp=196-199}}\n\nThe Germans were confident enough to film a simulation of the intended invasion in advance. A crew turned up at the Belgian port of [[Antwerp]] in early September 1940 and, for two days, they filmed tanks and troops landing from barges on a nearby beach under simulated fire. It was explained that, as the invasion would happen at night, Hitler wanted the German people to see all the details.<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 210, Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}</ref>\n\nIn early August, the German command had agreed that the invasion should begin on 15 September, but the Navy's revisions to its schedule set the date back to 20 September. At a conference on 14 September, Hitler praised the various preparations, but told his service chiefs that, as air superiority had still not been achieved, he would review whether to proceed with the invasion. At this conference, he gave the Luftwaffe the opportunity to act independently of the other services, with intensified continuous air attacks to overcome British resistance; on 16 September, G\u00f6ring issued orders for this new phase of the air attack.{{sfn|Overy|2010|pp=87\u201388}} On 17 September 1940, Hitler held a meeting with ''Reichsmarschall'' Hermann G\u00f6ring and ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] during which he became convinced the operation was not viable. Control of the skies was still lacking, and co-ordination among three branches of the armed forces was out of the question. Later that day, Hitler ordered the postponement of the operation. He ordered the dispersal of the invasion fleet in order to avert further damage by British air and naval attacks.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Wright\n| first     = Gordon\n| title     = The Ordeal of Total War: 1939\u20131945\n| url      = https://archive.org/details/ordealoftotalwar00wrig\n| url-access = registration\n| location  = New York\n| publisher = Harper & Row\n| year      = 1968\n| page      = [https://archive.org/details/ordealoftotalwar00wrig/page/32 32]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe postponement coincided with rumours that there had been an attempt to land on British shores on or about 7 September, which had been repulsed with large German casualties. The story was later expanded to include false reports that the British had set the sea on fire using flaming oil. Both versions were widely reported in the American press and in [[William L. Shirer]]'s ''[[Berlin Diary]]'', but both were officially denied by Britain and Germany. Author James Hayward has suggested that the whispering campaign around the \"failed invasion\" was a successful example of British [[black propaganda]] to bolster morale at home and in [[occupied Europe]], and convince America that Britain was not a lost cause.<ref>Hayward, James. ''Myths and Legends of the Second World War'', p. 214</ref>\n\nOn 12 October 1940, Hitler issued a directive releasing forces for other fronts. The appearance of preparations for Sea Lion was to be continued to keep political pressure on Britain, and a fresh directive would be issued if it was decided that invasion was to be reconsidered in the spring of 1941.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=927}}{{sfn|Overy|2010|p=88}}\n\nWhile the bombing of Britain intensified during [[the Blitz]], Hitler issued his Directive No. 21 on 18 December 1940 instructing the Wehrmacht to be ready for a quick attack to commence his long planned [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=339}} {{lang|de|Seel\u00f6we}} lapsed, never to be resumed.<ref>Fleming, Peter.,''Invasion 1940'' (Readers Union, London, 1958), p. 273.</ref>\n\n== Chances of success ==\n''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', believed the invasion could not succeed and doubted whether the German air force would be able to win unchallenged control of the skies; nevertheless he hoped that an early victory in the Battle of Britain would force the UK government to negotiate, without any need for an invasion.<ref>[[Bungay, Stephen]] (2000).

The great majority of military historians, including [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]], [[Derek Robinson (novelist)|Derek Robinson]] and [[Stephen Bungay]], have expressed the opinion that it had little chance of success and would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans. [[Len Deighton]] and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a \"[[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] in reverse\".<ref>[[Len Deighton|Deighton, Len]] (1980) ''Battle of Britain'' London: Jonathan Cape, {{page needed|date=December 2017}}</ref> Robinson argues the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the ''Kriegsmarine'' would have made Sea Lion a disaster. [[Andrew Gordon (naval historian)|Dr Andrew Gordon]], in an article for the ''[[Royal United Services Institute Journal]]''<ref>[https://rusi.org/commentary/battle-britain-naval-perspective ''RUSI Journal''], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228054046/https://rusi.org/commentary/battle-britain-naval-perspective |date=28 December 2017 }} (retrieved 27 December 2017)</ref> agrees with this and is clear in his conclusion the German Navy was never in a position to mount Sealion, regardless of any realistic outcome of the Battle of Britain. In his fictional [[alternate history]] ''Invasion: the German invasion of England, July 1940'', [[Kenneth Macksey]] proposes that the Germans might have succeeded if they had swiftly and decisively begun preparations even before the Dunkirk evacuations, and the Royal Navy for some reason had held back from large-scale intervention,<ref>Macksey 1990, pp. 144\u2013146.</ref> though in practice the Germans were unprepared for such a speedy commencement of their assault.<ref>Macksey 1990, pp. 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nAn alternative perspective was advanced in 2016 by [[Robert Forczyk]] in ''We march against England''. Forczyk claims to apply a much more realistic assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of both German and British forces, and challenges the views advanced by previous writers that the Royal Navy might easily have overwhelmed the German naval units protecting the first wave invasion fleet. His assessment concurs with that emerging from the 1974 [[Sandhurst Sea Lion wargame]] (see below) that the first wave would likely have crossed the Channel and established a lodgement around the landing beaches in Kent and East Sussex without major loss, and that the defending British forces would have been unlikely to have dislodged them once ashore. He proposes though, that the westernmost German landing at beach 'E' could not have been sustained for long against counterattacking British ground, naval and air forces, and that accordingly these German units would have had to fight their way eastwards, abandoning any aspiration to hold [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]. In the absence of access to a major port and with continued losses of German troop transport vessels from submarine attack, Forczyk argues that proposed arrangements for landing the second wave onto the beaches would have been wholly impractical once autumn and winter weather set into the Channel, so the first wave would be stranded in Kent as a 'beached whale' without substantial armour, transport or heavy artillery \u2014 unable to break out and threaten [[London]]. Nevertheless, Forczyk does not accept that they would have surrendered, pointing to the determined resistance of surrounded German forces at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and [[Demyansk Pocket|Demyansk]]. He suggests they could have held on into 1941, sustained by a small-ship fast night-time resupply operation into [[Folkestone Harbour|Folkestone]] (and maybe [[Port of Dover|Dover]]), holding the possibility of negotiating their withdrawal in Spring 1941 under a truce agreed with the British government.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|pp=242-270}}\n\n=== Logistics ===\nFour years later, the Allied [[D-Day]] landings showed just how much materiel had to be landed continuously to maintain an amphibious invasion. The problem for the Germans was worse, as the German Army was mostly horse-drawn. One of its prime headaches would have been transporting thousands of horses across the Channel.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Deighton\n| first     = Len\n| title     = [[Blood, Tears & Folly]]\n| publisher = Jonathan Cape, London\n| year      = 1993\n| isbn      = 0-224-03135-X\n}}</ref> British intelligence calculated that the first wave of 10 divisions (including the airborne division) would require a daily average of 3,300 tons of supplies.<ref>Fleming, p.237</ref> In fact, in Russia in 1941, when engaged in heavy fighting (at the end of a very long supply line), a single German infantry division required up to 1,100 tons of supplies a day,<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=b3W1tiuHzcoC&pg=PA298\n| title      = Handbook on German military forces \u2013 Google Books\n| date       = \n| accessdate = 8 April 2013\n| isbn = 9780807140710\n}}</ref> though a more usual figure would be 212-425 tons per day.<ref>Handbook on German military forces \u2013 Google Books p.VI-17 \u2013 VI-18</ref> The smaller figure is more likely due to the very short distances the supplies would have to travel. Rations for two weeks were to be provided to the German troops of the first wave because the armies had been instructed to live off the land as far as possible in order to minimise supply across the Channel during the initial phase of the battle.<ref name=Kieser226>Kieser, pp. 226</ref> British intelligence further calculated that Folkestone, the largest harbour falling within the planned German landing zones, could handle 150 tons per day in the first week of the invasion (assuming all dockside equipment was successfully demolished and regular RAF bombing raids reduced capacity by 50%). Within seven days, maximum capacity was expected to rise to 600 tons per day, once German shore parties had made repairs to the quays and cleared the harbour of any blockships and other obstacles. This meant that, at best, the nine German infantry and one airborne division landed in the first wave would receive less than 20% of the 3,300 tons of supplies they required each day through a port, and would have to rely heavily on whatever could be brought in directly over the beaches or air-lifted into captured airstrips.<ref name=Fleming257-58>Fleming, pp. 257\u2013258</ref>\n\nThe successful capture of [[Dover]] and its [[Port of Dover|harbour facilities]] might have been expected to add another 800 tons per day, raising to 40% the amount of supplies brought in through ports. However, this rested on the rather unrealistic assumption of little or no interference from the Royal Navy and RAF with the German supply convoys which would have been made up of underpowered (or unpowered, i.e. towed) inland waterways vessels as they shuttled slowly between the Continent to the invasion beaches and any captured harbours.<ref name=\"Fleming257-58\" />\n\n=== Weather ===\nFrom 19 to 26 September 1940, sea and wind conditions on and over the [[English Channel|Channel]] where the invasion was to take place were good overall, and a crossing, even using converted river barges, was feasible provided the [[sea state]] remained at less than 4, which for the most part it did. Winds for the remainder of the month were rated as \"moderate\" and would not have prevented the German invasion fleet from successfully depositing the first wave troops ashore during the ten days needed to accomplish this.<ref name=Fleming259>Fleming, p. 259</ref> From the night of 27 September, strong northerly winds prevailed, making passage more hazardous, but calm conditions returned on 11\u201312 October and again on 16\u201320 October. After that, light easterly winds prevailed which would have assisted any invasion craft travelling from the Continent towards the invasion beaches. But by the end of October, according to British Air Ministry records, very strong south-west winds (force 8) would have prohibited any non-seagoing craft from risking a Channel crossing.<ref name=Cox187>Cox, p. 187</ref>\n\n=== German intelligence ===\nAt least 20 spies were sent to England by boat or parachute to gather information on the British coastal defences under the codename \"Operation Lena\"; many of the agents spoke limited English. All agents were quickly captured and many were convinced to defect by [[MI5]]'s [[Double-Cross System]], providing disinformation to their German superiors. It has been suggested that the \"amateurish\" espionage efforts were a result of deliberate sabotage by the head of the army intelligence bureau in Hamburg, [[Herbert Wichmann]], in an effort to prevent a disastrous and costly amphibious invasion; Wichmann was critical of the Nazi regime and had close ties to [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the former head of the ''Abwehr'' who was later executed by the Nazis for treason.<ref>{{cite news\n| last        = Frenzel\n| first       = Eike\n| date        = 21 August 2014\n| title       = Hitlers Unternehmen \"Seel\u00f6we\": Invasion der Amateure\n| trans-title = Hitler's Operation \"Sea Lion\": Invasion of Amateurs\n| url         = http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/hitlers-unternehmen-seeloewe-die-invasion-die-nie-stattfand-a-986303.html\n| language    = de\n| journal     = [[Der Spiegel]]\n| location    = Hamburg\n| publisher   = Spiegel-Verlag\n| accessdate  = 21 August 2014\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203750/http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/hitlers-unternehmen-seeloewe-die-invasion-die-nie-stattfand-a-986303.html\n| archivedate = 21 August 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile some errors might not have caused problems, others, such as the inclusion of bridges that no longer existed<ref name=Wheeler-10>German Invasion Plans for the British Isles, Ed Rob Wheeler, [[Bodleian Library]] 2007, p. 10</ref> and misunderstanding the usefulness of minor British roads,<ref name=Wheeler-10 /> would have been detrimental to German operations, and would have added to the confusion caused by the layout of Britain's cities (with their maze of narrow roads and alleys){{clarify|date=May 2016}} and the removal of road signs.<ref>Wheeler, text of plate 7</ref>\n\n=== Post-war wargaming of the plan ===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Lion (wargame)}}\nA [[Operation Sea Lion (wargame)|1974 wargame]] was conducted at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/seelowe.txt\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 1 June 2006\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613114509/http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/seelowe.txt\n| archivedate = 13 June 2008\n}}</ref>  The controllers of the game assumed that the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} had not diverted its daytime operations into bombing London on 7 September 1940, but had continued its assault against RAF airbases in the South East. Consequently, the German High Command, relying on grossly overstated claims of RAF fighters shot down, were under the erroneous impression that by 19 September RAF front-line fighter strength had fallen to 140 (as against a true figure of over 700); and hence that effective German air superiority might shortly be achieved.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_JIBYcrqYoOdEVBS0dOWldlQ00/view|title = The Invaders reach Berkshire: Article from Daily Telegraph| accessdate  = 26 April 2019}}</ref> In the Game, the Germans were able to land almost all their first echelon forces on 22 September 1940, and established a beachhead in south-east England, capturing Folkestone, and [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]], albeit that the British had demolished the facilities of both ports.  The British army forces, delayed in moving units from East Anglia to the South East by bomb damage to the rail network south of London, were nevertheless able to hold onto positions in and around [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] and [[Dover]], sufficient to deny their use by German forces. Both the RAF and the Luftwaffe lost nearly a quarter of their available forces on the first day, after which it finally became apparent to the German command that British airpower was not, after all, on the point of collapse. On the second day a Royal Navy force of [[cruisers]] and [[destroyers]] was able to reach the [[English Channel|Channel]] from [[Rosyth]], in time to intercept and destroy most of the barges carrying the second and third echelon of German amphibious landings (for the game, these follow-up echelons had been held back from crossing the Channel on S minus one with the first echelon, instead sailing across on the night of S plus one). Without the second and third echelons, the forces ashore were cut off from reserves of artillery, vehicles, fuel and ammunition supplies; and blocked from further reinforcements. Isolated and facing fresh regular troops with armour and artillery, the invasion force was forced to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] after six days.<ref>The Sandhurst wargame was fictionalised in Richard Cox (ed.), ''Operation Sea Lion'' (London: Thornton Cox, 1974. {{ISBN|0-902726-17-X}}).

Following the [[Fall of France]], [[Adolf Hitler]], the German [[F\u00fchrer]] and [[Commander-in-chief|Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces]], hoped the British government would seek a peace agreement and he reluctantly considered invasion only as a last resort if all other options failed. \n\nHowever, once Hitler had determined that Germany would invade the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941, the desirability of forcing Britain out of the war before that date increased the attractiveness of an invasion, as potentially offering a quick and decisive victory in the West. As a precondition, Hitler specified the achievement of both [[air superiority|air]] and [[naval superiority]] over the [[English Channel]] and the proposed landing sites, but the German forces did not achieve either at any point during the war, and both [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|the German High Command]] and Hitler himself had serious doubts about the prospects for success. Nevertheless, both the German Army and Navy undertook a major programme of preparations for an invasion: training troops, developing specialised weapons and equipment, and modifying transport vessels. A large number of river barges and transport ships were gathered together on the Channel coast, but with Luftwaffe aircraft losses increasing in the Battle of Britain and no sign that the Royal Air Force had been defeated, Hitler postponed Sea Lion indefinitely on 17 September 1940 and it was never put into action.\n\n== Background ==\nAdolf Hitler hoped for a negotiated peace with the UK and made no preparations for [[amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on Britain until the Fall of France. At the time, the only forces with experience of, or modern equipment for, such landings were the Japanese, at the [[Battle of Wuhan]] in 1938.{{sfn|Deighton|1996|pp=23\u201326}}\n\n=== Outbreak of war and fall of Poland ===\nIn September 1939, the German [[invasion of Poland]] was a success, but this infringed on both [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|a French]] and [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|a British]] alliance with Poland and both countries declared war on Germany. On 9 October, Hitler's \"Directive No. 6 for the Conduct of the War\" planned an offensive to defeat these allies and \"win as much territory as possible in Holland, Belgium, and northern France to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England\".<ref name=\"Directive 6\">{{harvnb | Murray | 2002 | pp=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-2.html#fn28 32\u201333, 35]}}, [http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/06.html Directive No. 6 for the Conduct of the War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729073651/http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/06.html |date=29 July 2016 }}, Berlin, 9 October 1939</ref>\n\nWith the prospect of the Channel ports falling under ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (German Navy) control, Grand Admiral (''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'') [[Erich Raeder]] (head of the ''Kriegsmarine'') attempted to anticipate the obvious next step that might entail and instructed his operations officer, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See|Kapit\u00e4n]]'' [[Hansj\u00fcrgen Reinicke]], to draw up a document examining \"the possibility of troop landings in England should the future progress of the war make the problem arise\". Reinicke spent five days on this study and set forth the following prerequisites:\n* Eliminating or sealing off [[Royal Navy]] forces from the landing and approach areas.\n* Eliminating the [[Royal Air Force]].\n* Destroying all Royal Navy units in the coastal zone.\n* Preventing [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|British submarine]] action against the landing fleet.<ref name=Ansel43>Ansel, p.43</ref>\nOn 22 November 1939, the Head of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German Air Force) intelligence [[Joseph Schmid|Joseph \"Beppo\" Schmid]] presented his \"Proposal for the Conduct of Air Warfare\", which argued for a [[Blockade of Germany (1939\u201345)|counter to the British blockade]] and said \"Key is to paralyse the British trade\" by blocking imports to Britain and attacking seaports. The OKW (''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' or \"High Command of the Armed Forces\") considered the options and Hitler's 29 November \"Directive No. 9 \u2013 Instructions For Warfare Against The Economy of the Enemy\" stated that once the coast had been secured, the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Kriegsmarine'' were to [[blockade]] UK ports with sea mines, attack shipping and warships, and make air attacks on shore installations and industrial production. This directive remained in force in the first phase of the Battle of Britain.<ref name=\"Directive 9\">{{harvnb| Overy | 2013 | p=68}}, [http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/09.html Directive No. 9 \u2013 Instructions For Warfare Against The Economy of the Enemy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050359/http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/09.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, Berlin, 29 November 1939.</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in France 1939 O86.jpg|thumb|British soldiers in France in 1939]]\nIn December 1939, the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] issued its own study paper (designated ''Nordwest'') and solicited opinions and input from both ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe''. The paper outlined an assault on England's eastern coast between [[The Wash]] and the [[River Thames]] by troops crossing the [[North Sea]] from ports in the [[Low Countries]]. It suggested airborne troops as well as seaborne landings of 100,000 infantry in [[East Anglia]], transported by the ''Kriegsmarine'', which was also to prevent Royal Navy ships from getting through the Channel, while the ''Luftwaffe'' had to control airspace over the landings. The ''Kriegsmarine'' response was focused on pointing out the many difficulties to be surmounted if invading England was to be a viable option. It could not envisage taking on the Royal Navy [[Home Fleet]] and said it would take a year to organise shipping for the troops. ''[[Reichsmarschall]]'' [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], head of the ''Luftwaffe'', responded with a single-page letter in which he stated, \"[A] combined operation having the objective of landing in England must be rejected. It could only be the final act of an already victorious war against Britain as otherwise the preconditions for success of a combined operation would not be met\".<ref name=Ansel47-49>Ansel, pp.47\u201349</ref>{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n=== The fall of France ===\nGermany's swift and successful [[Battle of France|occupation of France and the Low Countries]] gained control of the Channel coast, facing what Schmid's 1939 report called their \"most dangerous enemy\". Raeder met Hitler on 21 May 1940 and raised the topic of invasion, but warned of the risks and expressed a preference for [[blockade]] by air, submarines and [[Commerce raiding|raiders]].{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=31\u201333}}{{sfn| Overy | 2013 | pp=68\u201369}}\n\nBy the end of May, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had become even more opposed to invading Britain following its costly victory in [[Norwegian campaign|Norway]]; after [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the ''Kriegsmarine'' had only one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers, and four destroyers available for operations.<ref>Murray, Williamson & Millet, Alan ''A War To Be Won'' (Harvard: Belknap Press, 2000), p.66.</ref> Raeder was strongly opposed to Sea Lion, for over half of ''Kriegsmarine'' surface fleet had been either sunk or badly damaged in ''Weser\u00fcbung'', and his service was hopelessly outnumbered by the ships of the Royal Navy.<ref>Murray & Millet, p.84.</ref> British parliamentarians still arguing for peace negotiations were defeated in the [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis]], but throughout July the Germans continued with attempts to find a diplomatic solution.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|pp=9\u201313}}\n\n=== Invasion planning ===\nIn a report presented on 30 June, OKW Chief of Staff [[Alfred Jodl]] reviewed options to increase pressure on Britain to agree to a negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the [[Royal Air Force]] and gain [[air supremacy]]. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air and the British economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike (\"''Todesstoss''\") after England had already been practically defeated, but could have a quick result.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=31\u201333}}{{sfn | Murray | 2002 | pp=[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/AAF-Luftwaffe/AAF-Luftwaffe-2.html#cn76 44\u201345]}} At a meeting that day, OKH Chief of General Staff [[Franz Halder]] heard from Secretary of State [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]] that Hitler had turned his attention to Russia. Halder met Admiral [[Otto Schniewind]] on 1 July, and they shared views without understanding each other's position. Both thought that air superiority was needed first, and could make the invasion unnecessary. They agreed that minefields and U-boats could limit the threat posed by the Royal Navy; Schniewind emphasised the significance of weather conditions.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=110}}\n\nOn 2 July, the OKW asked the services to start preliminary planning for an invasion, as Hitler had concluded that invasion would be achievable in certain conditions, the first of which was command of the air, and specifically asked the ''Luftwaffe'' when this would be achieved. On 4 July, after asking General [[Erich Marcks]] to begin planning an attack on Russia, Halder heard from the ''Luftwaffe'' that they planned to eliminate the RAF, destroying its aircraft manufacturing and supply systems, with damage to naval forces as a secondary aim. A ''Luftwaffe'' report presented to the OKW at a meeting on 11 July said that it would take 14 to 28 days to achieve air superiority. The meeting also heard that England was discussing an agreement with Russia. On the same day, Grand Admiral Raeder visited Hitler at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] to persuade him that the best way to pressure the British into a peace agreement would be a siege combining air and submarine attacks. Hitler agreed with him that invasion would be a last resort.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nJodl set out the OKW proposals for the proposed invasion in a memorandum issued on 12 July, which described operation L\u00f6we (Lion) as \"a river crossing on a broad front\", irritating the ''Kriegsmarine''. On 13 July, Hitler met Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch|von Brauchitsch]] and Halder at [[Berchtesgaden]] and they presented detailed plans prepared by the army on the assumption that the navy would provide safe transport.{{sfn|Bungay|2000|p= 111}} To the surprise of Von Brauchitsch and Halder, and completely at odds with his normal practice, Hitler did not ask any questions about specific operations, had no interest in details, and made no recommendations to improve the plans; instead he simply told OKW to start preparations.{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=105}}\n\n==== Directive No. 16: Operation Sea Lion ====\nOn 16 July 1940 Hitler issued [[F\u00fchrer Directive]] No. 16, setting in motion preparations for a landing in Britain. He prefaced the order by stating: \"As England, in spite of her hopeless military situation, still shows no signs of willingness to come to terms, I have decided to prepare, and if necessary to carry out, a landing operation against her. The aim of this operation is to eliminate the English Motherland as a base from which the war against Germany can be continued, and, if necessary, to occupy the country completely.\" The code name for the invasion was ''Seel\u00f6we'', \"Sea Lion\".<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 16\">{{cite web\n| title       = Directive No. 16 \u2013 On preparations for a landing operation against England\n| place       = F\u00fchrer Headquarters\n| date        = 16 July 1940\n| url         = http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_16.htm\n| accessdate  = 11 February 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194212/http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_16.htm\n| archivedate = 3 March 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=Cox159>Cox, p.159</ref>\n\nHitler's directive set four conditions for the invasion to occur:<ref name=Cox160>Cox, p.160</ref>\n* The RAF was to be \"beaten down in its morale and in fact, that it can no longer display any appreciable aggressive force in opposition to the German crossing\".\n* The English Channel was to be swept of British mines at the crossing points, and the [[Strait of Dover]] must be blocked at both ends by German mines.\n* The coastal zone between occupied France and England must be dominated by heavy artillery.\n* The [[Royal Navy]] must be sufficiently engaged in the [[North Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] so that it could not intervene in the crossing. British home squadrons must be damaged or destroyed by air and torpedo attacks.\n\nThis ultimately placed responsibility for Sea Lion{{'}}s success squarely on the shoulders of Raeder and G\u00f6ring, neither of whom had the slightest enthusiasm for the venture and, in fact, did little to hide their opposition to it.<ref name=Cox157>Cox, p.157</ref> Nor did Directive 16 provide for a combined operational headquarters, similar to the Allies' creation of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) for the later Normandy landings, under which all three service branches (Army, Navy, and Air Force) could work together to plan, co-ordinate, and execute such a complex undertaking.<ref name=Cox161>Cox, p.161</ref>\n\nThe invasion was to be on a broad front, from around [[Ramsgate]] to beyond the [[Isle of Wight]].\nPreparations, including overcoming the RAF, were to be in place by mid August.<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 16\" />{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=110\u2013111}}\n\n==== Discussion ====\nGrand Admiral Raeder sent a memorandum to OKW on 19 July, complaining about the onus placed on the navy in relation to the army and air force, and stating that the navy would be unable to achieve its objectives.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=111}}\n\nThe first joint services conference on the proposed invasion was held by Hitler in Berlin on 21 July, with Raeder, Field Marshal [[Walther von Brauchitsch|von Brauchitsch]], and ''Luftwaffe'' Chief of Staff [[Hans Jeschonnek]]. Hitler told them that the British had no hope of survival, and ought to negotiate, but were hoping to get Russia to intervene and halt German oil supplies. Invasion was very risky, and he asked them if direct attacks by air and submarine could take effect by mid September. Jeschonnek proposed large bombing attacks so that responding RAF fighters could be shot down. The idea that invasion could be a surprise \"river crossing\" was dismissed by Raeder, and the navy could not complete its preparations by mid August. Hitler wanted the air attack to commence early in August and, if it succeeded, the invasion was to start around 25 August before weather deteriorated. Hitler's main interest was the question of countering potential Russian intervention. Halder outlined his first thoughts on defeating Russian forces. Detailed plans were to be made to [[Operation Barbarossa|attack the Soviet Union]].{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nRaeder met Hitler on 25 July to report on navy progress: they were not sure if preparations could be completed during August: he was to present plans at a conference on 31 July. On 28 July he told OKW that ten days would be needed to get the first wave of troops across the Channel, even on a much narrower front. Planning was to resume. In his diary, [[Franz Halder|Halder]] noted that if what Raeder had said was true, \"all previous statements by the navy were so much rubbish and we can throw away the whole plan of invasion\". On the next day, Halder dismissed the navy's claims and required a new plan.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=113}}<ref>Burdick and Jacobsen 1988, p. 255.</ref>\n\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' announced on 29 July that they could begin a major air attack at the start of August, and their intelligence reports gave them confidence of a decisive result. Half of their bombers were to be kept in reserve to support the invasion. At a meeting with the army, the navy proposed delay until May 1941, when the new battleships [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] and [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] would be ready. A navy memorandum issued on 30 July said invasion would be vulnerable to the Royal Navy, and autumn weather could prevent necessary maintenance of supplies. The OKW assessed alternatives, including attacking the British in the Mediterranean, and favoured extended operations against England while remaining on good terms with Russia.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=113}}\n\nAt the Berghof conference on 31 July, the ''Luftwaffe'' were not represented. Raeder said barge conversions would take until 15 September, leaving the only possible 1940 invasion dates as 22\u201326 September, when weather was likely to be unsuitable. Landings would have to be on a narrow front, and would be better in spring 1941. Hitler wanted the invasion in September as the British army was increasing in strength. After Raeder left, Hitler told von Brauchitsch and Halder that the air attack was to start around 5 August; eight to fourteen days after that, he would decide on the landing operation. London was showing new-found optimism, and he attributed this to their hopes of intervention by Russia, which Germany was to attack in the spring of 1941.{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n==== Directive No. 17: air and sea warfare against England ====\n{{Main|Adlertag}}\nOn 1 August 1940, Hitler instructed intensified air and sea warfare to \"establish the necessary conditions for the final conquest of England\". From 5 August, subject to weather delays, the ''Luftwaffe'' was \"to overpower the English Air Force with all the forces at its command, in the shortest possible time.\" Attacks were then to be made on ports and food stocks, while leaving alone ports to be used in the invasion, and \"air attacks on enemy warships and merchant ships may be reduced except where some particularly favourable target happens to present itself.\" The ''Luftwaffe'' was to keep sufficient forces in reserve for the proposed invasion, and was not to target civilians without a direct order from Hitler in response to RAF terror bombing. No decision had been reached on the choice between immediate decisive action and a siege. The Germans hoped the air action would force the British to negotiate, and make invasion unnecessary.<ref name=\"F\u00fchrer Directive 17\">{{cite web\n| title       = Directive No. 17 \u2013 For the conduct of air and sea warfare against England\n| place       = F\u00fchrer Headquarters\n| date        = 1 August 1940\n| url         = http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_17.htm\n| accessdate  = 11 February 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201904/http://www.alternatewars.com/WW2/WW2_Documents/Fuhrer_Directives/FD_17.htm\n| archivedate = 3 March 2016\n}}</ref>{{sfn | Bungay | 2000 | p=114}}\n\n== Land forces ==\n{{Main|Operation Sea Lion order of battle}}\nIn the Army plan of 25 July 1940, the invasion force was to be organised into two [[army group]]s drawn from the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]], the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army]] and the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]]. The first wave of the landing would have consisted of eleven [[infantry]] and [[Mountain warfare|mountain]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], the second wave of eight [[Panzer division|panzer]] and [[motorised infantry]] divisions and finally, the third wave was formed of six further infantry divisions. The initial assault would have also included two [[Airborne forces|airborne]] divisions and the [[special forces]] of the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThis initial plan was vetoed by opposition from both the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe, who successfully argued that an amphibious force could only be assured air and naval protection if confined to a narrow front, and that the landing areas should be as far from Royal Navy bases as possible. The definitive order of battle adopted on 30 August 1940 envisaged a first wave of nine divisions from the 9th and 16th armies landing along four stretches of beach \u2014 two infantry divisions on beach 'B' between [[Folkestone]] and [[New Romney]] supported by a [[special forces]] company of the [[Brandenburgers|Brandenburg Regiment]], two infantry divisions on beach 'C' between [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Hastings]] supported by three battalions of submersible/floating tanks, two infantry divisions on beach 'D' between [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]] and [[Eastbourne]] supported by one battalion of submersible/floating tanks and a second company of the Brandenburg Regiment, and three infantry divisions on beach 'E' between [[Beachy Head]] and [[Brighton]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2014|p=315}} A single airborne division would land in Kent north of [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]; with the objective of seizing the aerodrome at [[RAF Lympne|Lympne]] and bridge-crossings over the [[Royal Military Canal]], and in assisting the ground forces in capturing [[Folkestone]].  Folkestone (to the east) and [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] (to the west) were the only cross-channel port facilities that would have been accessible to the invasion forces; and much depended on these being captured substantially intact or with the capability of rapid repair; in which case the second wave of eight divisions (including all the motorised and armoured divisions) might be unloaded directly onto their respective quaysides. A further six infantry divisions were allocated to the third wave.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=63}}\n\nThe order of battle defined on 30 August remained as the agreed overall plan, but was always considered as potentially subject to change if circumstances demanded it.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=66}} The Army High Command continued to press for a wider landing area if possible, against the opposition of the Kriegsmarine; in August they had won the concession that, if the opportunity arose, a force might be landed directly from ships onto the seafront at Brighton, perhaps supported by a second airborne force landing on the South Downs.  Contrariwise, the Kriegsmarine (fearful of possible fleet action against the invasion forces from Royal Navy ships in Portsmouth) insisted that the divisions enshipped from [[Cherbourg]] and [[Le Harvre]] for landing on beach 'E', might be diverted to any one of the other beaches where sufficient space allowed.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=247}}\n\nEach of the first wave landing forces was divided into three echelons. The first echelon, carried across the Channel on barges, coasters and small motor launches, would consist of the main infantry assault force. The second echelon, carried across the Channel in larger transport vessels, would consist predominantly of artillery, armoured vehicles and other heavy equipment. The third echelon, carried across the channel on barges, would consist of the vehicles, horses, stores and personnel of the division-level support services.  Loading of barges and transports with heavy equipment, vehicles and stores would start on S-tag minus nine (in Antwerp); and S minus eight in Dunkirk, with horses not loaded till S minus two. All troops would be loaded onto their barges from French or Belgian ports on S minus two or S minus one.  The first echelon would land on the beaches on S-tag itself, preferably at daybreak around two hours after high tide.  The barges used for the first echelon would be retrieved by tugs on the afternoon of S-tag, and those still in working order would be drawn up alongside the transport vessels to trans-ship the second echelon overnight, so that much of the second echelon and third echelon could land on S plus one, with the remainder on S plus two.  The Navy intended that all four invasion fleets would return across the Channel on the night of S plus two, having been moored for three full days off the South coast of England. The Army had sought to have the third echelon cross in later separate convoys to avoid men and horses having to wait for as long as four days and nights in their barges, but the Kriegsmarine were insistent that they could only protect the four fleets from Royal Navy attack if all vessels crossed the Channel together.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=248}}\n\nIn the summer of 1940, UK [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|Home Forces Command]] tended to consider [[East Anglia]] and the East coast to be the most likely landing sites for a German invasion force, as this would have offered much greater opportunities to seize ports and natural harbours, and would be further from naval forces at [[Portsmouth]]. But then the accumulation of invasion barges in French ports from late August 1940 rather indicated a landing on the South coast.  Consequently, the main Home Forces mobile reserve force was held back around London, so as to be able to move forwards to protect the capital, either into Kent or Essex.  Hence, Sea Lion landings in Kent and Sussex would have been initially opposed by [[XII Corps (United Kingdom)|XII Corps]] of [[Eastern Command (United Kingdom)|Eastern Command]] with three infantry divisions and two independent brigades and [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]] of [[Southern Command (United Kingdom)|Southern Command]] with three infantry divisions. In reserve were two more Corps under [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|GHQ Home Forces]]; located south of London was the [[VII Corps (United Kingdom)|VII Corps]] with the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]], an armoured division and an independent armoured brigade, while north of London was [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|IV Corps]] with an armoured division, infantry division and independent infantry brigade.{{sfn|Collier|1962|pp=219-220}}\n\n== Air power ==\n\n=== Airborne Forces ===\n\nThe success of the German [[Norwegian Campaign|invasion of Denmark and Norway]], on 9 April 1940, had relied extensively on the use of paratroop and glider-borne formations (''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'') to capture key defensive points in advance of the main invasion forces. The same airborne tactics had also been used in support of the invasions of [[Battle of Belgium|Belgium]] and the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] on 10 May 1940. However, although spectacular success had been achieved in the airborne assault on [[Fort Eben-Emael]] in Belgium, German airborne forces had come close to disaster in their attempt to seize the Dutch government and capital of [[Battle for The Hague|The Hague]]. Around 1,300 of the [[22nd Air Landing Division (Wehrmacht)|22nd Air Landing Division]] had been captured (subsequently shipped to Britain as [[prisoners of war]]), around 250 [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport aircraft had been lost, and several hundred elite paratroops and air-landing infantry had been killed or injured. Consequently, even in September 1940 the Luftwaffe had the capacity to provide only around 3,000 airborne troops to participate in the first wave of Operation Sea Lion.\n\n=== Battle of Britain ===\n{{Main|Battle of Britain}}\n[[File:Winston Churchill visiting bomb-damaged areas of the East End of London, 8 September 1940.

In addition, wider raids gave aircrew experience of day and night navigation, and tested the defences.<ref>{{Cite news\n| url         = http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/german-history-of-world-war-ii/world-war-two-battles/battle-britain/operation-sea-lion/\n| title       = Operation Sea Lion\n| date        = 13 February 2018\n| work        = Historical Society of German Military History \u2013 Historische Gesellschaft der deutschen Milit\u00e4rgeschichte\n| access-date = 7 March 2018\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180307151117/http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/german-history-of-world-war-ii/world-war-two-battles/battle-britain/operation-sea-lion/\n| archivedate = 7 March 2018\n}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} On 13 August, the German ''Luftwaffe'' began a series of concentrated aerial attacks (designated ''Unternehmen Adlerangriff'' or [[Operation Eagle Attack]]) on targets throughout the United Kingdom in an attempt to destroy the RAF and establish air superiority over [[Great Britain]].  The change in emphasis of the bombing from [[List of Royal Air Force stations|RAF bases]] to [[the Blitz|bombing London]], however, turned ''Adlerangriff'' into a short-range [[strategic bombing]] operation.\n\nThe effect of the switch in strategy is disputed. Some historians argue the change in strategy lost the Luftwaffe the opportunity of winning the air battle, or air superiority.<ref>Wood and Dempster 2003, pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> Others argue the ''Luftwaffe'' achieved little in the air battle and the RAF was not on the verge of collapse, as often claimed.<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 368\u2013369.</ref> Another perspective has also been put forward, which suggests the Germans could not have gained air superiority before the weather window closed.<ref>Hooton 2010, p. 80.</ref> Others have said that it was unlikely the ''Luftwaffe'' would ever have been able to destroy [[RAF Fighter Command]]. If British losses became severe, the RAF could simply have withdrawn northward and regrouped. It could then deploy when, or if, the Germans launched an invasion. Most historians agree Sea Lion would have failed regardless, because of the weaknesses of German sea power, compared to the Royal Navy.<ref>Corum 1997, pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\n=== Limitations of the ''Luftwaffe'' ===\n{{See also|Aircraft of the Battle of Britain}}\nThe track record of the ''Luftwaffe'' against naval combat vessels up to that point in the war was poor. In the [[Norwegian Campaign]], despite eight weeks of continuous air supremacy, the ''Luftwaffe'' sank only two British warships. The German aircrews were not trained or equipped to attack fast-moving naval targets, particularly agile naval destroyers or [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTB). The Luftwaffe also lacked armour-piercing bombs<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=3l_vg1p5EHsC&pg=PA374\n| title      = World War II: Crucible of the Contemporary World : Commentary and Readings \u2013 Google Books\n| accessdate = 8 April 2013\n| isbn = 9780873327312\n| last1 = Lee\n| first1 = Loyd E.\n| last2 = Lee\n| first2 = Lily Xiao Hong\n| year = 1991\n}}</ref> and their only [[aerial torpedo]] capability, essential for defeating larger warships, consisted of a small number of slow and vulnerable [[Heinkel He 115]] floatplanes. The ''Luftwaffe'' made 21 deliberate attacks on small torpedo boats during the Battle of Britain, sinking none. The British had between 700 and 800 small coastal craft (MTBs, [[Motor Gun Boat]]s and smaller vessels), making them a critical threat if the ''Luftwaffe'' could not deal with the force. Only nine MTBs were lost to air attack out of 115 sunk by various means throughout the [[Second World War]]. Only nine destroyers were sunk by air attack in 1940, out of a force of over 100 operating in British waters at the time. Only five were sunk while [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuating Dunkirk]], despite large periods of German air superiority, thousands of sorties flown, and hundreds of tons of bombs dropped. The ''Luftwaffe'''s record against merchant shipping was also  unimpressive: it sank only one in every 100 British vessels passing through British waters in 1940, and most of this total was achieved using mines.<ref>Larew 1992, pp. 245\u2013247.</ref>\n\n==== ''Luftwaffe'' Special Equipment ====\nHad an invasion taken place, the [[Bf 110]] equipped ''[[Erprobungsgruppe 210]]'' would have dropped ''[[Seilbomb]]en'' just prior to the landings. This was a secret weapon which would have been used to blackout the electricity network in South-east England. The equipment for dropping the wires was fitted to the [[Bf 110]] aeroplanes and tested. It involved dropping wires across high voltage wires, and was probably as dangerous to the aircraft crews as to the British.<ref>Messerschmitt Bf 110 Bombsights Over England: Erprobungsgruppe 210 in the Battle of Britain by John Vasco</ref> However, there was no national electricity network in the UK at this time, only the local generation of electricity for each city/town and surrounding area.\n\n=== Italian air force ===\nUpon hearing of Hitler's intentions, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], through his Foreign Minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]], quickly offered up to ten divisions and thirty squadrons of Italian aircraft for the proposed invasion.<ref name=Cox158>Cox, p.158</ref> Hitler initially declined any such aid but eventually allowed a small contingent of Italian fighters and bombers, the Italian Air Corps (''[[Corpo Aereo Italiano]]'' or CAI), to assist in the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s aerial campaign over Britain in October and November 1940.<ref>Macksey, Kenneth, ''Beda Fomm:  The Classic Victory'', p. 35.

The ''Kriegsmarine'', already numerically far inferior to Britain's Royal Navy, had lost a sizeable portion of its large modern surface units in April 1940 during the [[Norwegian Campaign]], either as complete losses or due to battle damage. In particular, the loss of two light cruisers and ten destroyers was crippling, as these were the very warships most suited to operating in the Channel narrows where the invasion would likely take place.<ref name=\"Von der Porten111\">Von der Porten, p.111</ref> Most [[U-boat]]s, the most powerful arm of the {{lang|de|Kriegsmarine}}, were meant for destroying ships, not supporting an invasion.\n\nAlthough the Royal Navy could not bring the whole of its naval superiority to bear\u2014as most of the fleet was engaged in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], and a substantial proportion had been detached to support [[Operation Menace]] against [[Dakar]]\u2014the British [[Home Fleet]] still had a very large advantage in numbers. It was debatable whether British ships were as vulnerable to enemy air attack as the Germans hoped. During the [[Operation Dynamo|Dunkirk evacuation]], few warships were actually sunk, despite being stationary targets. The overall disparity between the opposing naval forces made the amphibious invasion plan extremely risky, regardless of the outcome in the air. In addition, the ''Kriegsmarine'' had allocated its few remaining larger and more modern ships to diversionary operations in the [[North Sea]].\n\nThe fleet of defeated France, one of the most powerful and modern in the world, might have tipped the balance against Britain if it had been captured by the Germans. However, the pre-emptive destruction of a large part of the French fleet by the British [[attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]], and the [[scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon|scuttling of the remainder by the French themselves at Toulon two years later]], ensured that this could not happen.\n\nThe view of those who believed, regardless of a potential German victory in the air battle, that Sea Lion was still not going to succeed included a number of German General Staff members. After the war, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] said he believed air superiority was \"not enough\". D\u00f6nitz stated, \"[W]e possessed neither control of the air or the sea; nor were we in any position to gain it\".<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997 edition), p. 114.</ref> In his memoirs, [[Erich Raeder]], commander-in-chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in 1940, argued:\n{{quote|.....the emphatic reminder that up until now the British had never thrown the full power of their fleet into action. However, a German invasion of England would be a matter of life and death for the British, and they would unhesitatingly commit their naval forces, to the last ship and the last man, into an all-out fight for survival. Our Air Force could not be counted on to guard our transports from the British Fleets, because their operations would depend on the weather, if for no other reason. It could not be expected that even for a brief period our Air Force could make up for our lack of naval supremacy.<ref>Raeder 2001, pp. 324\u2013325.</ref>}}\n\nOn 13 August 1940, [[Alfred Jodl]], Chief of Operations in the [[OKW]] (''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht'') wrote his \"Assessment of the situation arising from the views of the Army and Navy on a landing in England.\" His first point was that \"The landing operation must under no circumstances fail. A failure could leave political consequences, which would go far beyond the military ones.\" He believed that the ''Luftwaffe'' could meet its essential objectives, but if the ''Kriegsmarine'' could not meet the operational requirements of the Army for an attack on a broad front with two divisions landed within four days, followed promptly by three further divisions irrespective of weather, \"then I consider the landing to be an act of desperation, which would have to be risked in a desperate situation, but which we have no reason whatsoever to undertake at this moment.\"{{sfn| Evans| Mcgeoch|2014|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n=== Minefields ===\n\nLacking surface naval forces capable of meeting the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy in open battle, the main seaborne defence for the first wave invasion fleets would be four massive minefields; which were intended to be laid from S minus nine onwards.  The ANTON minefield (off [[Selsey Bill]]) and  the BRUNO minefield (off [[Beachy Head]]), each totalling over 3,000 mines in four rows, would block off the invasion beaches against naval forces from Portsmouth; while the counterpart CAESAR minefield would block off beach 'B' from Dover.  A fourth minefield, DORA, was to be laid off [[Lyme Bay]] to inhibit naval forces from [[Plymouth]].  By the autumn of 1940, the Kriegsmarine had achieved considerable success in laying minefields in support of active operations, notably in the night of [[Texel Disaster|31 August 1940]] when the 20th Destroyer flotilla suffered heavy losses when running into a newly laid German minefield off Texel.\n\n=== Landing craft ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1369-10A, Wilhelmshaven, Prahme f\u00fcr \"Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we\".jpg|thumb|Invasion barges assembled at the German port of [[Wilhelmshaven]].]]\nIn 1940 the German Navy was ill-prepared for mounting an amphibious assault the size of Operation Sea Lion. Lacking purpose-built landing craft and both doctrinal and practical experience with amphibious warfare, the ''Kriegsmarine'' was largely starting from scratch. Some efforts had been made during the inter-war years to investigate landing military forces by sea, but inadequate funding severely limited any useful progress.<ref name=Schenk22-25>Schenk, pp.22\u201325</ref>\n\nFor the successful [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]], German naval forces (assisted in places by thick fog) had simply forced an entry into key Norwegian harbours with motor launches and [[E-boats]] against stiff resistance from the outgunned Norwegian army and navy, and then unloaded troops from destroyers and troop transports directly onto the dockfronts at [[Bergen]], [[Egersund]], [[Trondheim]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Arendal]] and Horten.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=71}} At [[Stavanger]] and [[Oslo]] capture of the port was preceded by landing airborne forces.  No beach landings were attempted.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-2781-19, Russland, Landungsboot mit Zugkraftwagen.jpg|thumb|left|A {{Interlanguage link multi|Pionierlandungsboot|de}}.]]\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' had taken some small steps in remedying the landing craft situation with construction of the ''[[Pionierlandungsboot 39]]'' (Engineer Landing Boat 39), a self-propelled shallow-draft vessel which could carry 45 infantrymen, two light vehicles or 20 tons of cargo and land on an open beach, unloading via a pair of clamshell doors at the bow. But by late September 1940 only two prototypes had been delivered.<ref name=Schenk29>Schenk, p.29</ref>\n\nRecognising the need for an even larger craft capable of landing both tanks and infantry onto a hostile shore, the ''Kriegsmarine'' began development of the 220-ton ''[[Marinef\u00e4hrprahm]]'' (MFP) but these too were unavailable in time for a landing on British soil in 1940, the first of them not being commissioned until April 1941.\n\nGiven barely two months to assemble a large seagoing invasion fleet, the ''Kriegsmarine'' opted to convert inland river barges into makeshift landing craft. Approximately 2,400 barges were collected from throughout Europe (860 from Germany, 1,200 from the Netherlands and Belgium and 350 from France). Of these, only about 800 were powered albeit insufficiently to cross the Channel under their own power. All barges would be towed across by tugs, with two barges to a tug in line abreast, preferably one being powered and one unpowered.  On reaching the English coast, the powered barges would be cast-off, to beach themselves under their own power; the unpowered barges would be taken inshore as far as possible by the tugs and anchored, so as to settle on the falling tide, their troops unloading some hours later than those on the powered barges.<ref name=Schenk67>Schenk, p.67</ref>  Accordingly, the Sea Lion plans were prepared on the basis that the landings would take place shortly after high tide and on a date when this coincided with sunrise. Towards evening, on the following rising tide, the empty barges would have been retrieved by their tugs to receive the second echelon forces, stores and heavy equipment in the awaiting transport vessels. These transport vessels would have remained moored off the beach throughout the day.  By contrast, the Allied [[D day]] landings in 1944 were timed to happen at low tide; with all troops and equipment transhipped from their transport vessels to landing craft off-shore overnight.\n\nAll the troops intended to land at beach 'E', the westernmost of the four beaches, would cross the channel in larger transport vessels - the barges being towed loaded with equipment but empty of troops - and would then be transferred onto their barges a short distance from the beach.  For the landings on the other three beaches, the first echelon of the invasion forces (and their equipment) would be loaded onto their barges in French or Belgian ports, while the second echelon force crossed the channel in associated transport vessels. Once the first echelon had been unloaded onto the beach, the barges would return to the transport vessels to transport the second echelon. The same procedure was envisaged for the second wave (unless the first wave had captured a usable port). Trials showed that this process of trans-shipment in open sea, in any circumstances other than flat calm, would likely take at least 14 hours,{{sfn|McKinstry|2014|p=307}} such that the disembarkation of the first wave might extend over several tides and several days, with barges and invasion fleet subsequently needing to be escorted together back across the Channel for repairs and reloading. Since loading of the tanks, vehicles and stores of the second wave onto the returned barges and transport ships would take at least a week, the second wave could not be expected to land much less than ten days after the first wave, and more likely longer still.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|p=249}}\n\n==== Barge types ====\nTwo types of inland river barge were generally available in Europe for use in Sea Lion: the ''peniche'', which was 38.5 meters long and carried 360 tons of cargo, and the ''Kampine'', which was 50 meters long and carried 620 tons of cargo. Of the barges collected for the invasion, 1,336 were classified as ''peniches'' and 982 as ''Kampinen''. For simplicity's sake, the Germans designated any barge up to the size of a standard ''peniche'' as Type A1 and anything larger as Type A2.<ref name=Schenk65-74>Schenk, pp.65\u201374</ref>\n\n==== Type A ====\nConverting the assembled barges into landing craft involved cutting an opening in the bow for off-loading troops and vehicles, welding longitudinal I-beams and transverse braces to the hull to improve seaworthiness, adding a wooden internal ramp and pouring a concrete floor in the hold to allow for tank transport. As modified, the Type A1 barge could accommodate three medium tanks while the Type A2 could carry four.<ref name=Schenk99>Schenk, p.99</ref>  Tanks, armoured vehicles and artillery were envisaged as crossing the Channel in one of around 170 transport ships, which would be anchored off the landing beaches while the barges disembarked the first echelon of assault troops; those in powered barges disembarking soonest.  The empty barges would then have been retrieved by tugs on the following rising tide, so as to have the second echelon (including tanks and other heavy equipment) loaded onto them using ship's [[derrick]]s. Barges would consequently have shuttled between ships and beaches over at least two days before being assembled together for the escorted night-time return voyage across the Channel.\n\n==== Type B ====\nThis barge was a Type A altered to carry and rapidly off-load the submersible tanks (''Tauchpanzer'') developed for use in Sea Lion. They had the advantage of being able to unload their tanks directly into water up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} in depth, several hundred yards from shore, whereas the unmodified Type A had to be firmly grounded on the beach, making it more vulnerable to enemy fire. The Type B required a longer external ramp (11 meters) with a float attached to the front of it. Once the barge anchored, the crew would extend the internally stowed ramp using block and tackle sets until it was resting on the water's surface. As the first tank rolled forward onto the ramp, its weight would tilt the forward end of the ramp into the water and push it down onto the seabed. Once the tank rolled off, the ramp would bob back up to a horizontal position, ready for the next one to exit. If a barge was securely grounded along its full length, the longer ramp could also be used to discharge submersible tanks directly onto the beach, and beachmasters were given the option of landing tanks by this method, if the risk of loss in submersible running appeared to be too high.  The Navy High Command increased its initial order for 60 of these vessels to 70 in order to compensate for expected losses. A further five were ordered on 30 September as a reserve.<ref name=Schenk99-105>Schenk, pp.99\u2013105</ref>\n\n==== Type C ====\nThe Type C barge was specifically converted to carry the [[Panzer II]] amphibious tank (''Schwimmpanzer''). Because of the extra width of the floats attached to this tank, cutting a broad exit ramp into the bow of the barge was not considered advisable as it would have compromised the vessel's seaworthiness to an unacceptable degree. Instead, a large hatch was cut into the stern, thereby allowing the tanks to drive directly into deep water before turning under their own motive power and heading towards shore. The Type C barge could accommodate up to four ''Schwimmpanzern'' in its hold. Approximately 14 of these craft were available by the end of September.<ref name=Schenk105-107>Schenk, pp.105\u2013107</ref>\n\n==== Type AS ====\nDuring the planning stages of Sea Lion, it was deemed desirable to provide the advanced infantry detachments (making the initial landings) with greater protection from small-arms and light artillery fire by lining the sides of a powered Type A barge with concrete. Wooden slides were also installed along the barge's hull to accommodate ten assault boats (''Sturmboote''), each capable of carrying six infantrymen and powered by a 30&nbsp;hp outboard motor. The extra weight of this additional armour and equipment reduced the barge's load capacity to 40 tons. By mid-August, 18 of these craft, designated Type AS, had been converted, and another five were ordered on 30 September.<ref name=\"Schenk99\" />\n\n==== Type AF ====\nThe ''Luftwaffe'' had formed its own special command (''Sonderkommando'') under Major Fritz Siebel to investigate the production of landing craft for Sea Lion. Major Siebel proposed giving the unpowered Type A barges their own motive power by installing a pair of surplus {{convert|600|hp|PS kW|abbr=on}} BMW aircraft engines, driving propellers. The ''Kriegsmarine'' was highly sceptical of this venture, but the ''Heer'' (Army) high command enthusiastically embraced the concept and Siebel proceeded with the conversions.<ref name=Schenk94-98>Schenk, pp.94\u201398</ref>\n\nThe aircraft engines were mounted on a platform supported by iron scaffolding at the aft end of the vessel. Cooling water was stored in tanks mounted above-deck. As completed, the Type AF had a speed of six knots, and a range of 60 nautical miles unless auxiliary fuel tanks were fitted. Disadvantages of this set-up included an inability to back the vessel astern, limited manoeuvrability and the deafening noise of the engines which would have made voice commands problematic.<ref name=\"Schenk94-98\" />\n\nBy 1 October 128 Type A barges had been converted to airscrew propulsion and, by the end of the month, this figure had risen to over 200.<ref name=Schenk95>Schenk, p.95</ref>\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' later used some of the motorised Sea Lion barges for landings on the Russian-held Baltic islands in 1941 and, though most of them were eventually returned to the inland rivers they originally plied, a reserve was kept for military transport duties and for filling out amphibious flotillas.<ref name=Schenk94>Schenk, p.94</ref>\n\n== Army ==\n\n=== Panzers ashore ===\nProviding armour support for the initial wave of assault troops was a critical concern for Sea Lion planners, and much effort was devoted to finding practical ways of rapidly getting tanks onto the invasion beaches in support of the first echelon. Though the Type A barges could disembark several medium tanks onto an open beach, this could be accomplished only once the tide had fallen further and the barges were firmly grounded along their full length; otherwise a leading tank might topple off an unsteady ramp and block those behind from deployment. The time needed for assembling the external ramps also meant that both the tanks and the ramp assembly crews would be exposed to close-quarter enemy fire for a considerable time. A safer and faster method was needed and the Germans eventually settled on providing some tanks with floats and making others fully submersible.  It was nevertheless recognised that a high proportion of these specialised tanks might be expected not to make it off the beach.\n\n==== ''Schwimmpanzer'' ====\nThe ''Schwimmpanzer'' II [[Panzer II]], at 8.9 tons, was light enough to float with the attachment of long rectangular buoyancy boxes on each side of the tank's hull. The boxes were machined from aluminium stock and filled with Kapok sacks for added buoyancy. Motive power came from the tank's own tracks which were connected by rods to a propeller shaft running through each float. The ''Schwimmpanzer'' II could make 5.7&nbsp;km/h in the water. An inflatable rubber hose around the turret ring created a waterproof seal between the hull and turret. The tank's 2&nbsp;cm gun and coaxial machinegun were kept operational and could be fired while the tank was still making its way ashore. Because of the great width of the pontoons, ''Schwimmpanzer'' IIs were to be deployed from specially-modified Type C landing barges, from which they could be launched directly into open water from a large hatch cut into the stern. The Germans converted 52 of these tanks to amphibious use prior to Sea Lion's cancellation.<ref name=Schenk113>Schenk, p.113</ref>\n\n==== ''Tauchpanzer'' ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-5674-45, \u00dcbungen mit Panzer III f\u00fcr Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Panzer III]] ''Tauchpanzer'' under test (1940)]]\nThe ''Tauchpanzer'' or [[Deep fording|deep-wading]] tank (also referred to as the ''U-Panzer'' or ''Unterwasser Panzer'') was a standard [[Panzer III]] or [[Panzer IV]] medium tank with its hull made completely waterproof by sealing all sighting ports, hatches and air intakes with tape or caulk. The gap between the turret and hull was sealed with an inflatable hose while the main gun mantlet, commander's cupola and radio operator's machine gun were given special rubber coverings. Once the tank reached the shore, all covers and seals could be blown off via explosive cables, enabling normal combat operation.<ref name=Schenk111>Schenk, p.111</ref>\n\nFresh air for both the crew and engine was drawn into the tank via an 18&nbsp;m long rubber hose to which a float was attached to keep one end above the water's surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal [[bilge]] pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional [[gyrocompass]] or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.<ref name=\"Schenk111\" />\n\nExperiments conducted at the end of June and early July at Schilling, near [[Wilhelmshaven]], showed that the submersible tanks functioned best when they were kept moving along the seabed as, if halted for any reason, they tended to sink into the seabed and remain stuck there. Obstacles such as underwater trenches or large rocks tended to stop the tanks in their tracks, and it was decided for this reason that they should be landed at high tide so that any mired tanks could be retrieved at low tide. Submersible tanks could operate in water up to a depth of {{convert|15|m|ft|0}}.<ref name=Schenk110-111>Schenk, pp.110\u2013111</ref>\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' initially expected to use 50 specially-converted motor coasters to transport the submersible tanks, but testing with the coaster ''Germania'' showed this to be impractical. This was due to the ballast needed to offset the weight of the tanks, and the requirement that the coasters be grounded to prevent them from capsizing as the tanks were transferred by crane onto the vessel's wooden side ramps. These difficulties led to development of the Type B barge.<ref name=\"Schenk110-111\" />\n\nBy the end of August the Germans had converted 160 Panzer IIIs, 42 Panzer IVs, and 52 Panzer IIs to amphibious use. This gave them a paper strength of 254 machines, about an equivalent number to those that would otherwise have been allocated to an armoured division. The tanks were divided into four battalions or detachments labelled ''Panzer-Abteilung'' A, B, C and D. They were to carry sufficient fuel and ammunition for a combat radius of 200&nbsp;km.<ref name=Evans121>Evans, p.121</ref>\n\n=== Specialised landing equipment ===\nAs part of a ''Kriegsmarine'' competition, prototypes for a prefabricated \"heavy landing bridge\" or [[jetty]] (similar in function to later Allied [[Mulberry Harbour]]s) were designed and built by [[Krupp]] Stahlbau and Dortmunder Union and successfully overwintered in the North Sea in 1941\u201342.<ref name=Bonnard>Alderney at War. Brian Bonnard. 1993.{{ISBN|0-7509-0343-0}}. pp106-108. Alan Sutton Publishing.</ref> Krupp's design won out, as it only required one day to install, as opposed to twenty-eight days for the Dortmunder Union bridge. The Krupp bridge consisted of a series of 32m-long connecting platforms, each supported on the seabed by four steel columns. The platforms could be raised or lowered by heavy-duty winches in order to accommodate the tide. The German Navy initially ordered eight complete Krupp units composed of six platforms each. This was reduced to six units by the autumn of 1941, and eventually cancelled altogether when it became apparent that Sea Lion would never take place.<ref name=Schenk139>Schenk, p.139</ref>\n\nIn mid-1942, both the Krupp and Dortmunder prototypes were shipped to the [[Channel Islands]] and installed together off [[Alderney]], where they were used for unloading materials needed to fortify the island. Referred to as the \"German jetty\" by local inhabitants, they remained standing for the next thirty-six years until demolition crews finally removed them in 1978\u201379, a testament to their durability.<ref name=Schenk139 />\n\nThe [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] developed a portable landing bridge of its own nicknamed ''Seeschlange'' (Sea Snake). This \"floating roadway\"  was formed from a series of joined modules that could be towed into place to act as a temporary jetty. Moored ships could then either unload their cargo directly onto the roadbed or lower it down onto waiting vehicles via their heavy-duty booms. The ''Seeschlange'' was successfully tested by the Army Training Unit at [[Le Havre]] in France in the autumn of 1941 and later chosen for use in ''[[Operation Herkules]]'', the proposed Italo-German invasion of [[Malta]]. It was easily transportable by rail.<ref name=Schenk139 />\n\nA specialised vehicle intended for Sea Lion was the ''[[Landwasserschlepper]]'' (LWS), an amphibious tractor under development since 1935. It was originally intended for use by Army engineers to assist with river crossings. Three of them were assigned to Tank Detachment 100 as part of the invasion; it was intended to use them for pulling ashore unpowered assault barges and towing vehicles across the beaches. They would also have been used to carry supplies directly ashore during the six hours of falling tide when the barges were grounded. This involved towing a ''[[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]]'' amphibious trailer capable of transporting 10\u201320 tons of freight behind the LWS.<ref name=Schenk132-133>Schenk, pp.132\u2013133</ref> The LWS was demonstrated to General Halder on 2 August 1940 by the Reinhardt Trials Staff on the island of [[Sylt]] and, though he was critical of its high silhouette on land, he recognised the overall usefulness of the design. It was proposed to build enough tractors that one or two could be assigned to each invasion barge, but the late date and difficulties in mass-producing the vehicle prevented this.<ref name=\"Schenk132-133\" />\n\n=== Other equipment to be used for the first time ===\n\nOperation Sea Lion would have been the first ever amphibious invasion by a mechanised army, and the largest amphibious invasion since [[Gallipoli]]. The Germans had to invent and improvise a lot of equipment. They also proposed to use some new weapons and use upgrades of their existing equipment for the first time. These included:\n\n# New [[antitank gun]]s and [[Armor-piercing ammunition|ammunition]]. The standard German antitank gun, the 37&nbsp;mm [[Pak 36]], was capable of penetrating the armour of all 1940 British tanks except the [[Matilda II tank|Matilda]] and [[Valentine tank|Valentine]]. Armour-piercing ballistic capped (tungsten-cored) ammunition (Pzgr. 40) for 37&nbsp;mm Pak 36 had become available in time for the invasion.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://www.littlewars.se/sealion/germanweapons.html\n| title       = German Weapons \u2013 Operation Sealion (Seel\u00f6we) \u2013 The German Invasion of Britain 1940\n| website     = littlewars.se\n| accessdate  = 28 April 2018\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180428145550/http://www.littlewars.se/sealion/germanweapons.html\n| archivedate = 28 April 2018\n}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} The 37&nbsp;mm Pzgr.40 would still have had trouble penetrating the Matilda II's armour<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/ww2pen3.pdf\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 10 May 2013\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20170216085132/http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/ww2pen3.pdf\n| archivedate = 16 February 2017\n}}</ref> so the first echelon units replaced theirs with French or Czechoslovak 47&nbsp;mm guns (which weren't much better).<ref>Schenk p.183</ref> The [[Pak 36]] began to be replaced by the 50&nbsp;mm [[Pak 38]] in mid-1940. The [[Pak 38]], which could penetrate a Matilda's armour, would probably have seen action first with Sea Lion as it would have been issued initially to the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'' and the ''Heer'''s elite units, and all those units were in the Sea Lion force.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} These included the ''[[SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]]'' regiment, the ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'' regiment, 2 mountain, 2 ''J\u00e4ger'', 2 ''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'', 4 panzer, and 2 motorised divisions. In addition, the 7th Infantry division was considered one of the best in the ''Heer'', and the 35th almost as good.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n# Captured French armoured tractors.<ref>p. 183 Schenk</ref> The use of these tractors by the first wave units was intended to reduce their dependence upon horses and probably would have reduced the problems of getting supplies off the beaches. In addition to their proposed use on the beaches, the Germans later used them as tractors for antitank guns and munitions carriers, as self-propelled guns, and as armoured personnel carriers. There were two main types. The [[Renault UE Chenillette]] (German name: ''Infanterie Schlepper UE 630 (f)'') was a light tracked armoured carrier and prime mover produced by France between 1932 and 1940. Five to six thousand were built, and about 3,000 were captured and overhauled by the Germans.<ref>[[Anthony Tucker-Jones]], ''Hitler's Great Panzer Heist'', Pen & Sword Books, 2007, p.59 & p. 155</ref> They had a storage compartment that could carry 350&nbsp;kg, pull a trailer weighing 775&nbsp;kg for a total of about 1000&nbsp;kg, and could climb a 50% slope. The armour was 5\u20139&nbsp;mm, enough to stop shell fragments and bullets. There was also the [[Lorraine 37L]], which was larger, of which 360 fell into German hands. In that vehicle a load of 810 kilograms could be carried, plus a 690&nbsp;kg trailer pulled for a total of 1.5 tonnes. The use of such captured equipment meant that the first wave divisions were largely motorised,<ref>Schenk p. 183</ref> with the first wave using 9.3% (4,200) of the 45,000 horses normally required.<ref>Peter Fleming says on page 229 that the number of horses was reduced to 4,200 for the first wave (466 per division) and 7,000 for the second wave.</ref>\n# 48\u00d7 [[Stug III]] Ausf B Assault Guns- 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 37 L/24, 50&nbsp;mm armour and improved suspension.

This was far in excess of what the ''Kriegsmarine'' could supply, and final plans were more modest, calling for nine [[division (military)|divisions]] to make an [[amphibious assault]] on [[Sussex]] and Kent with around 67,000 men in the first [[echelon formation|echelon]] and a single [[airborne forces|airborne]] division of 3,000 men to support them.<ref name=Schenk231>Schenk, p.231</ref> The chosen invasion sites ran from [[Rottingdean]] in the west to [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] in the east.\n\nThe ''Kriegsmarine'' wanted a front as short as possible, as it regarded this as more defensible. Admiral Raeder wanted a front stretching from [[Dover]] to [[Eastbourne]] and stressed that shipping between [[Cherbourg]]/Le Havre and Dorset would be exposed to attacks from the Royal Navy based in [[Portsmouth]] and [[Plymouth]]. General Halder rejected this: \"From the army's point of view I regard it as complete suicide, I might just as well put the troops that have landed straight through the sausage machine\".<ref>Shears, David. ''Operation Sealion'',<!--publisher & place?--> p.162.</ref>\n\nOne complication was the tidal flow in the [[English Channel]], where high water moves from west to east, with high water at [[Lyme Regis]] occurring around six hours before it reaches Dover. If all the landings were to be made at high water across a broad front, they would have to be made at different times along different parts of the coast, with the landings in Dover being made six hours after any landings in Dorset and thus losing the element of surprise. If the landings were to be made at the same time, methods would have to be devised to disembark men, vehicles and supplies at all states of the tide. That was another reason to favour landing craft.\n\n== German coastal guns ==\n{{Main|Cross-Channel guns in the Second World War}}\nWith Germany's occupation of the [[Pas-de-Calais]] region in [[Northern France]], the possibility of closing the [[Strait of Dover]] to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys by the use of land-based heavy artillery became readily apparent, both to the German High Command and to Hitler. Even the ''Kriegsmarine'''s Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal, especially given the relatively short distance, {{convert|34|km|abbr=on}}, between the French and English coasts. Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast, primarily at Pas-de-Calais. This work was assigned to the ''[[Organisation Todt]]'' and commenced on 22 July 1940.<ref name=Schenk323>Schenk, p.323</ref>\n[[File:210 mm Railway Gun.jpg|thumb|right|The huge [[21 cm K 12 (E)|21 cm K12 railway gun]] was only suitable for bombarding targets on land.]]\nBy early August, four {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} traversing turrets were fully operational as were all of the Army's railway guns. Seven of these weapons, six 28&nbsp;cm [[Krupp K5|K5 pieces]] and a single {{convert|21|cm|abbr=on}} [[21 cm K 12 (E)|K12 gun]] with a range of {{convert|115|km|abbr=on}}, could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28&nbsp;cm and five {{convert|24|cm|abbr=on}} pieces, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24&nbsp;cm guns and ten 21&nbsp;cm weapons, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long loading time and ammunition types.<ref name=Schenk324>Schenk, p.324</ref>\n\nBetter suited for use against naval targets were the four heavy naval batteries installed by mid-September: ''Friedrich August'' with three [[30.5 cm SK L/50 gun|{{convert|30.5|cm|abbr=on}} barrels]]; ''Prinz Heinrich'' with two [[28 cm SK L/40 gun|28&nbsp;cm guns]]; ''[[Battery Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]'' with two 24&nbsp;cm weapons and, largest of all, ''Siegfried'' (later renamed ''Batterie Todt'') with a pair of [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|{{convert|38|cm|abbr=on}} guns]]. Fire control for these weapons was provided by both spotter aircraft and by DeTeGer\u00e4t radar sets installed at [[Blanc Nez]] and Cap d\u2019Alprech. These units were capable of detecting targets out to a range of {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}, including small British patrol craft inshore of the English coast. Two additional radar sites were added by mid-September: a DeTeGer\u00e4t at Cap de la Hague and a FernDeTeGer\u00e4t long-range radar at Cap d\u2019Antifer near Le Havre.<ref name=Schenk324-325>Schenk, pp.324\u2013325</ref>\n\nTo strengthen German control of the Channel narrows, the Army planned to quickly establish mobile artillery batteries along the English shoreline once a beachhead had been firmly established. Towards that end, 16th Army's ''Artillerie Kommand 106'' was slated to land with the second wave to provide fire protection for the transport fleet as early as possible. This unit consisted of twenty-four {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on}} and seventy-two {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}} guns. About one third of them were to be deployed on English soil by the end of Sea Lion's first week.<ref name=Schenk325-327>Schenk, pp.325\u2013327</ref>\n\nThe presence of these batteries was expected to greatly reduce the threat posed by British destroyers and smaller craft along the eastern approaches as the guns would be sited to cover the main transport routes from Dover to Calais and [[Hastings]] to Boulogne. They could not entirely protect the western approaches, but a large area of those invasion zones would still be within effective range.<ref name=Schenk325-327 />\n\nThe British military was well aware of the dangers posed by German artillery dominating the Dover Strait and on 4 September 1940 the Chief of Naval Staff issued a memo stating that if the Germans \"\u2026could get possession of the Dover defile and capture its gun defences from us, then, holding these points on both sides of the Straits, they would be in a position largely to deny those waters to our naval forces\". Should the Dover defile be lost, he concluded, the Royal Navy could do little to interrupt the flow of German supplies and reinforcements across the Channel, at least by day, and he further warned that \"\u2026there might really be a chance that they (the Germans) might be able to bring a serious weight of attack to bear on this country\". The very next day the Chiefs of Staff, after discussing the importance of the defile, decided to reinforce the Dover coast with more ground troops.<ref name=Cox149-150>Cox, pp.149\u2013150</ref>\n\nThe guns started to fire in the second week of August 1940 and were not silenced until 1944, when the batteries were overrun by Allied ground forces. They caused 3,059 alerts, 216 civilian deaths, and damage to 10,056 premises in the Dover area. However, despite firing on frequent slow moving coastal convoys, often in broad daylight, for almost the whole of that period (there was an interlude in 1943), there is no record of any vessel being hit by them, although one seaman was killed and others were injured by shell splinters from near misses.<ref>Hewitt, Nick p. 109</ref> Whatever the perceived risk, this lack of ability to hit any moving ship does not support the contention that the German coastal batteries would have been a serious threat to fast destroyers or smaller warships.<ref>Hewitt, Geoff p. 41</ref>\n\n== Indefinite postponement ==\nDuring the summer of 1940, both the British public and the Americans believed that a German invasion was imminent, and they studied the forthcoming [[high tide]]s of 5\u20139 August, 2\u20137 September, 1\u20136 October, and 30 October \u2013 4 November as likely dates.<ref name=\"sptimes19400803\">{{cite news\n| url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XE0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5186%2C219407\n| title      = Next Week May See Nazis Attempt British Invasion\n| work       = St. Petersburg Times\n| date       = 3 August 1940\n| accessdate = 26 November 2011\n| page       = 1\n}}</ref> The British [[British anti-invasion preparations of the Second World War|prepared extensive defences]], and, in Churchill's view, \"the great invasion scare\" was \"serving a most useful purpose\" by \"keeping every man and woman tuned to a high pitch of readiness\".{{sfn|Bishop|2010|pp=70\u201371}}<ref>John Colville, ''The Fringes of Power'' (1986), diary notes on Churchill's 11 July meetings; in {{cite book\n| author    = Michael I.

On 10 July, he advised the War Cabinet that the possibility of invasion could be ignored, as it \"would be a most hazardous and suicidal operation\"; and on 13 August that \"now that we were so much stronger\", he thought \"we could spare an armoured brigade from this country\". Over-riding [[John Dill|General Dill]], Churchill initiated [[Operation Compass|Operation Apology]] by which a series of troop convoys, including three tank regiments and eventually the entire 2nd Armoured Division, were sent around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to reinforce [[Archibald Wavell|General Wavell]] in the Middle East in support of operations against [[Italy|Italian]] colonial forces (Italy had declared war on 10 June).{{sfn|Deighton|1996|p=51}} Furthermore, on Churchill's urging, on 5 August the War Cabinet approved [[Operation Menace]], in which a substantial proportion of the Home Fleet - two battleships, an aircraft carrier, five cruisers, and twelve destroyers, together with five out of six battalions of [[Royal Marines]], were dispatched to [[Dakar]] on 30 August in an attempt to neutralise the battleship [[French battleship Richelieu|Richelieu]] and detach [[French West Africa]] from [[Vichy France]] to the control of the [[Free French]].  Overall, these actions in the summer of 1940 demonstrated Churchill's confidence in August 1940; that the immediate danger of a German invasion was now over, that the Home Forces were fully adequate to defend Great Britain if the Germans did come, and that the interests of the British Empire were, for the present, better served by attacking the colonial forces of Germany's allies, rather than by confronting the German Army directly.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|pp=196-199}}\n\nThe Germans were confident enough to film a simulation of the intended invasion in advance. A crew turned up at the Belgian port of [[Antwerp]] in early September 1940 and, for two days, they filmed tanks and troops landing from barges on a nearby beach under simulated fire. It was explained that, as the invasion would happen at night, Hitler wanted the German people to see all the details.<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey. Military Anecdotes (1992) p. 210, Guinness Publishing {{ISBN|0-85112-519-0}}</ref>\n\nIn early August, the German command had agreed that the invasion should begin on 15 September, but the Navy's revisions to its schedule set the date back to 20 September. At a conference on 14 September, Hitler praised the various preparations, but told his service chiefs that, as air superiority had still not been achieved, he would review whether to proceed with the invasion. At this conference, he gave the Luftwaffe the opportunity to act independently of the other services, with intensified continuous air attacks to overcome British resistance; on 16 September, G\u00f6ring issued orders for this new phase of the air attack.{{sfn|Overy|2010|pp=87\u201388}} On 17 September 1940, Hitler held a meeting with ''Reichsmarschall'' Hermann G\u00f6ring and ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] during which he became convinced the operation was not viable. Control of the skies was still lacking, and co-ordination among three branches of the armed forces was out of the question. Later that day, Hitler ordered the postponement of the operation. He ordered the dispersal of the invasion fleet in order to avert further damage by British air and naval attacks.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Wright\n| first     = Gordon\n| title     = The Ordeal of Total War: 1939\u20131945\n| url      = https://archive.org/details/ordealoftotalwar00wrig\n| url-access = registration\n| location  = New York\n| publisher = Harper & Row\n| year      = 1968\n| page      = [https://archive.org/details/ordealoftotalwar00wrig/page/32 32]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe postponement coincided with rumours that there had been an attempt to land on British shores on or about 7 September, which had been repulsed with large German casualties. The story was later expanded to include false reports that the British had set the sea on fire using flaming oil. Both versions were widely reported in the American press and in [[William L. Shirer]]'s ''[[Berlin Diary]]'', but both were officially denied by Britain and Germany.

The great majority of military historians, including [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]], [[Derek Robinson (novelist)|Derek Robinson]] and [[Stephen Bungay]], have expressed the opinion that it had little chance of success and would have most likely resulted in a disaster for the Germans. [[Len Deighton]] and some other writers have called the German amphibious plans a \"[[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]] in reverse\".<ref>[[Len Deighton|Deighton, Len]] (1980) ''Battle of Britain'' London: Jonathan Cape, {{page needed|date=December 2017}}</ref> Robinson argues the massive superiority of the Royal Navy over the ''Kriegsmarine'' would have made Sea Lion a disaster. [[Andrew Gordon (naval historian)|Dr Andrew Gordon]], in an article for the ''[[Royal United Services Institute Journal]]''<ref>[https://rusi.org/commentary/battle-britain-naval-perspective ''RUSI Journal''], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228054046/https://rusi.org/commentary/battle-britain-naval-perspective |date=28 December 2017 }} (retrieved 27 December 2017)</ref> agrees with this and is clear in his conclusion the German Navy was never in a position to mount Sealion, regardless of any realistic outcome of the Battle of Britain. In his fictional [[alternate history]] ''Invasion: the German invasion of England, July 1940'', [[Kenneth Macksey]] proposes that the Germans might have succeeded if they had swiftly and decisively begun preparations even before the Dunkirk evacuations, and the Royal Navy for some reason had held back from large-scale intervention,<ref>Macksey 1990, pp. 144\u2013146.</ref> though in practice the Germans were unprepared for such a speedy commencement of their assault.<ref>Macksey 1990, pp. 209\u2013210</ref>\n\nAn alternative perspective was advanced in 2016 by [[Robert Forczyk]] in ''We march against England''. Forczyk claims to apply a much more realistic assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of both German and British forces, and challenges the views advanced by previous writers that the Royal Navy might easily have overwhelmed the German naval units protecting the first wave invasion fleet. His assessment concurs with that emerging from the 1974 [[Sandhurst Sea Lion wargame]] (see below) that the first wave would likely have crossed the Channel and established a lodgement around the landing beaches in Kent and East Sussex without major loss, and that the defending British forces would have been unlikely to have dislodged them once ashore. He proposes though, that the westernmost German landing at beach 'E' could not have been sustained for long against counterattacking British ground, naval and air forces, and that accordingly these German units would have had to fight their way eastwards, abandoning any aspiration to hold [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]. In the absence of access to a major port and with continued losses of German troop transport vessels from submarine attack, Forczyk argues that proposed arrangements for landing the second wave onto the beaches would have been wholly impractical once autumn and winter weather set into the Channel, so the first wave would be stranded in Kent as a 'beached whale' without substantial armour, transport or heavy artillery \u2014 unable to break out and threaten [[London]]. Nevertheless, Forczyk does not accept that they would have surrendered, pointing to the determined resistance of surrounded German forces at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and [[Demyansk Pocket|Demyansk]]. He suggests they could have held on into 1941, sustained by a small-ship fast night-time resupply operation into [[Folkestone Harbour|Folkestone]] (and maybe [[Port of Dover|Dover]]), holding the possibility of negotiating their withdrawal in Spring 1941 under a truce agreed with the British government.{{sfn|Forczyk|2016|pp=242-270}}\n\n=== Logistics ===\nFour years later, the Allied [[D-Day]] landings showed just how much materiel had to be landed continuously to maintain an amphibious invasion. The problem for the Germans was worse, as the German Army was mostly horse-drawn. One of its prime headaches would have been transporting thousands of horses across the Channel.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Deighton\n| first     = Len\n| title     = [[Blood, Tears & Folly]]\n| publisher = Jonathan Cape, London\n| year      = 1993\n| isbn      = 0-224-03135-X\n}}</ref> British intelligence calculated that the first wave of 10 divisions (including the airborne division) would require a daily average of 3,300 tons of supplies.<ref>Fleming, p.237</ref> In fact, in Russia in 1941, when engaged in heavy fighting (at the end of a very long supply line), a single German infantry division required up to 1,100 tons of supplies a day,<ref>{{cite book\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=b3W1tiuHzcoC&pg=PA298\n| title      = Handbook on German military forces \u2013 Google Books\n| date       = \n| accessdate = 8 April 2013\n| isbn = 9780807140710\n}}</ref> though a more usual figure would be 212-425 tons per day.<ref>Handbook on German military forces \u2013 Google Books p.VI-17 \u2013 VI-18</ref> The smaller figure is more likely due to the very short distances the supplies would have to travel. Rations for two weeks were to be provided to the German troops of the first wave because the armies had been instructed to live off the land as far as possible in order to minimise supply across the Channel during the initial phase of the battle.<ref name=Kieser226>Kieser, pp. 226</ref> British intelligence further calculated that Folkestone, the largest harbour falling within the planned German landing zones, could handle 150 tons per day in the first week of the invasion (assuming all dockside equipment was successfully demolished and regular RAF bombing raids reduced capacity by 50%). Within seven days, maximum capacity was expected to rise to 600 tons per day, once German shore parties had made repairs to the quays and cleared the harbour of any blockships and other obstacles. This meant that, at best, the nine German infantry and one airborne division landed in the first wave would receive less than 20% of the 3,300 tons of supplies they required each day through a port, and would have to rely heavily on whatever could be brought in directly over the beaches or air-lifted into captured airstrips.<ref name=Fleming257-58>Fleming, pp. 257\u2013258</ref>\n\nThe successful capture of [[Dover]] and its [[Port of Dover|harbour facilities]] might have been expected to add another 800 tons per day, raising to 40% the amount of supplies brought in through ports. However, this rested on the rather unrealistic assumption of little or no interference from the Royal Navy and RAF with the German supply convoys which would have been made up of underpowered (or unpowered, i.e. towed) inland waterways vessels as they shuttled slowly between the Continent to the invasion beaches and any captured harbours.<ref name=\"Fleming257-58\" />\n\n=== Weather ===\nFrom 19 to 26 September 1940, sea and wind conditions on and over the [[English Channel|Channel]] where the invasion was to take place were good overall, and a crossing, even using converted river barges, was feasible provided the [[sea state]] remained at less than 4, which for the most part it did. Winds for the remainder of the month were rated as \"moderate\" and would not have prevented the German invasion fleet from successfully depositing the first wave troops ashore during the ten days needed to accomplish this.<ref name=Fleming259>Fleming, p. 259</ref> From the night of 27 September, strong northerly winds prevailed, making passage more hazardous, but calm conditions returned on 11\u201312 October and again on 16\u201320 October. After that, light easterly winds prevailed which would have assisted any invasion craft travelling from the Continent towards the invasion beaches. But by the end of October, according to British Air Ministry records, very strong south-west winds (force 8) would have prohibited any non-seagoing craft from risking a Channel crossing.<ref name=Cox187>Cox, p. 187</ref>\n\n=== German intelligence ===\nAt least 20 spies were sent to England by boat or parachute to gather information on the British coastal defences under the codename \"Operation Lena\"; many of the agents spoke limited English. All agents were quickly captured and many were convinced to defect by [[MI5]]'s [[Double-Cross System]], providing disinformation to their German superiors. It has been suggested that the \"amateurish\" espionage efforts were a result of deliberate sabotage by the head of the army intelligence bureau in Hamburg, [[Herbert Wichmann]], in an effort to prevent a disastrous and costly amphibious invasion; Wichmann was critical of the Nazi regime and had close ties to [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the former head of the ''Abwehr'' who was later executed by the Nazis for treason.<ref>{{cite news\n| last        = Frenzel\n| first       = Eike\n| date        = 21 August 2014\n| title       = Hitlers Unternehmen \"Seel\u00f6we\": Invasion der Amateure\n| trans-title = Hitler's Operation \"Sea Lion\": Invasion of Amateurs\n| url         = http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/hitlers-unternehmen-seeloewe-die-invasion-die-nie-stattfand-a-986303.html\n| language    = de\n| journal     = [[Der Spiegel]]\n| location    = Hamburg\n| publisher   = Spiegel-Verlag\n| accessdate  = 21 August 2014\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821203750/http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/hitlers-unternehmen-seeloewe-die-invasion-die-nie-stattfand-a-986303.html\n| archivedate = 21 August 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile some errors might not have caused problems, others, such as the inclusion of bridges that no longer existed<ref name=Wheeler-10>German Invasion Plans for the British Isles, Ed Rob Wheeler, [[Bodleian Library]] 2007, p. 10</ref> and misunderstanding the usefulness of minor British roads,<ref name=Wheeler-10 /> would have been detrimental to German operations, and would have added to the confusion caused by the layout of Britain's cities (with their maze of narrow roads and alleys){{clarify|date=May 2016}} and the removal of road signs.<ref>Wheeler, text of plate 7</ref>\n\n=== Post-war wargaming of the plan ===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Lion (wargame)}}\nA [[Operation Sea Lion (wargame)|1974 wargame]] was conducted at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/seelowe.txt\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 1 June 2006\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613114509/http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/seelowe.txt\n| archivedate = 13 June 2008\n}}</ref>  The controllers of the game assumed that the {{lang|de|Luftwaffe}} had not diverted its daytime operations into bombing London on 7 September 1940, but had continued its assault against RAF airbases in the South East. Consequently, the German High Command, relying on grossly overstated claims of RAF fighters shot down, were under the erroneous impression that by 19 September RAF front-line fighter strength had fallen to 140 (as against a true figure of over 700); and hence that effective German air superiority might shortly be achieved.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_JIBYcrqYoOdEVBS0dOWldlQ00/view|title = The Invaders reach Berkshire: Article from Daily Telegraph| accessdate  = 26 April 2019}}</ref> In the Game, the Germans were able to land almost all their first echelon forces on 22 September 1940, and established a beachhead in south-east England, capturing Folkestone, and [[Port of Newhaven|Newhaven]], albeit that the British had demolished the facilities of both ports.  The British army forces, delayed in moving units from East Anglia to the South East by bomb damage to the rail network south of London, were nevertheless able to hold onto positions in and around [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]] and [[Dover]], sufficient to deny their use by German forces. Both the RAF and the Luftwaffe lost nearly a quarter of their available forces on the first day, after which it finally became apparent to the German command that British airpower was not, after all, on the point of collapse. On the second day a Royal Navy force of [[cruisers]] and [[destroyers]] was able to reach the [[English Channel|Channel]] from [[Rosyth]], in time to intercept and destroy most of the barges carrying the second and third echelon of German amphibious landings (for the game, these follow-up echelons had been held back from crossing the Channel on S minus one with the first echelon, instead sailing across on the night of S plus one). Without the second and third echelons, the forces ashore were cut off from reserves of artillery, vehicles, fuel and ammunition supplies; and blocked from further reinforcements. Isolated and facing fresh regular troops with armour and artillery, the invasion force was forced to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] after six days.<ref>The Sandhurst wargame was fictionalised in Richard Cox (ed.), ''Operation Sea Lion'' (London: Thornton Cox, 1974. {{ISBN|0-902726-17-X}}).

That became something that you couldn't do even retroactively after 9/11.\" Other motifs included romance, depicted in the 1988 film ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'', and corporate avarice, depicted in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite news |last=Poulou |first=Penelope |title=New York's Twin Towers Appear in Many Hollywood Films |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |website=VOANews.com |date=August 29, 2011|access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164507/https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Comic books, animated cartoons, television shows, video games, and music videos also used the complex as a setting.{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}}\n\n==== After the September 11 attacks ====\n{{see also|List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks|List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks}}\nAfter the September 11 attacks, some movies and TV shows [[Cultural influence of the September 11 attacks|deleted scenes or episodes]] set within the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/movies/9-11-twin-towers-tv-movies.html|title=After Sept. 11, Twin Towers Onscreen Are a Tribute and a Painful Reminder|last=Mashberg|first=Tom|date=September 10, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 13, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"EW.com 2013\">{{cite news |last=Bahr |first=Lindsay |title=Television's uneasy relationship with the World Trade Center |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 21, 2013|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226153248/http://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/|archive-date=February 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lemire |first=Christy |title=Twin towers erased from some films after 9/11 |url=http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/ |publisher=[[NBC News]] |website=Today.com |date=September 13, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018 |language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109133908/http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/|archive-date=November 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Dixon|2004|p=4}} For example, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\", which first aired in 1997, was removed from syndication after the attacks because a scene showed the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='Simpsons' exec producer Al Jean: 'I completely understand' if reruns with nuclear jokes are pulled |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 27, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708205626/http://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/|archive-date=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Songs that mentioned the World Trade Center were no longer aired on radio, and the release dates of some films, such as the 2001\u20132002 films ''[[Sidewalks of New York (2001 film)|Sidewalks of New York]], [[People I Know]],'' and [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']], were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}} The 2001 film ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'', which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] the day before the attacks, had to be modified before its general public release, so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />\n\nOther episodes and films mentioned the attacks directly, or depicted the World Trade Center in alternate contexts.<ref name=\"EW.com 2013\" /> The production of some family-oriented films was also sped up due to a large demand for that genre following the attacks.

That became something that you couldn't do even retroactively after 9/11.\" Other motifs included romance, depicted in the 1988 film ''[[Working Girl (film)|Working Girl]]'', and corporate avarice, depicted in ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1987).<ref>{{cite news |last=Poulou |first=Penelope |title=New York's Twin Towers Appear in Many Hollywood Films |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |website=VOANews.com |date=August 29, 2011|access-date=February 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164507/https://www.voanews.com/a/new-yorks-twin-towers-appear-in-many-hollywood-films-128592413/165032.html|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Comic books, animated cartoons, television shows, video games, and music videos also used the complex as a setting.{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}}\n\n==== After the September 11 attacks ====\n{{see also|List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks|List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks}}\nAfter the September 11 attacks, some movies and TV shows [[Cultural influence of the September 11 attacks|deleted scenes or episodes]] set within the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/movies/9-11-twin-towers-tv-movies.html|title=After Sept. 11, Twin Towers Onscreen Are a Tribute and a Painful Reminder|last=Mashberg|first=Tom|date=September 10, 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 13, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"EW.com 2013\">{{cite news |last=Bahr |first=Lindsay |title=Television's uneasy relationship with the World Trade Center |url=https://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/ |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=January 21, 2013|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226153248/http://ew.com/article/2013/01/21/televisions-uneasy-relationship-with-the-world-trade-center/|archive-date=February 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lemire |first=Christy |title=Twin towers erased from some films after 9/11 |url=http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/ |publisher=[[NBC News]] |website=Today.com |date=September 13, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018 |language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181109133908/http://www.today.com/id/44206574/ns/today-today_entertainment/t/twin-towers-erased-some-films-after/|archive-date=November 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{sfnp|Dixon|2004|p=4}} For example, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson]]\", which first aired in 1997, was removed from syndication after the attacks because a scene showed the World Trade Center.<ref>{{cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='Simpsons' exec producer Al Jean: 'I completely understand' if reruns with nuclear jokes are pulled |url=https://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/ |magazine=Entertainment Weekly |date=March 27, 2011|access-date=November 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708205626/http://ew.com/article/2011/03/27/simpsons-al-jean-nuclear-japan/|archive-date=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Songs that mentioned the World Trade Center were no longer aired on radio, and the release dates of some films, such as the 2001\u20132002 films ''[[Sidewalks of New York (2001 film)|Sidewalks of New York]], [[People I Know]],'' and [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|''Spider-Man'']], were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />{{sfnp|Langmead|2009|p=354}} The 2001 film ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]'', which was shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] the day before the attacks, had to be modified before its general public release, so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the World Trade Center.<ref name=\"Mashberg 2019\" />\n\nOther episodes and films mentioned the attacks directly, or depicted the World Trade Center in alternate contexts.<ref name=\"EW.com 2013\" /> The production of some family-oriented films was also sped up due to a large demand for that genre following the attacks.

It covered a huge area that included territories in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]].\nIt originated in 1521 after the [[fall of Tenochtitlan]], the main event of the Spanish conquest, which did not properly end until much later, as its territory continued to grow to the north. It was officially created on 18 August 1521 as a [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] (Spanish: ''reino''), the first of [[Viceroyalty#Spain|four viceroyalties Spain created in the Americas]]. Its first [[viceroy]] was [[Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco]], and the capital of the kingdom was [[Mexico City]], established on the ancient [[Tenochtitlan]].\n\nIt included what is now [[Mexico]] plus the current U.S. states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Florida]] and parts of [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]; as well as the southwestern part of [[British Columbia]] of present-day [[Canada]]; plus the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] (which included the current countries of [[Guatemala]], the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]]); the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] (current [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]); and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] (including the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the [[Caroline Islands]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and the short lived [[Spanish Formosa]] in modern-day northern [[Taiwan]], as well as during a century the island of [[Tidore]] and the briefly occupied [[Sultanate of Ternate]], both in modern-day [[Indonesia]]).\n\nOther kingdoms of the Spanish Empire bordered New Spain and were given the right of appeal to the most senior representative of the [[King of Spain|king]]. These kingdoms were independent of New Spain (separate from New Spain itself): [[Nueva Galicia]] (1530); [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] (1540); [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] (1562); [[New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] (1569); [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] (1598); [[Nueva Extremadura]] (1674) and [[Nuevo Santander]] (1746).\n\nNew Spain proper was itself organized in [[Captaincy general|captaincies general]]. There were four captaincies: Captaincy General of the Philippines (1574), Captaincy General of Cuba, [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico]] and [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]. These independent kingdoms and territorial subdivisions each had their own governor and captain generals (who in New Spain was the viceroy himself, who added this title to his other dignities). In Guatemala, Santo Domingo and Nueva Galicia, these officials were called presiding governors, since they were leading royal audiences. For this reason, these hearings were considered \"praetorial.\"\n\nThere were two great estates in America. The most important was the [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marquisate of the Valley]] of [[Oaxaca]], property of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his descendants that included a set of vast territories where marquises had civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the right to grant land, water and forests and within which were their main possessions (cattle ranches, agricultural work, sugar mills, fulling houses and shipyards). The other estate was the Duchy of [[Atlixco]], granted in 1708, by [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]] to [[Jos\u00e9 Sarmiento de Valladares, 1st Duke of Atrisco|Jos\u00e9 Sarmiento de Valladares]], former viceroy of New Spain and married to the Countess of Moctezuma, with civil and criminal jurisdiction over Atlixco, [[Tepeaca]], [[Guachinango, Jalisco|Guachinango]], Ixtepeji and Tula de Allende. Another important Marquisate was the [[Sebastian Elcano|Marquisate of Buglas]] in Negros Island at the Philippines which was awarded to the descendants of Sebastian Elcano and his crew, the first to circumnavigate the world. [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] introduced reforms in the organization of the viceroyalty in 1786, known as [[Bourbon reforms]], which created the [[intendent|intendencias]], which allowed to limit, in some way, the viceroy's attributions.\n\nNew Spain developed highly regional divisions, reflecting the impact of climate, topography, indigenous populations, and mineral resources. The areas of central and southern Mexico had dense indigenous populations with complex social, political, and economic organization. The northern area of Mexico, a region of nomadic and semi-nomadic indigenous populations, was not generally conducive to dense settlements, but the discovery of [[silver]] in [[Zacatecas]] in the 1540s drew settlement there to exploit the mines. Silver mining not only became the engine of the economy of New Spain, but vastly enriched Spain and transformed the global economy. New Spain was the New World terminus of the Philippine trade, making the kingdom a vital link between Spain's New World empire and [[Spanish East Indies|its Asian empire]].\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, the kingdom fell into crisis, aggravated by the [[Peninsular War]], and its direct consequence in the kingdom, the political crisis in Mexico in 1808, which ended with the government of Viceroy [[Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray]] and, later, gave rise to the Conspiracy of Valladolid and the Conspiracy of Quer\u00e9taro. This last one was the direct antecedent of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], which, when concluding in 1821, disintegrated the viceroyalty and gave way to the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], in which finally [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] would be crowned.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Viceroyalty of New Spain and its relationship to the crown==\nThe [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was established following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in 1521 as a New World kingdom dependent on the [[Crown of Castile]], since the initial funds for exploration came from [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{harvp|Haring|1947|pp=7, 105}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Liss|1975|p=33}}</ref> Although New Spain was a dependency of Castile, it was a kingdom not a colony, subject to the presiding monarch on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Haring_7\">{{harvp|Haring|1947|p=7}}</ref><ref>Mark A.

To the east of the continent, it included the [[Spanish West Indies]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (comprising the modern states of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Trinidad]], and the [[Bay Islands (department)|Bay Islands]]).\n\n[[File:Spanish North America.png|thumb|Spanish historical presence, claimed territories, points of interest and expeditions in North America.]]\n\nUntil the 18th century, when Spain saw its claims in North America threatened by other European powers, much of what were called the Spanish borderlands consisted of territory now part of the United States. This was not occupied by many Spanish settlers and was considered more marginal to Spanish interests than the most densely populated and lucrative areas of central Mexico. To shore up its claims in North America, starting in the late 18th century [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] explored and claimed the coast of what is now British Columbia and Alaska. On the mainland, the administrative units included [[Las Californias]], that is, the Baja California peninsula, still part of Mexico and divided into [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]; [[Alta California]] (present-day [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]], and southern [[Wyoming]]); (from the 1760s) [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] (including the western Mississippi River basin and the Missouri River basin); [[Nueva Extremadura]] (the present-day states of [[Coahuila]] and [[Texas]]); and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] (parts of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/412085/Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain |title=Viceroyalty of New Spain (historical territory, Mexico) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Conquest era (1521\u20131535)===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|History of Mexico City}}\nThe Caribbean islands and early Spanish explorations around the circum-Caribbean region had not been of major political, strategic, or financial importance until the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] in 1521. However, important precedents of exploration, conquest, and settlement and crown rule had been initially worked out in the Caribbean, which long affected subsequent regions, including Mexico and Peru.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=61\u201385}}</ref> The indigenous societies of [[Mesoamerica]] brought under Spanish control were of unprecedented complexity and wealth from what they had encountered in the Caribbean. This presented both an important opportunity and a potential threat to the power of the [[Crown of Castile]], since the conquerors were acting independent of effective crown control. The societies could provide the [[conquistador]]s, especially [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], a base from which the conquerors could become autonomous, or even independent, of the Crown.\n\nAs a result, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King of Spain, Charles V]] created the [[Council of the Indies]]{{#tag:ref|The Spanish called their overseas empire \"the Indies\" until the end of its empire, a remnant of Columbus's assertion that he had reached the Far East, rather than a New World.|group=Note}} in 1524 as the crown entity to oversee the crown's interests in the New World. Since the time of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], central Iberia was governed through councils appointed by the monarch with particular jurisdictions. Thus, the creation of the Council of the Indies became another, but extremely important, advisory body to the monarch.\n\nThe crown had set up the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]] (House of Trade) in 1503 to regulate contacts between Spain and its overseas possessions. A key function was to gather information about navigation to make trips less risky and more efficient. Philip II sought systematic information about his overseas empire and mandated reports, known as the [[Relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]], with text on topography, economic conditions, and populations among other information. They were accompanied by maps of the area discussed, many of which were drawn by indigenous artists.<ref>Howard F.

An earlier [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Audiencia]] had been established in [[Santo Domingo]] in 1526 to deal with the Caribbean settlements. That court, housed in the [[Museo de las Casas Reales|Casa Reales]] in Santo Domingo, was charged with encouraging further exploration and settlements with the authority granted it by the crown. Management by the Audiencia, which was expected to make executive decisions as a body, proved unwieldy. Therefore, in 1535, King Charles V named Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] as the first [[Viceroy of New Spain]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1532 opened up the vast territories of [[South America]] to further conquests, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Crown]] established an independent [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] there in 1542.\n\n===Evangelization===\n{{Main|History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico}}\nBecause the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had played such an important role in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Christian reconquest) of the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the [[Moors]], the Church in essence became another arm of the Spanish government. The Spanish Crown granted it a large role in the administration of the state, and this practice became even more pronounced in the New World, where prelates often assumed the role of government officials. In addition to the Church's explicit political role, the Catholic faith became a central part of Spanish identity after the conquest of last Muslim kingdom in the peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada]], and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of all Jews]] who did not convert to Christianity.\n\nThe [[conquistador]]s brought with them many missionaries to promulgate the Catholic religion. Amerindians were taught the Roman Catholic religion and the language of Spain. Initially, the missionaries hoped to create a large body of Amerindian priests, but this did not come to be. Moreover, efforts were made to keep the Amerindian cultural aspects that did not violate the Catholic traditions. As an example, most Spanish priests committed themselves to learn the most important Amerindian languages (especially during the 16th century) and wrote grammars so that the missionaries could learn the languages and preach in them. This was similarly practiced by the French colonists.\n\nAt first, conversion seemed to be happening rapidly. The missionaries soon found that most of the natives had simply adopted \"the god of the heavens,\" as they called the Christian god,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} as just another one of their many gods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} While they often held the Christian god to be an important deity because it was the god of the victorious conquerors, they did not see the need to abandon their old beliefs. As a result, a second wave of missionaries began an effort to completely erase the old beliefs, which they associated with the ritualized [[human sacrifice]] found in many of the native religions, eventually putting an end to this practice common before the arrival of the Spaniards. In the process many artifacts of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of native [[codex|codices]] were burned, native priests and teachers were persecuted, and the temples and statues of the old gods were torn down. Even some foods associated with the native religions, like [[amaranth]], were forbidden.\n\nMany clerics, such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]], also tried to protect the natives from ''de facto'' and actual enslavement to the settlers, and obtained from the Crown decrees and promises to protect native Mesoamericans, most notably the [[New Laws]]. Unfortunately, the royal government was too far away to fully enforce them, and many abuses against the natives, even among the clergy, continued. Eventually, the Crown declared the natives to be [[Ward (law)|legal minors]] and placed under the guardianship of the Crown, which was responsible for their indoctrination. It was this status that barred the native population from the priesthood. During the following centuries, under Spanish rule, a new culture developed that combined the customs and traditions of the indigenous peoples with that of Catholic Spain. Numerous churches and other buildings were constructed by native labor in the Spanish style, and cities were named after various saints or religious topics such as [[San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed|San Luis Potos\u00ed]] (after [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]]) and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] (the [[True Cross]]).\n\nThe [[Spanish Inquisition]], and its New Spanish counterpart, the [[Mexican Inquisition]], continued to operate in the viceroyalty until Mexico declared its independence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Inquisition worked with the viceregal government to block the diffusion of [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as well as the revolutionary republican and democratic ideas of the [[United States War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]].\n\n===Founding Spanish cities, early sixteenth century===\n{{main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ruscelli Nueva Hispania Tabula Nova 1561 UTA.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Ruscelli's 1561 map of New Spain, ''Nueva Hispania Tabula Nova'']]\n\nEven before the establishment of the viceroyalty of New Spain, conquerors in central Mexico founded new Spanish cities and embarked on further conquests, a pattern that had been established in the Caribbean.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=61\u201371}}</ref> In central Mexico, the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] was transformed into the main settlement of the territory; thus, the [[history of Mexico City]] is of huge importance to the whole colonial enterprise. Spaniards founded new settlements in [[Puebla de los Angeles]] (founded 1531) at the midway point between the Mexico City (founded 1521\u201324) and the Caribbean port of [[Veracruz]] (1519). Colima (1524), [[Oaxaca City|Antequera]] (1526, now Oaxaca City), and [[Guadalajara]] (1532) were all new Spanish settlements. North of Mexico City, the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] was founded (ca. 1531) in what was called the [[Baj\u00edo]], a major zone of commercial agriculture. Guadalajara was founded northwest of Mexico City (1531\u201342) and became the dominant Spanish settlement in the region. West of Mexico City the settlement of Valladolid (Michoacan) was founded (1529\u201341). In the densely indigenous South, as noted, Antequera (1526) became the center of Spanish settlement in Oaxaca; [[Santiago de Guatemala]] was founded in 1524; and in Yucat\u00e1n, [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] (1542) was founded inland, with [[Campeche]] founded as a small, Caribbean port in 1541. There was sea trade between Campeche and Veracruz.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|loc=p. 86, map. 4}}</ref> During the first twenty years, before the establishment of the viceroyalty, some of the important cities of the colonial era that remain important today were founded. The discovery of silver in Zacatecas in the far north was a transformative event. The settlement of [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] was founded in 1547 deep in the territory of the nomadic and fierce [[Chichimeca]], whose resistance to Spanish presence was the protracted conflict of the [[Chichimeca War]].<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=86\u201392}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|pp=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\n===Later expansion===\n{{See also|Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions in Arizona|Spanish missions in Texas|Spanish missions in New Mexico|Presidio#Mexico}}\n[[File:Coronado-Remington.jpg|thumb|\"V\u00e1zquez de Coronado Sets Out to the North\" (1540), by [[Frederic Remington]], oil on canvas, 1905]]\n\nDuring the 16th century, many Spanish cities were established in North and Central America. Spain attempted to establish missions in what is now the [[southern United States]] including [[Spanish missions in Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Spanish missions in the Carolinas|South Carolina]] between 1568 and 1587. These efforts were mainly successful in the region of present-day [[Florida]], where the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was founded in 1565, the oldest European city in the United States.\n\nUpon his arrival, Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza vigorously took to the duties entrusted to him by the King and encouraged the exploration of Spain's new mainland territories. He commissioned the expeditions of [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] into the present day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] in 1540\u20131542. The Viceroy commissioned [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] in the first Spanish exploration up the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1542\u20131543. Cabrillo sailed far up the coast, becoming the first European to see present day California, United States. The Viceroy also sent [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] to the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1542\u20131543. As these new territories became controlled, they were brought under the purview of the Viceroy of New Spain. Spanish settlers expanded to Nuevo Mexico, and the major settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was founded in 1610.\n\nThe establishment of religious missions and military presidios on the northern frontier became the nucleus of Spanish settlement and the founding of Spanish towns.\n\n===Expansion to the Philippine Islands and the Manila trade===\n\n{{Main|History of the Philippines}}\nSeeking to develop trade between the [[East Indies]] and the [[Americas]] across the Pacific Ocean, [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] established the first Spanish settlement in the Philippine Islands in 1565, which became the town of ''San Miguel'' (present-day [[Cebu City]]). [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] discovered an efficient sailing route from the Philippine Islands to Mexico which took advantage of the [[Kuroshio Current]]. In 1571, the city of [[Manila]] became the capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]], with trade soon beginning via the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleons]]. The Manila-Acapulco trade route shipped products such as silk, spices, silver, porcelain and gold to the Americas from Asia.<ref>William Schurz, ''The Manila Galleon''.

Later they were traded across [[Europe]].\n\n===Spanish ocean trade routes and defense===\n{{Main|Spanish treasure fleet|Manila galleon}}\nThe Spanish crown created a system of convoys of ships (called the ''flota'') to prevent attacks by European [[privateer]]s. Some isolated attacks on these shipments took place in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] by English and Dutch pirates and privateers. One such act of piracy was led by [[Francis Drake]] in 1586, and another by [[Thomas Cavendish]] in 1587. In one episode, the cities of [[Huatulco]] (Oaxaca) and [[Barra de Navidad]] in [[Jalisco]] Province of M\u00e9xico were sacked. However, these maritime routes, both across the Pacific and the Atlantic, were successful in the defensive and logistical role they played in the history of the [[Spanish Empire]]. For over three centuries the [[Spanish Navy]] escorted the galleon convoys that sailed around the world.\n\nDon [[Lope D\u00edez de Armend\u00e1riz]], born in Quito, Ecuador, was the first Viceroy of New Spain who was born in the '[[New World]]'. He formed the 'Navy of Barlovento' ''(Armada de Barlovento)'', based in Veracruz, to patrol coastal regions and protect the [[harbor]]s, port towns, and trade ships from [[piracy|pirates]] and [[privateers]].\n\n===Indigenous revolts===\n[[File:Xochipilla.jpg|thumb|Viceroy don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] and [[Tlaxcalan]] Indians battle with the Caxcanes in the [[Mixt\u00f3n war]], 1541\u201342 in Nueva Galicia.]]\n\nAfter the conquest of central Mexico, there were only two major Indian revolts challenging Spanish rule. In the [[Mixt\u00f3n war]] in 1541, the viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] led an army against an uprising by [[Caxcan]]es. In the 1680 [[Pueblo revolt]], Indians in 24 settlements in New Mexico expelled the Spanish, who left for Texas, an exile lasting a decade. The [[Chichimeca war]] lasted over fifty years, 1550\u20131606, between the Spanish and various indigenous groups of northern New Spain, particularly in silver mining regions and the transportation trunk lines.<ref>Philip Wayne Powell, ''Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550\u20131600''.

It was a multiethnic revolt sparked by religious issues in several communities.<ref>Victoria Reifler Bricker, ''The Indian Christ, the Indian King: The Historical Substrate of Maya Myth and Ritual''.

In New Spain these grants were modeled after the tribute and [[corvee]] labor that the [[Mexica]] rulers had demanded from native communities. This system came to signify the oppression and exploitation of natives, although its originators may not have set out with such intent. In short order the upper echelons of patrons and priests in the society lived off the work of the lower classes. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the indigenous peoples, Bishop [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] suggested bringing black slaves to replace them. Fray Bartolom\u00e9 later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.\n\nIn Peru, the other discovery that perpetuated the system of forced labor, the [[mit'a]], was the enormously rich single silver mine discovered at Potos\u00ed, but in New Spain, labor recruitment differed significantly. With the exception of silver mines worked in the Aztec period at [[Taxco]], southwest of Tenochtitlan, the Mexico's mining region was outside the area of dense indigenous settlement. Labor for the mines in the north of Mexico had a workforce of black slave labor and indigenous wage labor, not draft labor.<ref name=\"Altman_etal_172\">{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=172}}</ref> Indigenous who were drawn to the mining areas were from different regions of the center of Mexico, with a few from the north itself. With such diversity they did not have a common ethnic identity or language and rapidly assimilated to Hispanic culture. Although mining was difficult and dangerous, the wages were good, which is what drew the indigenous labor.<ref name=\"Altman_etal_172\"/>\n\nThe Viceroyalty of New Spain was the principal source of income for Spain in the eighteenth century, with the revival of mining under the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. Important mining centers like [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]] and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] had been established in the sixteenth century and suffered decline for a variety of reasons in the seventeenth century, but silver mining in Mexico out performed all other Spanish overseas territories in revenues for the royal coffers.\n\nThe fast red [[dye]] [[cochineal]] was an important export in areas such as central Mexico and Oaxaca in terms of revenues to the crown and stimulation of the internal market of New Spain. ''[[Chocolate|Cacao]]'' and [[indigo]] were also important exports for the New Spain, but was used through rather the vice royalties rather than contact with European countries due to piracy, and smuggling.<ref name=\"Foster_101_103\">{{harvp|Foster|2000|pp=101\u2013103}}</ref> The indigo industry in particular also helped to temporarily unite communities throughout the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]] due to the smuggling.<ref name=\"Foster_101_103\"/>\n\nThere were two major ports in New Spain, [[Veracruz]] the viceroyalty's principal port on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Acapulco]] on the Pacific, terminus of the [[Manila Galleon]]. In the Philippines [[Manila]] near the [[South China Sea]] was the main port. The ports were fundamental for overseas trade, stretching a trade route from Asia, through the [[Manila Galleon]] to the Spanish mainland.\n\nThese were ships that made voyages from the Philippines to Mexico, whose goods were then transported overland from Acapulco to Veracruz and later reshipped from Veracruz to [[C\u00e1diz]] in Spain. So then, the ships that set sail from Veracruz were generally loaded with merchandise from the East Indies originating from the commercial centers of the [[Philippines]], plus the [[precious metal]]s and natural resources of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of [[USD|US$]]1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in [[gold]] and silver received from New Spain.\n\nHowever, these resources did not translate into development for the [[Metropolis]] (mother country) due to Spanish Roman Catholic Monarchy's frequent preoccupation with European wars (enormous amounts of this wealth were spent hiring mercenaries to fight the [[Protestant Reformation]]), as well as the incessant decrease in overseas transportation caused by assaults from companies of British [[buccaneer]]s, Dutch [[Privateer|corsairs]] and [[piracy|pirates]] of various origin. These companies were initially financed by, at first, by the [[Amsterdam]] [[stock market]], the first in history and whose origin is owed precisely to the need for funds to finance pirate expeditions, as later by the London market. The above is what some authors call the \"historical process of the transfer of wealth from the south to the north.\"\n\n==The Bourbon reforms (1713\u20131806)==\n{{Main|Bourbon Reforms}}\n[[File:Portrait of Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, 1st Marquess of Sonora]], Visitador in New Spain, who initiated major reforms]]\n[[File:CarlosFranciscodeCroix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlos Francisco de Croix, 1st Marquess of Croix]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]] (1766\u20131771)]]\n[[File:AntonioMariadeBucareliyUrsua.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]]]]\n[[File:JuanVicentedeGuemesPachecoyPadilla.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]] (1789\u20131794)]]\n\nThe Bourbon monarchy embarked upon a far-reaching program to revitalize the economy of its territories, both on the peninsula and its overseas possessions. The crown sought to enhance its control and administrative efficiency, and to decrease the power and privilege of the Roman Catholic Church vis-a-vis the state.<ref>N.M. Farriss, ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759\u20131821: The Crisis of Ecclesiastical Privilege''.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1966.</ref>\n\nThe British capture and occupation of both Manila and Havana in 1762, during the global conflict of the [[Seven Years' War]], meant that the Spanish crown had to rethink its military strategy for defending its possessions. The Spanish crown had engaged with Britain for a number of years in low-intensity warfare, with ports and trade routes harassed by English privateers. The crown strengthened the defenses of [[Veracruz]] and [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], Jamaica, Cuba, and Florida, but the British sacked ports in the late seventeenth century. [[Santiago de Cuba]] (1662), [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] [[Spanish Florida]] (1665) and [[Campeche]] 1678 and so with the loss of Havana and Manila, Spain realized it needed to take significant steps. The Bourbons created a standing army in New Spain, beginning in 1764, and strengthened defensive infrastructure, such as forts.<ref>Christon Archer, ''The Army in Bourbon Mexico, 1760\u20131810''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1977.</ref><ref>Lyle N. McAlister, ''The ''Fuero Militar'' in New Spain, 1764\u20131800''. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1957.</ref>\n\nThe crown sought reliable information about New Spain and dispatched [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] as ''Visitador General'' (inspector general), who observed conditions needing reform, starting in 1765, in order to strengthen crown control over the kingdom.<ref>Susan Deans-Smith, \"Bourbon Reforms\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 153.</ref>\n\nAn important feature of the Bourbon Reforms was that they ended the significant amount of local control that was a characteristic of the bureaucracy under the Habsburgs, especially through the sale of offices. The Bourbons sought a return to the monarchical ideal of having those not directly connected with local elites as administrators, who in theory should be disinterested, staff the higher echelons of regional government. In practice this meant that there was a concerted effort to appoint mostly [[peninsulares]], usually military men with long records of service (as opposed to the Habsburg preference for prelates), who were willing to move around the global empire. The intendancies were one new office that could be staffed with peninsulares, but throughout the 18th century significant gains were made in the numbers of governors-captain generals, audiencia judges and bishops, in addition to other posts, who were Spanish-born.\n\nIn 1766, the crown appointed [[Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqu\u00e9s de Croix]] as viceroy of New Spain. One of his early tasks was to implement the crown's decision to expel the [[Jesuits]] from all its territories, accomplished in 1767. Since the Jesuits had significant power, owning large, well managed haciendas, educating New Spain's elite young men, and as a religious order resistant to crown control, the Jesuits were a major target for the assertion of crown control. Croix closed the religious autos-de-fe of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to public viewing, signaling a shift in the crown's attitude toward religion. Other significant accomplishments under Croix's administration was the founding of the College of Surgery in 1768, part of the crown's push to introduce institutional reforms that regulated professions. The crown was also interested in generating more income for its coffers and Croix instituted the royal lottery in 1769. Croix also initiated improvements in the capital and seat of the viceroyalty, increasing the size of its central park, the Alameda.\n\nAnother activist viceroy carrying out reforms was [[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa]], marqu\u00e9s de Valleheroso y conde de Jerena, who served from 1771 to 1779, and died in office. Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, now Minister of the Indies following his appointment as Visitor General of New Spain, briefed the newly appointed viceroy about reforms to be implemented. In 1776, a new northern territorial division was established, [[Provincias Internas|Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]] known as the ''Provincias Internas'' (Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North, {{lang-es|Comandancia y Capitan\u00eda General de las Provincias Internas}}). [[Teodoro de Croix]] (nephew of the former viceroy) was appointed the first Commander General of the Provincias Internas, independent of the Viceroy of New Spain, to provide better administration for the northern frontier provinces. They included [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Nuevo Santander]], [[Sonora y Sinaloa]], [[Las Californias]], [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (Coahuila and Texas), and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. Bucareli was opposed to G\u00e1lvez's plan to implement the new administrative organization of intendancies, which he believed would burden areas with sparse population with excessive costs for the new bureaucracy.<ref>Christon I. Archer, \"Antonio Mar\u00eda Bucareli y Urs\u00faa\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 164.</ref>\n\nThe new Bourbon kings did not split the Viceroyalty of New Spain into smaller administrative units as they did with the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], carving out the [[Viceroyalty of R\u00edo de la Plata]] and the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], but New Spain was reorganized administratively and elite American-born Spanish men were passed over for high office. The crown also established a standing military, with the aim of defending its overseas territories. \n \nThe Spanish Bourbons monarchs' prime innovation introduction of [[Intendant|intendancies]], an institution emulating that of Bourbon France. They were first introduced on a large scale in New Spain, by the Minister of the Indies [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], in the 1770s, who originally envisioned that they would replace the viceregal system (viceroyalty) altogether. With broad powers over tax collection and the public treasury and with a mandate to help foster economic growth over their districts, intendants encroached on the traditional powers of viceroys, governors and local officials, such as the [[corregidor]]es, which were phased out as intendancies were established. The Crown saw the intendants as a check on these other officers. Over time accommodations were made. For example, after a period of experimentation in which an independent intendant was assigned to Mexico City, the office was thereafter given to the same person who simultaneously held the post of viceroy. Nevertheless, the creation of scores of autonomous intendancies throughout the Viceroyalty, created a great deal of decentralization, and in the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], in particular, the intendancy laid the groundwork for the future independent nations of the 19th century. In 1780, Minister of the Indies [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] sent a royal dispatch to [[Teodoro de Croix]], Commandant General of the Internal Provinces of New Spain ''(Provincias Internas)'', asking all subjects to donate money to help the American Revolution. Millions of pesos were given.\n\nThe focus on the economy (and the revenues it provided to the royal coffers) was also extended to society at large. Economic associations were promoted, such as the [[Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de los Amigos del Pa\u00eds|Economic Society of Friends of the Country]]. Similar \"Friends of the Country\" economic societies were established throughout the Spanish world, including Cuba and Guatemala.<ref>{{harvp|Shafer|1958}}</ref>\n\nThe crown sent a series of scientific expeditions to its overseas possessions, including the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain]], led by [[Mart\u00edn de Sess\u00e9]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Moci\u00f1o]] (1787\u20131808).<ref>Daniela Bleichmar, ''Visible Empire: Botanical Expeditions and Visual Culture in the Hispanic Enlightenment''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012, pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\nThe Bourbon Reforms were not a unified or entirely coherent program, but a series of crown initiatives designed to revitalize the economies of its overseas possessions and make administration more efficient and firmly under control of the crown. Record keeping improved and records were more centralized. The bureaucracy was staffed with well-qualified men, most of them peninsular-born Spaniards. The preference for them meant that there was resentment from American-born elite men and their families, who were excluded from holding office. The creation of a military meant that some American Spaniards became officers in local militias, but the ranks were filled with poor, mixed-race men, who resented service and avoided it if possible.<ref>Ida Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, pp. 316\u201317.</ref>\n\n==18th-century military conflicts==\n{{See also|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\n[[File:Dragon de cuera.jpg|thumb|18th-century ''[[soldado de cuera]]'' in [[colonial Mexico]]]]\nThe first century that saw the Bourbons on the [[Spain|Spanish]] throne coincided with series of [[Second Hundred Years' War|global conflicts]] that pitted primarily France against Great Britain. Spain as an ally of Bourbon France was drawn into these conflicts. In fact part of the motivation for the Bourbon Reforms was the perceived need to prepare the empire administratively, economically and militarily for what was the next expected war. The [[Seven Years' War]] proved to be catalyst for most of the reforms in the overseas possessions, just like the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] had been for the reforms on the Peninsula.\n\nIn 1720, the [[Villasur expedition]] from [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Santa Fe]] met and attempted to parley with [[French colonization of the Americas|French]]- allied [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] in what is now [[Nebraska]]. Negotiations were unsuccessful, and a battle ensued; the Spanish were badly defeated, with only thirteen managing to return to New Mexico. Although this was a small engagement, it is significant in that it was the deepest penetration of the Spanish into the [[Great Plains]], establishing the limit to Spanish expansion and influence there.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] broke out in 1739 between the Spanish and British and was confined to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. The major action in the War of Jenkins' Ear was a major [[amphibious attack]] launched by the British under Admiral [[Edward Vernon]] in March 1741 against [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|Cartagena de Indias]], one of Spain's major gold-trading ports in the Caribbean (today [[Colombia]]). Although this episode is largely forgotten, it ended in a decisive victory for Spain, who managed to prolong its control of the Caribbean and indeed secure the [[Spanish Main]] until the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nFollowing the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]], the British troops invaded and captured the Spanish cities of [[Havana]] in [[Cuba]] and [[Manila]] in the Philippines in 1762. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] gave Spain control over the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] part of [[New France]] including [[New Orleans]], creating a Spanish empire that stretched from the [[Mississippi River]] to the Pacific Ocean; but Spain also ceded [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to Great Britain in order to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Louisiana settlers, hoping to restore the territory to France, in the bloodless [[Louisiana Rebellion of 1768|Rebellion of 1768]] forced the [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Antonio de Ulloa]] to flee to Spain. The rebellion was crushed in 1769 by the next governor [[Alejandro O'Reilly]], who executed five of the conspirators. The Louisiana territory was to be administered by superiors in Cuba with a governor on site in New Orleans.\n\nThe 21 northern [[Spanish missions in California#Present-day California missions|missions in present-day California]] (U.S.) were established along California's [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] from 1769. In an effort to exclude Britain and Russia from the eastern Pacific, King [[Charles III of Spain]] sent forth from Mexico a number of [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] between 1774 and 1793. Spain's long-held claims and navigation rights were strengthened and a settlement and fort were built in [[Nootka Sound]], Alaska.\n\n[[File:Cuadro por espa\u00f1a y por el rey, Galvez en America.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]] and his army at the [[Siege of Pensacola]] in 1781.]]\n\nSpain entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] as an ally of the United States and France in June 1779. From September 1779 to May 1781, [[Bernardo de Galvez]] led an army in a campaign along the [[Gulf Coast]] against the British. Galvez's army consisted of Spanish regulars from throughout Latin America and a militia which consisted of mostly [[Acadians]] along with Creoles, Germans, and Native Americans. Galvez's army engaged and defeated the British in battles fought at [[Capture of Fort Bute|Manchac]] and [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Baton Rouge]], Louisiana, [[Fort Rosalie|Natchez]], Mississippi, [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]], Alabama, and [[Siege of Pensacola|Pensacola]], Florida. The loss of Mobile and Pensacola left the British with no bases along the Gulf Coast. In 1782, forces under Galvez's overall command [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|captured the British naval base]] at [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on [[New Providence]] Island in the [[Bahamas]]. Galvez was angry that the operation had proceeded against his orders to cancel, and ordered the arrest and imprisonment of [[Francisco de Miranda]], [[aide-de-camp]] of [[Juan Manuel Cajigal]], the commander of the expedition. Miranda later ascribed this action on the part of Galvez to jealousy of Cajigal's success.\n\nIn the second [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the American Revolution, Great Britain returned control of Florida back to Spain in exchange for the Bahamas. Spain then had control over the Mississippi River south of 32\u00b030' north latitude, and, in what is known as the Spanish Conspiracy, hoped to gain greater control of Louisiana and all of the west. These hopes ended when Spain was pressured into signing [[Pinckney's Treaty]] in 1795. France re-acquired Louisiana from Spain in the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1800. The United States bought the territory from France in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.\n[[File:NutcaEN.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Spanish territorial claims in the northern West Coast of North America, 18th century]]\n\nNew Spain claimed the entire west coast of North America and therefore considered the Russian fur trading activity in Alaska, which began in the middle to late 18th century, an encroachment and threat. Likewise, the exploration of the northwest coast by Captain [[James Cook]] of the British Navy and the subsequent fur trading activities by British ships was considered an encroachment on Spanish territory. To protect and strengthen its claim, New Spain sent a number of [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] between 1774 and 1793. In 1789, a naval outpost called [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]] (or just Nuca) was established at [[Friendly Cove]] in [[Nootka Sound]] (now Yuquot), [[Vancouver Island]]. It was protected by an [[artillery battery|artillery]] [[land battery]] called [[Fort San Miguel]]. Santa Cruz de Nuca was the northernmost establishment of New Spain. It was the first European colony in what is now the province of [[British Columbia]] and the only Spanish settlement in what is now [[Canada]]. Santa Cruz de Nuca remained under the control of New Spain until 1795, when it was abandoned under the terms of the third [[Nootka Convention]]. Another outpost, intended to replace Santa Cruz de Nuca, was partially built at [[Neah Bay, Washington|Neah Bay]] on the southern side of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] in what is now the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Neah Bay was known as ''Bah\u00eda de N\u00fa\u00f1ez Gaona'' in New Spain, and the outpost there was referred to as \"Fuca.\" It was abandoned, partially finished, in 1792. Its personnel, livestock, cannons, and ammunition were transferred to Nuca.<ref>{{harvp|Tovell|2008|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref>\n\nIn 1789, at Santa Cruz de Nuca, a conflict occurred between the Spanish naval officer [[Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Fern\u00e1ndez y Mart\u00ednez de la Sierra|Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and the British merchant [[James Colnett]], triggering the [[Nootka Crisis]], which grew into an [[international incident]] and the threat of war between Britain and Spain. The first [[Nootka Convention]] averted the war but left many specific issues unresolved. Both sides sought to define a northern boundary for New Spain. At Nootka Sound, the diplomatic representative of New Spain, [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]], proposed a boundary at the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but the British representative, [[George Vancouver]] refused to accept any boundary north of [[San Francisco]]. No agreement could be reached and the northern boundary of New Spain remained unspecified until the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] with the United States (1819). That treaty also ceded [[Spanish Florida]] to the United States.\n\n==End of the Viceroyalty (1806\u20131821)==\nThe [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] ceded to France the vast territory that [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] then sold to the United States in 1803, known as the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The United States obtained [[Spanish Florida]] in 1819 in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]]. That treaty also defined a northern border for New Spain, at 42d north (now the northern boundary of the U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah).\n\nIn the 1821 [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], both Mexico and Central America declared their independence after three centuries of Spanish rule and formed the [[First Mexican Empire]], although Central America quickly rejected the union. After priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s 1810 [[Grito de Dolores]] (call for independence), the insurgent army began an eleven-year war. At first, the [[Criollo class]] fought against the rebels. But in 1820, a military coup in Spain forced Ferdinand VII to accept the authority of the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Spanish Constitution]]. The specter of liberalism that could undermine the authority and autonomy of the Roman Catholic Church made the Church hierarchy in New Spain view independence in a different light. In an independent nation, the Church anticipated retaining its power. Royalist military officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] proposed uniting with the insurgents with whom he had battled, and gained the alliance of [[Vicente Guerrero]], leader of the insurgents in a region now bearing his name. Royal government collapsed in New Spain and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] marched triumphantly into Mexico City in 1821.\n\nThe new [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] offered the crown to [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] or to a member of the Spanish royal family that he would designate. After the refusal of the Spanish monarchy to recognize the independence of Mexico, the ''{{lang|es|ej\u00e9rcito Trigarante}}'' ([[Army of the Three Guarantees]]), led by Agust\u00edn de Iturbide and [[Vicente Guerrero]], cut all political and economic ties with Spain and crowned Iturbide as [[List of Emperors of Mexico|emperor Agust\u00edn of Mexico]]. Central America was originally planned to be part of the Mexican Empire; but it seceded peacefully in 1823, forming the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]] under the [[Constitution of 1824]].\n\nThis left only [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] in the [[Spanish West Indies]], and the [[Spanish East Indies]] in the Spanish Empire; until their loss to the United States in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898).\n\n== Political organization ==\nThe Viceroyalty of New Spain united many regions and provinces of the Spanish Empire throughout half a world. These included on the North American mainland, central Mexico, [[Nueva Extremadura]], [[Nueva Galicia]], [[the Californias]], [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Nuevo Reyno de Le\u00f3n]], [[Spanish Texas|Texas]] and [[Nuevo Santander]], as well as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]].\n\nIn the Caribbean it included Cuba, [[Colony of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], most of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan mainland]] and the other islands in the Caribbean controlled by the Spanish. In Asia, the Viceroyalty ruled the [[Spanish East Indies|Captaincy General of the Philippines]], which covered all of the Spanish territories in the Asia-Pacific region. The outpost at Nootka Sound, on [[Vancouver Island]], was considered part of the province of California.\n\nTherefore, the Viceroyalty's former territories included what is now the countries of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]]; the United States states and territories of [[California]], [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Florida]]; a portion of the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]; the Caribbean nations of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], the island of [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; the Asia-Pacific nations of the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], [[Mariana Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Palau]] and [[Caroline Islands]], as well as during a century the island of [[Tidore]] in [[Indonesia]].\n\nThe Viceroyalty was administered by a [[viceroy]] residing in [[Mexico City]] and appointed by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish monarch]], who had administrative oversight of all of these regions, although most matters were handled by the local governmental bodies, which ruled the various regions of the viceroyalty. First among these were the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s'', which were primarily superior tribunals, but which also had administrative and legislative functions. Each of these was responsible to the Viceroy of New Spain in administrative matters (though not in judicial ones), but they also answered directly to the [[Council of the Indies]].\n\nAudiencia districts further incorporated the older, smaller divisions known as [[governorate]]s (''gobernaciones'', roughly equivalent to [[provinces]]), which had been originally established by conquistador-governors known as ''[[adelantado]]s''. Provinces which were under military threat were grouped into [[Captaincy|captaincies general]], such as the Captaincies General of the Philippines (established 1574) and Guatemala (established in 1609) mentioned above, which were joint military and political commands with a certain level of autonomy. (The viceroy was captain-general of those provinces that remained directly under his command).\n\nAt the local level there were over two hundred districts, in both Indian and Spanish areas, which were headed by either a ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'' (also known as an ''alcalde mayor'') or a ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' (town council), both of which had judicial and administrative powers. In the late 18th century the Bourbon dynasty began phasing out the ''corregidores'' and introduced [[intendant]]s, whose broad fiscal powers cut into the authority of the viceroys, governors and ''cabildos''. Despite their late creation, these intendancies so affected the formation of regional identity that they became the basis for the nations of Central America and the first Mexican states after independence.\n\n===Captaincies general===\nThe [[Captaincy General]]s were the second-level [[administrative division]]s and these were relatively [[autonomous]].\nWith dates of creation:\n\n#[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1535)\n#[[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]] (1574)\n#[[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] (1580)\n#[[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] (1607)\n##Governorate of [[Spanish Florida]], (Spanish: ''La Florida'') (the [[Governorate#Spanish Empire|governorate]]s were a third-level administrative divisions)\n##Governorate of [[Spanish Louisiana]] (Spanish: ''Luisiana'')\n#[[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]] (1609)\n#[[Captaincy General of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] (1617)\n#[[Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]] (1776) (analogous to a dependent captaincy general)\n\n===Intendancies===\nAs part of the sweeping eighteenth-century administrative and economic changes known as the [[Bourbon Reforms]], the Spanish crown created new administrative units called [[Intendant (government official)|intendancies]]. The intendencies aimed at strengthening Crown control over the viceroyalty and measures aimed to break the monopoly that local elites had in the municipal government in order to improve the economy of the empire, and other reforms including the improvement of the public participation in communal affairs, distribution of undeveloped lands to the Indians and Spaniards, end the corruption practices of the mayors, it also sought to favor handicrafts and encourage trade and mining, and establish a system of territorial division similar to the model created by the government of [[Kingdom of France|France]], already adopted in Spain. These acted together with the general captaincies and the viceroyalties, they never changed the traditional administrative divisions, intendancies found strong resistance by the viceroyalties, general captaincies (also found great rejection in the Iberian peninsula when it was adopted), royal audiencias and ecclesiastical hierarchs for its important intervention in economic issues, by its centralist politics and by its opposition to cede very much of their functions to the intendants, to whom they bound them with a crown absolutism; in this context there was the outbreak of the [[American Revolution|Revolution of Independence of the English colonies in North America]], which forced to protest the central points of the reformist program in the Spanish Americas, because due to the war with England in which Spain participated, it was not convenient to apply for the moment drastic measures that would put at risk the financial support of the Spanish-American subsidies; all this prevented its full application.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.iberlibro.com/9789684441798/Historia-Mexico-Proceso-Gestacion-Pueblo-9684441797/plp|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico.

In New Spain the high court was established in 1527, prior to the establishment of the viceroyalty. The First Audiencia was headed by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]'s rival [[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]], who used the court to deprive Cort\u00e9s of power and property. The First Audiencia was dissolved and the Second Audiencia established.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=69}}</ref>\n\nAudiencias with dates of creation:\n\n#[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1511, effective 1526, predated the Viceroyalty)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Mexico|Mexico]] (1527, predated the Viceroyalty)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Panama|Panama]] (1st one, 1538\u20131543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Guatemala]] (1543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] (1548)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Manila|Manila]] (1583)\n\n==Regions of mainland New Spain==\nIn the colonial period, basic patterns of regional development emerged and strengthened.<ref name=\"provinces\">{{harvp|Lockhart|Altman|1976}}</ref> European settlement and institutional life was built in the [[Mesoamerican]] heartland of the [[Aztec Empire]] in Central Mexico. The South (Oaxaca, Michoacan, Yucat\u00e1n, and Central America) was a region of dense indigenous settlement of Mesoamerica, but without exploitable resources of interest to Europeans, the area attracted few Europeans, while the indigenous presence remained strong. The North was outside the area of complex indigenous populations, inhabited primarily by nomadic and hostile northern indigenous groups. With the discovery of silver in the north, the Spanish sought to conquer or pacify those peoples in order to exploit the mines and develop enterprises to supply them. Nonetheless, much of northern New Spain had sparse indigenous population and attracted few Europeans. The Spanish crown and later the Republic of Mexico did not effectively exert sovereignty over the region, leaving it vulnerable to the expansionism of the United States in the nineteenth century.\n\nRegional characteristics of colonial Mexico have been the focus of considerable study within the vast scholarship on centers and peripheries.<ref name=\"provinces\"/><ref>{{harvp|Van Young|1992}}</ref> For those based in the vice-regal capital of Mexico City itself, everywhere else were the \"provinces.\" Even in the modern era, \"Mexico\" for many refers solely to Mexico City, with the pejorative view of anywhere but the capital is a hopeless backwater.<ref>{{harvp|Monsiva\u00eds|1992|pp=247\u2013254}}</ref> \"Fuera de M\u00e9xico, todo es Cuauhtitl\u00e1n\" [\"outside of Mexico City, it's all Podunk\"],<ref>{{harvp|Van Young|1992|loc=p. 3 n. 3}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Van Young|2006|p=xxviii}}</ref> that is, poor, marginal, and backward, in short, the periphery. The picture is far more complex, however; while the capital is enormously important as the center of power of various kinds (institutional, economic, social), the provinces played a significant role in colonial Mexico. Regions (provinces) developed and thrived to the extent that they were sites of economic production and tied into networks of trade. \"Spanish society in the Indies was import-export oriented at the very base and in every aspect,\" and the development of many regional economies was usually centered on support of that export sector.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Central region===\n====Mexico City, Capital of the Viceroyalty====\n{{Main|History of Mexico City}}\nMexico City was the center of the Central region, and the hub of New Spain. The [[history of Mexico City|development of Mexico City]] itself is extremely important to the development of New Spain as a whole. It was the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church, the Holy Office of the [[Inquisition]], the merchants' guild (''consulado''), and home of the most elite families in the Kingdom of New Spain. Mexico City was the single-most populous city, not just in New Spain, but for many years the entire Western Hemisphere, with a high concentration of mixed-race [[castas]].\n\n====Veracruz to Mexico City====\nSignificant regional development grew along the main transportation route from the capital east to the port of Veracruz. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] called this area \"Mesa de Anahuac\", which can be defined as the adjacent valleys of Puebla, Mexico, and Toluca, enclosed by high mountains, along with their connections to the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz and the Pacific port of [[Acapulco]], where over half the population of New Spain lived.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|loc=map 2 p. 6; p. 288}}</ref> These valleys were linked trunk lines, or main routes, facilitating the movement of vital goods and people to get to key areas.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1991}}</ref> However, even in this relatively richly endowed region of Mexico, the difficulty of transit of people and goods in the absence of rivers and level terrain remained a major challenge to the economy of New Spain. This challenge persisted during the post-independence years until the late nineteenth-century construction of railroads. In the colonial era and up until the railroads were built in key areas, mule trains were the main mode of transporting goods. Mules were used because unpaved roads and mountainous terrain could not generally accommodate carts.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century the crown devoted some resources to the study and remedy the problem of poor roads. The Camino Real (royal road) between the port of Veracruz and the capital had some short sections paved and bridges constructed. The construction was done despite protests from some Indian villages when the infrastructure improvements, which sometimes included rerouting the road through communal lands. The Spanish crown finally decided that road improvement was in the interests of the state for military purposes, as well as for fomenting commerce, agriculture, and industry, but the lack of state involvement in the development of physical infrastructure was to have lasting effects constraining development until the late nineteenth century.<ref>{{harvp|Castleman|2005|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Coatsworth|1998|p=34}}</ref> Despite some improvements, the roads still made transit difficult, particularly for heavy military equipment.\n\nAlthough the crown had ambitious plans for both the Toluca and Veracruz portions of the king's highway, actual improvements were limited to a localized network.<ref>{{harvp|Castleman|2005|p=31}}</ref> Even where infrastructure was improved, transit on the Veracruz-Puebla main road had other obstacles, with wolves attacking mule trains, killing animals, and rendering some sacks of foodstuffs unsellable because they were smeared with blood.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=90}}</ref> The north-south Acapulco route remained a mule track through mountainous terrain.\n\n====Veracruz, port city and province====\nVeracruz was the first Spanish settlement founded in what became New Spain, and it endured as the only viable Gulf Coast port, the gateway for Spain to New Spain. The difficult topography around the port affected local development and New Spain as a whole. Going from the port to the central plateau entailed a daunting 2000 meter climb from the narrow tropical coastal plain in just over a hundred kilometers. The narrow, slippery road in the mountain mists was treacherous for mule trains, and in some cases mules were hoisted by ropes. Many tumbled with their cargo to their deaths.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=68}}</ref> Given these transport constraints, only high-value, low-bulk goods continued to be shipped in the transatlantic trade, which stimulated local production of foodstuffs, rough textiles, and other products for a mass market. Although New Spain produced considerable sugar and wheat, these were consumed exclusively in the colony even though there was demand elsewhere. Philadelphia, not New Spain, supplied Cuba with wheat.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=67}}, quoting Alexander von Humboldt.</ref>\n\nThe Caribbean port of Veracruz was small, with its hot, pestilential climate not a draw for permanent settlers: its population never topped 10,000.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1991|p=3}}</ref> Many Spanish merchants preferred living in the pleasant highland town of Jalapa (1,500 m). For a brief period (1722\u201376) the town of Jalapa became even more important than Veracruz, after it was granted the right to hold the royal trade fair for New Spain, serving as the entrepot for goods from Asia via [[Manila Galleon]] through the port of Acapulco and European goods via the flota (convoy) from the Spanish port of C\u00e1diz.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1979|p=124}}</ref> Spaniards also settled in the temperate area of Orizaba, east of the Citlaltepetl volcano. Orizaba varied considerably in elevation from {{convert|800|m}} to {{convert|5700|m}} (the summit of the Citlaltepetl volcano), but \"most of the inhabited part is temperate.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=205}}</ref> Some Spaniards lived in semitropical C\u00f3rdoba, which was founded as a villa in 1618, to serve as a Spanish base against runaway slave ([[cimarr\u00f3nes|cimarr\u00f3n]]) predations on mule trains traveling the route from the port to the capital. Some cimarr\u00f3n settlements sought autonomy, such as one led by [[Gaspar Yanga]], with whom the crown concluded a treaty leading to the recognition of a largely black town, San Lorenzo de los Negros de Cerralvo, now called the municipality of Yanga.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nEuropean diseases immediately affected the multiethnic Indian populations in the Veracruz area and for that reason Spaniards imported black slaves as either an alternative to indigenous labor or its complete replacement in the event of a repetition of the Caribbean die-off. A few Spaniards acquired prime agricultural lands left vacant by the indigenous demographic disaster. Portions of the province could support sugar cultivation and as early as the 1530s sugar production was underway. New Spain's first viceroy, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] established an hacienda on lands taken from Orizaba.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=206}}</ref>\n\nIndians resisted cultivating sugarcane themselves, preferring to tend their subsistence crops. As in the Caribbean, black slave labor became crucial to the development of sugar estates. During the period 1580\u20131640 when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch and Portuguese slave traders had access to Spanish markets, African slaves were imported in large numbers to New Spain and many of them remained in the region of Veracruz. But even when that connection was broken and prices rose, black slaves remained an important component of C\u00f3rdoba's labor sector even after 1700. Rural estates in C\u00f3rdoba depended on African slave labor, who were 20% of the population there, a far greater proportion than any other area of New Spain, and greater than even nearby Jalapa.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1991|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn 1765 the crown created a monopoly on tobacco, which directly affected agriculture and manufacturing in the Veracruz region. Tobacco was a valuable, high-demand product. Men, women, and even children smoked, something commented on by foreign travelers and depicted in eighteenth-century [[casta]] paintings.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|pp=188\u2013189}}</ref> The crown calculated that tobacco could produce a steady stream of tax revenues by supplying the huge Mexican demand, so the crown limited zones of tobacco cultivation. It also established a small number of manufactories of finished products, and licensed distribution outlets (''estanquillos'').<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992}}. This is the definitive study of the tobacco monopoly.</ref> The crown also set up warehouses to store up to a year's worth of supplies, including paper for cigarettes, for the manufactories.<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992|p=106}}</ref> With the establishment of the monopoly, crown revenues increased and there is evidence that despite high prices and expanding rates of poverty, tobacco consumption rose while at the same time, general consumption fell.<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992|p=157}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]] Veracruz became an [[intendancy]], a new administrative unit.\n\n====Valley of Puebla====\nFounded in 1531 as a Spanish settlement, [[Puebla de los Angeles]] quickly rose to the status of Mexico's second-most important city. Its location on the main route between the viceregal capital and the port of Veracruz, in a fertile basin with a dense indigenous population, largely not held in encomienda, made Puebla a destination for many later arriving Spaniards. If there had been significant mineral wealth in Puebla, it could have been even more prominent a center for New Spain, but its first century established its importance. In 1786 it became the capital of an [[intendancy]] of the same name.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=220\u2013224}}</ref>\n\nIt became the seat of the richest diocese in New Spain in its first century, with the seat of the first diocese, formerly in Tlaxcala, moved there in 1543.<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1952|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Bishop [[Juan de Palafox]] asserted the income from the diocese of Puebla as being twice that of the archbishopic of Mexico, due to the tithe income derived from agriculture.<ref>{{harvp|Israel|1975|p=219}}</ref> In its first hundred years, Puebla was prosperous from wheat farming and other agriculture, as the ample tithe income indicates, plus manufacturing woolen cloth for the domestic market. Merchants, manufacturers, and artisans were important to the city's economic fortunes, but its early prosperity was followed by stagnation and decline in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe foundation of the town of Puebla was a pragmatic social experiment to settle Spanish immigrants without encomiendas to pursue farming and industry.<ref name=\"Hirschberg\">{{harvp|Hirschberg|1979}}</ref> Puebla was privileged in a number of ways, starting with its status as a Spanish settlement not founded on existing indigenous city-state, but with a significant indigenous population. It was located in a fertile basin on a temperate plateau in the nexus of the key trade triangle of Veracruz\u2013Mexico City\u2013Antequera (Oaxaca). Although there were no encomiendas in Puebla itself, encomenderos with nearby labor grants settled in Puebla. And despite its foundation as a Spanish city, sixteenth-century Puebla had Indians resident in the central core.<ref name=\"Hirschberg\"/>\n\nAdministratively Puebla was far enough away from Mexico City (approximately {{convert|160|km|abbr=on|disp=or|-1}}) so as not to be under its direct influence. Puebla's Spanish town council (cabildo) had considerable autonomy and was not dominated by encomenderos. The administrative structure of Puebla \"may be seen as a subtle expression of royal absolutism, the granting of extensive privileges to a town of commoners, amounting almost to republican self-government, in order to curtail the potential authority of encomenderos and the religious orders, as well as to counterbalance the power of the viceregal capital.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"golden century\" from its founding in 1531 until the early 1600s, Puebla's agricultural sector flourished, with small-scale Spanish farmers plowing the land for the first time, planting wheat and vaulting Puebla to importance as New Spain's breadbasket, a role assumed by the [[Baj\u00edo]] (including Quer\u00e9taro) in the seventeenth century, and Guadalajara in the eighteenth.<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=12}}</ref> Puebla's wheat production was the initial element of its prosperity, but it emerged as a manufacturing and commercial center, \"serving as the inland port of Mexico's Atlantic trade.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989}}, citing Pierre Chaunu ''Seville et l'Atlantique 1504\u20131650'', Pt. 2, vol. VIII 1959, 714.</ref> Economically, the city received exemptions from the ''alcabala'' (sales tax) and ''almojarifazgo'' (import/export duties) for its first century (1531\u20131630), which helped promote commerce.\n\nPuebla built a significant manufacturing sector, mainly in textile production in workshops (obrajes), supplying New Spain and markets as far away as Guatemala and Peru. Transatlantic ties between a particular Spanish town, [[Brihuega]], and Puebla demonstrate the close connection between the two settlements. The take-off for Puebla's manufacturing sector did not simply coincide with immigration from Brihuega but was crucial to \"shaping and driving Puebla's economic development, especially in the manufacturing sector.\"<ref>{{harvp|Altman|2000|p=51}}</ref> Brihuega immigrants not only came to Mexico with expertise in textile production, but the transplanted briocenses provided capital to create large-scale obrajes. Although obrajes in Brihuega were small-scale enterprises, quite a number of them in Puebla employed up to 100 workers. Supplies of wool, water for fulling mills, and labor (free indigenous, incarcerated Indians, black slaves) were available. Although much of Puebla's textile output was rough cloth, it also produced higher quality dyed cloth with [[cochineal]] from Oaxaca and [[indigo]] from [[Guatemala]].<ref>{{harvp|Altman|2000|p=62}}</ref> But by the eighteenth century, [[Quer\u00e9taro]] had displaced Puebla as the mainstay of woolen textile production.<ref>{{harvp|Salvucci|1987|p=80}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787, Puebla became an [[intendancy]] as part of the new administrative structuring of the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n====Valley of Mexico====\nMexico City dominated the Valley of Mexico, but the valley continued to have dense indigenous populations challenged by growing, increasingly dense Spanish settlement. The Valley of Mexico had many former Indian city-states that became Indian towns in the colonial era. These towns continued to be ruled by indigenous elites under the Spanish crown, with an indigenous governor and a town councils.<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1964}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1992}}</ref> These Indian towns close to the capital were the most desirable ones for encomenderos to hold and for the friars to evangelize.\n\nThe capital was provisioned by the indigenous towns, and its labor was available for enterprises that ultimately created a colonial economy. The gradual drying up of the central lake system created more dry land for farming, but the sixteenth-century population declines allowed Spaniards to expand their acquisition of land. One region that retained strong Indian land holding was the southern fresh water area, with important suppliers of fresh produce to the capital. The area was characterized by intensely cultivated chinampas, man-made extensions of cultivable land into the lake system. These chinampa towns retained a strong indigenous character, and Indians continued to hold the majority of that land, despite its closeness to the Spanish capital. A key example is [[Xochimilco]].<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1964|p=409}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cline|1991|pp=265\u2013274}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Rojas Rabiela|1991}}</ref>\n\nTexcoco in the pre-conquest period was one of the three members of the Aztec Triple Alliance and the cultural center of the empire. It fell on hard times in the colonial period as an economic backwater. Spaniards with any ambition or connections would be lured by the closeness of Mexico City, so that the Spanish presence was minimal and marginal.<ref>{{harvp|Lewis|1976}}</ref>\n\nTlaxcala, the major ally of the Spanish against the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, also became something of a backwater, but like Puebla it did not come under the control of Spanish encomenderos. No elite Spaniards settled there, but like many other Indian towns in the Valley of Mexico, it had an assortment of small-scale merchants, artisans, farmers and ranchers, and textile workshops (obrajes).<ref>{{harvp|Szewczyk|1976}}</ref>\n\n===The North===\nSince portions of northern New Spain became part of the United States' [[Southwest United States|Southwest region]], there has been considerable scholarship on the Spanish borderlands in the north. The motor of the Spanish colonial economy was the extraction of [[silver]]. In [[Bolivia]], it was from the single rich mountain of [[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potos\u00ed]]; but in New Spain, there were two major mining sites, one in [[Zacatecas]], the other in [[Guanajuato]].\n\nThe region farther north of the main mining zones attracted few Spanish settlers. Where there were settled [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]], such as in the present-day state of [[New Mexico]] and in coastal regions of [[Baja California (region)|Baja]] and [[Alta California]], indigenous culture retained considerable integrity.\n\n====The Baj\u00edo, Mexico's Breadbasket====\nThe [[Baj\u00edo]], a rich, fertile lowland just north of central Mexico, was nonetheless a frontier region between the densely populated plateaus and valleys of Mexico's center and south and the harsh northern desert controlled by nomadic Chichimeca. Devoid of settled indigenous populations in the early sixteenth century, the Baj\u00edo did not initially attract Spaniards, who were much more interested in exploiting labor and collecting tribute whenever possible. The region did not have indigenous populations that practiced subsistence agriculture. The Baj\u00edo developed in the colonial period as a region of commercial agriculture.\n\nThe discovery of mining deposits in Zacatecas and Guanajuato in the mid-sixteenth century and later in San Luis Potos\u00ed stimulated the Baj\u00edo's development to supply the mines with food and livestock. A network of Spanish towns was established in this region of commercial agriculture, with Quer\u00e9taro also becoming a center of textile production. Although there were no dense indigenous populations or network of settlements, Indians migrated to the Baj\u00edo to work as resident employees on the region's haciendas and ranchos or rented land (terrasguerros). From diverse cultural backgrounds and with no sustaining indigenous communities, these indios were quickly hispanized, but largely remained at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1986|pp=52\u201354}}</ref> Although Indians migrated willingly to the region, they did so in such small numbers that labor shortages prompted Spanish hacendados to provide incentives to attract workers, especially in the initial boom period of the early seventeenth century. Land owners lent workers money, which could be seen as a perpetual indebtedness, but it can be seen not as coercing Indians to stay but a way estate owners sweetened their terms of employment, beyond their basic wage labor.<ref>{{harvp|Brading|1978|pp=76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|pp=339\u2013378}}</ref> For example, in 1775 the Spanish administrator of a San Luis Potos\u00ed estate \"had to scour both Mexico City and the northern towns to find enough blue French linen to satisfy the resident employees.\"<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=354}}</ref> Other types of goods they received on credit were textiles, hats, shoes, candles, meat, beans, and a guaranteed ration of maize. However, where labor was more abundant or market conditions depressed, estate owners paid lower wages. The more sparsely populated northern Baj\u00edo tended to pay higher wages than the southern Baj\u00edo, which was increasingly integrated in the economy of central Mexico.<ref name=\"Tutino_1979_364\">{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=364}}</ref> The credit-based employment system often privileged those holding higher ranked positions on the estate (supervisors, craftsmen, other specialists) who were mostly white, and the estates did not demand repayment.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=363}}</ref>\n\nIn the late colonial period, renting complemented estate employment for many non-Indians in more central areas of the Baj\u00edo with access to markets. As with hacendados, renters produced for the commercial market. While these Baj\u00edo renters could prosper in good times and achieved a level of independence, drought and other disasters made their choice more risky than beneficial.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=366}}</ref>\n\nMany renters retained ties to the estates, diversifying their household's sources of income and level of economic security. In San Luis Potos\u00ed, rentals were fewer and estate employment the norm. After a number of years of drought and bad harvests in the first decade of the nineteenth century Hidalgo's 1810 grito appealed more in the Baj\u00edo than in San Luis Potos\u00ed. In the Baj\u00edo estate owners were evicting tenants in favor of renters better able to pay more for land, there was a disruption of previous patterns of mutual benefit between estate owners and renters.<ref name=\"Tutino_1979_364\"/>\n\n===Spanish Borderlands===\nAreas of northern Mexico were incorporated into the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, following Texas independence and the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348) and generally known as the \"Spanish Borderlands.\"<ref>{{harvp|Bannon|1974}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Weber|1991}}</ref> Scholars in the United States have extensively studied this northern region, which became the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.<ref>{{harvp|Bolton|1956}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cutter|1995}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Spicer|1962}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Weber|1992}}</ref> During the period of Spanish rule, this area was sparsely populated even by indigenous peoples.<ref>{{harvp|Jackson|1994}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Presidio]]s (forts), [[pueblo]]s (civilian towns) and the [[List of Spanish missions|misiones]] (missions) were the three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial holdings in these territories.\n\n====Missions and the Northern Frontier====\nThe town of [[Albuquerque]] (present day Albuquerque, [[New Mexico]]) was founded in 1706. Other Mexican towns in the region included Paso del Norte (present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]), founded in 1667; Santiago de la [[Monclova]] in 1689; Panzacola, Tejas in 1681; and San Francisco de Cu\u00e9llar (present day city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]) in 1709. From 1687, [[Father Kino|Father Eusebio Francisco Kino]], with funding from the Marqu\u00e9s de Villapuente, founded over twenty [[Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert|missions]] in the [[Sonoran Desert]] (in present-day [[Sonora]] and Arizona). From 1697, Jesuits established eighteen [[Spanish missions in California#Missions in present-day Baja California (Mexico)|missions throughout the Baja California Peninsula]]. Between 1687 and 1700 several [[Spanish missions in Trinidad|missions were founded in Trinidad]], but only four survived as Amerindian villages throughout the 18th century. In 1691, explorers and missionaries visited the interior of Texas and came upon a river and Amerindian settlement on 13 June, the feast day of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]], and named the location and river [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] in his honor.\n\n====New Mexico====\nDuring the term of [[viceroy]] Don [[Luis de Velasco, marqu\u00e9s de Salinas]] the crown ended the long-running [[Chichimeca War]] by making peace with the semi-nomadic [[Chichimeca]] indigenous tribes of northern M\u00e9xico in 1591. This allowed expansion into the 'Province of New Mexico' or ''[[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Provincia de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]''. In 1595, Don [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]], son of one the key figures in the silver remining region of Zacatecas, received official permission from the viceroy to explore and conquer New Mexico. As was the pattern of such expeditions, the leader assumed the greatest risk but would reap the largest rewards, so that O\u00f1ate would become ''capit\u00e1n general'' of New Mexico and had the authority to distribute rewards to those in the expedition.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|pp=193\u2013194}}</ref> O\u00f1ate pioneered 'The Royal Road of the Interior Land' or ''[[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]]'' between [[Mexico City]] and the [[Tewa people|Tewa]] village of [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], or San Juan Pueblo. He also founded the Spanish settlement of [[San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge]] on the [[Rio Grande]] near the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Pueblo, located just north of the present day city of [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]].<ref>{{harvp|Sanchez|Spude|2013|loc=Chapters 2 & 3}}</ref>\n\nHowever, O\u00f1ate eventually learned that New Mexico, while it had a settled indigenous population, contained little arable land, had no silver mines, and possessed few other resources to exploit that would merit large scale colonization. Accordingly, he resigned as governor in 1607 and left New Mexico, having spent much of his personal wealth on the enterprise.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=194}}</ref>\n\nIn 1610, [[Pedro de Peralta]], a later [[Spanish governors of New Mexico|governor of the Province of New Mexico]], established the settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] near the southern end of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains|Sangre de Cristo]] mountain range. [[List of Spanish missions|Missions]] were established to convert the locals, and manage the agricultural industry. The territory's [[Puebloan peoples|indigenous population]] resented the Spanish prohibition of their traditional religion, and the [[encomienda]] system of forced labor. The unrest led to the [[Pueblo Revolt]] in 1680, forcing the Spanish to retreat to Paso del Norte (modern-day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].) After the return of the Spanish in 1692, the final resolution included a marked reduction of Spanish efforts to eradicate native culture and religion, the issuing of substantial communal [[land grant]]s to each Pueblo, and a public defender of their rights and for their legal cases in Spanish courts. In 1776 the Province came under the new [[Provincias Internas]] jurisdiction. In the late 18th century the [[Spanish land grants in New Mexico|Spanish land grant]] encouraged the settlement by individuals of large land parcels outside [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] and Pueblo boundaries, many of which became ranchos.<ref>{{harvp|Gonzales|2003}}</ref>\n\n====California====\nIn 1602, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]], the first Spanish presence in the 'New California' (''Nueva California'') region of the frontier [[Las Californias]] province since Cabrillo in 1542, sailed as far north up the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] as present-day [[Oregon]], and named California coastal features from [[San Diego]] to as far north as [[Monterey Bay|the Bay of Monterrey]].\n\nNot until the eighteenth century was California of much interest to the Spanish crown, since it had no known rich mineral deposits or indigenous populations sufficiently organized to render tribute and do labor for Spaniards. The [[California gold rush|discovery of huge deposits of gold]] in the Sierra Nevada foothills did not come until after the U.S. had incorporated California following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348).\n\nBy the middle of the 1700s, the Catholic order of [[Jesuits]] had established a number of missions on the [[Baja California Peninsula|''Baja'' (lower) California peninsula]]. Then, in 1767, [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] ordered all Jesuits expelled from all Spanish possessions, including New Spain.<ref>{{harvp|Weber|1992|p=242}}</ref> New Spain's Visitador General [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] replaced them with the [[Dominican Order]] in Baja California, and the [[Franciscans]] were chosen to establish new northern missions in [[Alta California|''Alta'' (upper) California]].\n\nIn 1768, G\u00e1lvez received the following orders: \"Occupy and fortify San Diego and Monterey for God and the King of Spain.\" The [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization there, with far fewer known natural resources and less cultural development than Mexico or Peru, was to combine establishing a presence for defense of the territory with a perceived responsibility to convert the indigenous people to Christianity.\n\nThe method used to \"occupy and fortify\" was the established Spanish colonial system: [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] (''misiones'', between 1769 and 1833 twenty-one missions were established) aimed at converting the [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Californians]] to Christianity, [[presidio|forts]] (''presidios'', four total) to protect the missionaries, and secular [[pueblo (disambiguation)|municipalities]] (''pueblos'', three total). Due to the region's great distance from supplies and support in M\u00e9xico, the system had to be largely self-sufficient. As a result, the colonial population of California remained small, widely scattered and near the coast.\n\nIn 1776, the north-western frontier areas came under the administration of the new 'Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North' ''([[Provincias Internas]])'', designed to streamline administration and invigorate growth. The crown created two new provincial governments from the former [[Las Californias]] in 1804; the southern peninsula became Baja California, and the ill-defined northern mainland frontier area became Alta California.\n\nOnce missions and protective presidios were established in an area, large [[Spanish land grants in California|land grants]] encouraged settlement and establishment of [[Ranchos of California|California ranchos]]. The Spanish system of land grants was not very successful, however, because the grants were merely royal concessions\u2014not actual land ownership. Under later Mexican rule, land grants conveyed ownership, and were more successful at promoting settlement.\n\nRancho activities centered on cattle-raising; many grantees emulated the [[Don (honorific)|Dons]] of [[Spain]], with cattle, horses and sheep the source of wealth. The work was usually done by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], sometimes displaced and/or relocated from their villages. Native-born descendants of the resident Spanish-heritage rancho grantees, soldiers, servants, merchants, craftsmen and others became the [[Californio]]s. Many of the less-affluent men took native wives, and many daughters married later English, French and American settlers.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1821) and subsequent [[secularization]] (\"disestablishment\") of the missions (1834), Mexican land grant transactions increased the spread of the rancho system. The land grants and ranchos established mapping and land-ownership patterns that are still recognizable in present-day California and New Mexico.<ref>{{harvp|Robinson|1979}}</ref>\n\n===The South===\n====Yucat\u00e1n====\nThe Yucat\u00e1n peninsula can be seen as a cul-de-sac,<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=3}}</ref> and it does indeed have unique features, but it also has strong similarities to other areas in the South. The Yucat\u00e1n peninsula extends into the Gulf of Mexico and was connected to Caribbean trade routes and Mexico City, far more than some other southern regions, such as Oaxaca.<ref name=\"Hunt_59_60\">{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=59\u201360}}</ref> There was three main Spanish settlements, the inland city of M\u00e9rida, where Spanish civil and religious officials had their headquarters and where the many Spaniards in the province lived. The ''villa'' of Campeche was the peninsula's port, the key gateway for the whole region. A merchant group developed and expanded dramatically as trade flourished during the seventeenth century.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=38\u201342}}</ref> Although that period was once characterized as New Spain's \"century of depression,\" for Yucat\u00e1n this was certainly not the case, with sustained growth from the early seventeenth century to the end of the colonial period.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=39, 59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nWith dense indigenous Maya populations, Yucat\u00e1n's [[encomienda]] system was established early and persisted far longer than in central Mexico, since fewer Spaniards migrated to the region than in the center.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Although Yucat\u00e1n was a more peripheral area to the colony, since it lacked rich mining areas and no agricultural or other export product, it did have complex of Spanish settlement, with a whole range of social types in the main settlements of M\u00e9rida and the villas of Campeche and Valladolid.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=33\u201351}}</ref> There was an important sector of mixed-race [[castas]], some of whom were fully at home in both the indigenous and Hispanic worlds. Blacks were an important component of Yucatecan society.<ref>{{harvp|Restall|2009}}</ref> The largest population in the province was indigenous Maya, who lived in their communities, but which were in contact with the Hispanic sphere via labor demands and commerce.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=42\u201346}}</ref>\n\nIn Yucat\u00e1n, Spanish rule was largely indirect, allowing these communities considerable political and cultural autonomy. The Maya community, the ''cah'', was the means by which indigenous cultural integrity was maintained. In the economic sphere, unlike many other regions and ethnic groups in Mesoamerica, the Yucatec Maya did not have a pre-conquest network of regular markets to exchange different types of food and craft goods. Perhaps because the peninsula was uniform in its ecosystem local niche production did not develop.<ref>{{harvp|Restall|1997|p=185}}</ref> Production of cotton textiles, largely by Maya women, helped pay households' tribute obligations, but basic crops were the basis of the economy. The cah retained considerable land under the control of religious brotherhoods or confraternities (''cofrad\u00edas''), the device by which Maya communities avoided colonial officials, the clergy, or even indigenous rulers (''gobernadores'') from diverting of community revenues in their ''cajas de comunidad'' (literally community-owned chests that had locks and keys). Cofrad\u00edas were traditionally lay pious organizations and burial societies, but in Yucat\u00e1n they became significant holders of land, a source of revenue for pious purposes kept under cah control. \"[I]n Yucat\u00e1n the cofrad\u00eda in its modified form was the community.\"<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=266}}</ref> Local Spanish clergy had no reason to object to the arrangement since much of the revenue went for payment for masses or other spiritual matters controlled by the priest.\n\nA limiting factor in Yucat\u00e1n's economy was the poorness of the limestone soil, which could only support crops for two to three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a limiting factor on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (''cenotes''), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had rights to land so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general, the Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish ''congregaci\u00f3n'' or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as mule and horse breeding, depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofrad\u00edas in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching.<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=267}}</ref> Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofrad\u00edas' cattle were used for direct aid to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=270}}</ref>\n\nIn the seventeenth century, patterns shifted in Yucat\u00e1n and Tabasco, as the English took territory the Spanish claimed but did not control, especially what became British Honduras (now Belize), where they cut dyewood and in Laguna de T\u00e9rminos (Isla del Carmen) where they cut logwood. In 1716\u201317 viceroy of New Spain organized a sufficient ships to expel the foreigners, where the crown subsequently built a fortress at Isla del Carmen.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=50\u201352}}</ref> But the British held onto their territory in the eastern portion of the peninsula into the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the enclave supplied guns to the rebellious Maya in the [[Caste War of Yucatan]].<ref>{{harvp|Reed|1964}}</ref>\n\n====Valley of Oaxaca====\n[[Image:SantoDomingo12-05Oaxaca109.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n (Oaxaca)|Church of Santo Domingo]], [[Oaxaca City]]]]\nSince [[Oaxaca]] was lacking in mineral deposits and it had an abundant sedentary indigenous population, its development was notable for the lack of European or mixed-race population, lack of large-scale Spanish haciendas, and the survival of indigenous communities. These communities retained their land, indigenous languages, and distinct ethnic identities. [[Antequera]] (now Oaxaca City) was a Spanish settlement founded in 1529, but the rest of Oaxaca consisted of indigenous towns. Despite its remoteness from Mexico City, \"throughout the colonial era, Oaxaca was one of Mexico's most prosperous provinces.\"<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|p=186}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Brian R.

Cochineal's commodity chain is an interesting one, with indigenous peasants in the remote areas of Oaxaca ultimately linked to Amsterdam and London commodity exchanges and the European production of luxury cloth.<ref>{{harvp|Marichal|2006}}</ref> The most extensive scholarly work on Oaxaca's eighteenth-century economy deals with the nexus between the local crown officials (alcaldes mayores), merchant investors (''aviadores''), the repartimiento (forced labor), and indigenous products, particularly cochineal. The rich, color-fast red dye produced from insects, was harvested from [[nopal cacti]]. Cochineal was a high-value, low-volume product that became the second-most valuable Mexican export after silver. Although it could be produced elsewhere in central and southern Mexico, its main region of production was Oaxaca. For the indigenous in Oaxaca, cochineal was the only one \"with which the [tributaries] maintain themselves and pay their debts\" but it also had other advantages for them.{{#tag:ref|Baskes suggests the crown restricted its production to Oaxaca until 1819, which likely contributed to artificially high prices.<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|p=185}}</ref>|group=Note}} Producing cochineal was time-consuming labor, but it was not particularly difficult and could be done by the elderly, women, and children.<ref>{{harvp|Chance|1989|p=121}}</ref> It was also important to households and communities because it initially did not require the indigenous to displace their existing crops or migrate elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the repartimiento has historically been seen as an imposition on the indigenous, forcing them into economic relations they would rather have avoided and maintained by force,<ref>For instance, {{harvp|Chance|1989|pp=121\u2013122}}.</ref> recent work on eighteenth-century Oaxaca analyzes the nexus of crown officials (the alcaldes mayores) and Spanish merchants, and indigenous via the repartimiento. cash loaned by local crown officials (the alcalde mayor and his teniente), usually to individual Indians but sometimes to communities, in exchange for a fixed amount of a good (cochineal or cotton mantles) at a later date. Indigenous elites were an integral part of the repartimiento, often being recipients of large extensions of credit. As authority figures in their community, they were in a good position to collect on the debt, the most risky part of the business from the Spanish point of view.\n\n====Tehuantepec====\nThe Isthmus of [[Tehuantepec]] region of Oaxaca was important for its short transit between the Gulf Coast and the Pacific, facilitating both overland and sea trade. The province of Tehuantepec was the Pacific side of the isthmus and the headwaters of the Coatzacoalcos River.<ref name=\"Gerhard_264\">{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=264}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] acquired strategically located holdings entailed in the Marquesado including Huatulco,{{#tag:ref|The crown did not wish to have the main west coast port in private hands and an agreement was worked out with Cort\u00e9s heir, Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, to relinquish the Tehuantepec encomienda.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=265}}.</ref>|group=Note}} once the main Pacific Coast port before [[Acapulco]] replaced it in 1563.\n\nGold mining was an early draw for Spaniards, who directed indigenous labor to its extraction, but did not continue beyond the mid-sixteenth century. Over the long run, ranching and commerce were the most important economic activities, with the settlement of Tehuantepec becoming the hub. The region's history can be divided into three distinct periods, an initial period of engagement with Spanish colonial rule to 1563, during which there was a working relationship with the Zapotec ruling line and the establishment of Cort\u00e9s's economic enterprises. This early period came to a close with the death of the last native king in 1562 and the escheatment of Cort\u00e9s's Tehuantepec encomiendas to the crown in 1563. The second period of approximately a century (1563\u20131660) saw the decline of the indigenous entailed estate (''cacicazgo'') and indigenous political power and development of the colonial economy and imposition of Spanish political and religious structures. The final period is the maturation of these structures (1660\u20131750). The 1660 rebellion can be a dividing line between the two later periods.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|2005|pp=xiv\u2013xv}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of [[Tehuantepec]], the largest settlement on the isthmus, was an important prehispanic Zapotec trade and religious center, which was not under the jurisdiction of the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Gerhard_264\"/> The early colonial history of Tehuantepec and the larger province was dominated by Cort\u00e9s and the Marquesado, but the crown realized the importance of the area and concluded an agreement in 1563 with the second Marqu\u00e9s by which the crown took control of the Tehuantepec encomienda. The Marquesado continued to have major private holdings in the province. The Villa of Tehuantepec became a center of Spanish and mixed-race settlement, crown administration, and trade.\n\nThe Cort\u00e9s haciendas in Tehuantepec were key components of the province's economy, and they were directly linked to other Marquesado enterprises in greater Mexico in an integrated fashion.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989}}</ref> The Dominicans also had significant holdings in Tehuantepec, but there has been little research on these. However important the Marquesado and the Dominican enterprises were, there were also other economic players in the region, including individual Spaniards as well as existing indigenous communities. Ranching emerged as the dominant rural enterprise in most of Tehuantepec with a ranching boom in the period 1580\u20131640. Since Tehuantepec experienced significant indigenous population loss in the sixteenth century conforming to the general pattern, ranching made possible for Spaniards to thrive in Tehuantepec because ranching was not dependent on significant amounts of indigenous labor.<ref name=\"Zeitlin_1989\">{{harvp|Zeitlin|1989}}</ref>\n\nThe most detailed economic records for the region are of the Marquesado's ranching haciendas, which produced draft animals (horses, mules, burros, and oxen) and sheep and goats, for meat and wool. Cattle ranching for meat, tallow, and leather were also important. Tallow for candles used in churches and residences and leather used in a variety of ways (saddles, other tack, boots, furniture, machinery) were significant items in the larger colonial economy, finding markets well beyond Tehuantepec. Since the Marquesado operated as an integrated enterprise, draft animals were used in other holdings for transport, agriculture, and mining in Oaxaca, Morelos, Toluca, and Mexico City as well as sold. Raised in Tehuantepec, the animals were driven to other Marquesado holdings for use and distribution.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=9}}</ref>\n\nAlthough colonial population decline affected the indigenous in Tehuantepec, their communities remained important in the colonial era and remain distinctly Indian to the current era. There were differences in the three distinct linguistic and ethnic groups in colonial Tehuantepec, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], the [[Zoque people|Zoque]], and the [[Huave]]. The Zapotecs concluded an alliance with the Spaniards at contact, and they had already expanded their territory into Zoque and Huave regions.\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the Zapotecs not only survived, but flourished, unlike the other two. They continued to pursue agriculture, some of it irrigated, which was not disrupted by the growing ranching economy. Generally Zapotec elites protected their communities from Spanish incursions and community cohesion remained strong as shown in members' performance of regular community service for social ends. Zapotec elites engaged in the market economy early on, which undermined to an extent the bonds between commoners and elites who colluded with the Spanish. In contrast to the Zapotecs, the Zoque generally declined as a group during the ranching boom, with interloping animals eating their maize crops. Zoque response was to take up being vaqueros themselves. They had access to the trade to Guatemala. Of the three indigenous groups, the Huave were the most isolated from the Spanish ranching economy and labor demands.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|1989|p=55}}</ref> With little arable or grazing land, they exploited the lagoons of the Pacific coast, using shore and beach resources. They traded dried shrimp and fish, as well as purple dye from shells to Oaxaca, likely acquiring foodstuffs that they were unable to cultivate themselves.<ref name=\"Zeitlin_1989\"/>\n\nNot well documented is the number of African slaves and their descendants, who were artisans in urban areas and did hard manual labor in rural areas.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=15}}</ref> In a pattern recognizable elsewhere, coastal populations were mainly African, including an unknown number of [[cimarr\u00f3nes|cimarr\u00f3n]] (runaway slave) settlements, while inland the indigenous communities were more prominent. On the Cort\u00e9s haciendas, blacks and mulattoes were essential to the profitability of the enterprises.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=16}}</ref>\n\nIn general, Tehuantepec was not a site of major historical events, but in 1660\u201361, there was a significant rebellion stemming from increased repartimiento Spanish demands.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|2005|loc=esp. Chapter 5}}</ref>\n\n====Central America====\n{{Main|Captaincy General of Guatemala}}\n[[File:Santa Catalina Arch - Antigua Guatemala Feb 2020.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arco de Santa Catalina]], [[Antigua Guatemala]]]]\nWith the growth of a sufficient Spanish population and the crown's desire to better govern the area, it established the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], which had primary jurisdiction over what are now Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The region was diverse, and outlying provinces were resentful for elites in capital of [[Antigua Guatemala]], destroyed by an earthquake in 1773. There was a high court [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in the Kingdom of Guatemala. Given the region's distance from major centers of power in New Spain and Spain itself, local strongmen in the early were only nominally subject to royal authority. The indigenous population was very large in comparison to the Spanish, and there were relatively few Africans. Spaniards continued to employ forced labor in the region starting with the conquest era and exact tribute from the indigenous.<ref>Sherman, William L. ''Forced Native Labor in Sixteenth-Century Central America''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1979.</ref> Compared to the mining areas of New Spain's North, this region was generally poor in mineral resources, although Honduras had a brief boom in gold mining, and in the colonial period had little potential to develop an export product, except for [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and the blue dye [[indigo]].<ref>[[Murdo J. MacLeod|MacLeod, Murdo J.]], ''Spanish Central America: A Socioeconomic History, 1520\u20131720''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1973.</ref> Cacao had been cultivated in the prehispanic period. Orchards of cacao trees, which took a number of years to come to maturity and produce fruit. Cacao boomed in the late sixteenth century, and then was displaced by indigo as the most important export product.  Indigo, like cacao, was native to the region, and the indigenous peoples gathered wild indigo, used for dying cloth and as a trade good. After the arrival of the Spanish, they domesticated indigo and created plantations for its cultivation in Yucatan, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The indigo industry thrived, since there was high demand in Europe for a high quality, color-fast blue dye. In the region, cultivation and processing was done by indigenous workers, but the owners of plantations, ''a\u00f1ileros'', were Spanish. It was a dangerous work environment, with toxins present in the indigo plants that sickened and sometimes killed workers. It was profitable, especially following the [[Bourbon Reforms]], which allowed trade within the Spanish empire. In the late eighteenth century, indigo growers organized in a trade organization, the ''Consulado de Comercio''.<ref>Woodward, Ralph Lee. ''Class Privilege and Economic Development: The Consulado de Comercio of Guatemala, 1793\u20131871''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1966.</ref> There were regions that were not subjugated to Spanish rule, such as the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] and the [[Mosquito Coast]], and the English took advantage of weak Spanish control to establish a commercial presence on the Gulf Coast, later seizing [[Belize]]. An American-born Spanish elite (''criollos'') accumulated land and built fortunes on wheat, sugar, and cattle, all of which were consumed within the region.<ref>Webre, Stephen. \"Audiencia of Guatemala\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3, pp.130\u201331. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===The role of epidemics===\n[[File:FlorentineCodex BK12 F54 smallpox.jpg|thumb|right|Nahua depiction of [[smallpox]], Book XII on the conquest of Mexico in the [[Florentine Codex]] (1576)]]\nSpanish settlers brought to the American continent [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], and other infectious diseases. Most of the Spanish settlers had developed an immunity to these diseases from childhood, but the indigenous peoples lacked the needed [[antibodies]] since these diseases were totally alien to the native population at the time. There were at least three separate, major epidemics that decimated the population: smallpox (1520 to 1521), measles (1545 to 1548) and typhus (1576 to 1581). In the course of the 16th century, the native population in Mexico went from an estimated pre-Columbian population of 8 to 20 million to less than two million. Therefore, at the start of the 17th century, continental New Spain was a depopulated country with abandoned cities and [[maize]] fields. These diseases would not affect the Philippines in the same way because the diseases were already present in the country; Pre-Hispanic Filipinos had contact with other foreign nationalities before the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\n===The role of interracial mixing===\n{{Main|Casta}}\n[[File:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Indian woman, Mestiza. [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], Mexico 1763.]]\n[[File:Castas 04mulata max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Black woman, [[Mulatto]]. Miguel Cabrera.]]\nFollowing the Spanish conquests, new labels for racial categories were created, primary among them the [[Mestizo]], the offspring of a Spaniard and an ''India''. The Mestizo population emerged as a result of the Spanish colonizers having children with indigenous women, both within and outside of wedlock, which brought about the mixing of both cultures.\n\nInitially, if a child was born in wedlock, the child was considered, and raised as, a member of the prominent parent's ethnicity. (''See [[Hyperdescent]] and [[Hypodescent]].'') Because of this, the term \"Mestizo\" was associated with illegitimacy. Mestizos do not appear in large numbers in official censuses until the second half of the 17th century, when a sizable and stable community of mixed-race people with no claims to being either Indian or Spanish appeared, although, of course, a large population of biological Mestizos had already existed for over a century in Mexico.\n\nThe Spanish conquest also brought the migration of people of African descent to the many regions of the Viceroyalty. Some came as [[Juan Garrido|free blacks]], but vast majority came because of the introduction of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]]. As the native population was decimated by epidemics and forced labor, black slaves were imported. Mixes with Europeans and indigenous peoples also occurred, resulting in the creation of new racial categories such as [[Mulatto]]s and [[Zambo]]s to account for these offspring. As with the term Mestizo, these other terms were associated with illegitimacy, since a majority\u2014though not all\u2014of these people were born outside of wedlock.\n\nEventually a [[caste]] system was created to describe the various mixes and to assign them a different social level. In theory, each different mix had a name and different sets of privileges or prohibitions. In reality, mixed-race people were able to negotiate various racial and ethnic identities (often several ones at different points in their lives) depending on the family ties and wealth they had. In its general outline, the system reflected reality. The upper echelons of government were staffed by Spaniards born in Spain (''[[peninsulares]]''), the middle and lower levels of government and other higher paying jobs were held by [[Criollo (people)|Criollo]]s (Criollos were Spaniards born in the Americas, or\u2014as permitted by the ''casta'' system\u2014Spaniards with some [[Amerindian]] or even other ancestry.)<ref>{{harvp|Carrera|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> The best lands were owned by Peninsulares and Criollos, with Native communities for the most part relegated to marginal lands. Mestizos and Mulattos held [[artisan]]al positions and unskilled laborers were either more mixed people, such as [[Zambo]]s, recently freed slaves or Natives who had left their communities and settled in areas with large [[Hispanic]] populations. Native populations tended to have their own legally recognized communities (the ''rep\u00fablicas de indios'') with their own social and economic hierarchies. This rough sketch must be complicated by the fact that not only did exceptions exist, but also that all these \"racial\" categories represented social conventions, as demonstrated by the fact that many persons were assigned a caste based on hyperdescent or hypodescent.\n\nEven if mixes were common, the white population tried to keep their higher status, and were largely successful in doing so. With Mexican and Central American independence, the caste system and slavery were theoretically abolished. However, historians have noted that the Criollos simply replaced the [[Peninsulares]] in terms of power and \"ethnic inequality\" in Mexico continued in the post-independence period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Identity and Activism|last=Linares|first=Federico Navarette|publisher=Shipra Publications|year=2009|location=New Delhi|pages=55\u201356|chapter=Crisis and Reinvention: The Redefinition of Indigenous Identities in Contemporary Mexico}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexico and the United States|last=Campbell|first=Andrew|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corp|year=2002|isbn=9780761474036|editor-last=Stacy|editor-first=Lee|pages=245\u2013246}}</ref> As a result of \"mestizaje\" and [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenista]] policies implemented by the Mexican government in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, \"Mestizo\" soon became a cultural term meant to homogenize the Mexican population, including everyone from Indigenous people who had been [[Detribalization|detribalized]] or abandoned their traditional ways, to \"westernized urban elites, traditional peasant communities, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Atheists, and the widely varying regional cultures of Mexico.\" As such, the term has been criticized as \"problematic,\" since it has been noted that \"the only trait shared by all Mestizos is the fact that they do not consider themselves Indians.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Identity and Activism|last=Linares|first=Federico Navarette|publisher=Shipra Publications|year=2009|location=New Delhi|pages=61|chapter=Crisis and Reinvention: The Redefinition of Indigenous Identities in Contemporary Mexico}}</ref>\n\n===Population in early 1800s===\n[[File:Mapa del Virreinato de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (1819).svg|thumb|upright=1.5|New Spain in 1819 with the boundaries established at the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]]]]\nWhile different intendencies would perform censuses to get a detailed insight in regards to its inhabitants (namely occupation, number of persons per household, ethnicity etc.), it was until 1793 that the results of the first ever national census would be published. The census is also known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" because its creation was ordered by the Count of the same name. Most of the census' original datasets have reportedly been lost; thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for the total population, ranging from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354<ref>{{harvp|Navarro y Noriega|1820}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|von Humboldt|1811}}</ref> (more recent data suggests that the actual population of New Spain in 1810 was closer to 5 or 5.5 million individuals)<ref>{{harvp|McCaa|2000}}</ref> as well as the ethnic composition in the country although there isn't much variation, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%\u201317% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.<ref name=\"Lerner1968\">{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Victoria|title=Consideraciones sobre la poblaci\u00f3n de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a: 1793\u20131810, seg\u00fan Humboldt y Navarro y Noriega|trans-title=Considerations on the population of New Spain: 1793\u20131810, according to Humboldt and Navarro and Noriega|language=es|url=http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf|year=1968|pages=328\u2013348|accessdate=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104825/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf|archive-date=31 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Intendecy/territory\n!European population (%)\n!Indigenous population (%)\n!Mestizo population (%)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[State of Mexico|M\u00e9xico]] (only [[State of Mexico]] and capital)\n| 16.9%\n| 66.1%\n| 16.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Puebla]]\n| 10.1%\n| 74.3%\n| 15.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Oaxaca]]\n| 06.3%\n| 88.2%\n| 05.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guanajuato]]\n| 25.8%\n| 44.0%\n| 29.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n| 13.0%\n| 51.2%\n| 35.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Zacatecas]]\n| 15.8%\n| 29.0%\n| 55.1%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Durango]]\n| 20.2%\n| 36.0%\n| 43.5%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Sonora]]\n| 28.5%\n| 44.9%\n| 26.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Yucat\u00e1n]]\n| 14.8%\n| 72.6%\n| 12.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guadalajara]]\n| 31.7%\n| 33.3%\n| 34.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Veracruz]]\n| 10.4%\n| 74.0%\n| 15.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Michoacan|Valladolid]]\n| 27.6%\n| 42.5%\n| 29.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[New Mexico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]\n|  ~\n| 30.8%\n| 69.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Baja California|Vieja California]]\n|  ~\n| 51.7%\n| 47.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Alta California|Nueva California]]\n|   ~\n| 89.9%\n| 09.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Coahuila]]\n| 30.9%\n| 28.9%\n| 40.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n| 62.6%\n| 05.5%\n| 31.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Santander]]\n| 25.8%\n| 23.3%\n| 50.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Texas]]\n| 39.7%\n| 27.3%\n| 32.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Tlaxcala]]\n| 13.6%\n| 72.4%\n| 13.8%\n|-\n|}\n~<small>Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.</small>\n\nRegardless of the possible imprecision related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''.

Some of the most important early buildings in New Spain were churches and other religious architecture. Civil architecture included the viceregal palace, now the National Palace, and the Mexico City town council (''cabildo''), both located on the main square in the capital.\n\nThe [[House of the First Print Shop in the Americas|first printing press in the New World]] was brought to Mexico in 1539, by printer [[Juan Pablos]] (Giovanni Paoli). The first book printed in Mexico was entitled \"''La escala espiritual de San Juan Cl\u00edmaco''\".

It covered a huge area that included territories in [[North America]], [[South America]], [[Asia]] and [[Oceania]].\nIt originated in 1521 after the [[fall of Tenochtitlan]], the main event of the Spanish conquest, which did not properly end until much later, as its territory continued to grow to the north. It was officially created on 18 August 1521 as a [[Monarchy|Kingdom]] (Spanish: ''reino''), the first of [[Viceroyalty#Spain|four viceroyalties Spain created in the Americas]]. Its first [[viceroy]] was [[Antonio de Mendoza y Pacheco]], and the capital of the kingdom was [[Mexico City]], established on the ancient [[Tenochtitlan]].\n\nIt included what is now [[Mexico]] plus the current U.S. states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Florida]] and parts of [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]; as well as the southwestern part of [[British Columbia]] of present-day [[Canada]]; plus the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] (which included the current countries of [[Guatemala]], the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]]); the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] (current [[Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]]); and the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] (including the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], the [[Caroline Islands]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and the short lived [[Spanish Formosa]] in modern-day northern [[Taiwan]], as well as during a century the island of [[Tidore]] and the briefly occupied [[Sultanate of Ternate]], both in modern-day [[Indonesia]]).\n\nOther kingdoms of the Spanish Empire bordered New Spain and were given the right of appeal to the most senior representative of the [[King of Spain|king]]. These kingdoms were independent of New Spain (separate from New Spain itself): [[Nueva Galicia]] (1530); [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] (1540); [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] (1562); [[New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]] (1569); [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] (1598); [[Nueva Extremadura]] (1674) and [[Nuevo Santander]] (1746).\n\nNew Spain proper was itself organized in [[Captaincy general|captaincies general]]. There were four captaincies: Captaincy General of the Philippines (1574), Captaincy General of Cuba, [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico]] and [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo]]. These independent kingdoms and territorial subdivisions each had their own governor and captain generals (who in New Spain was the viceroy himself, who added this title to his other dignities). In Guatemala, Santo Domingo and Nueva Galicia, these officials were called presiding governors, since they were leading royal audiences. For this reason, these hearings were considered \"praetorial.\"\n\nThere were two great estates in America. The most important was the [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marquisate of the Valley]] of [[Oaxaca]], property of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and his descendants that included a set of vast territories where marquises had civil and criminal jurisdiction, and the right to grant land, water and forests and within which were their main possessions (cattle ranches, agricultural work, sugar mills, fulling houses and shipyards). The other estate was the Duchy of [[Atlixco]], granted in 1708, by [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]] to [[Jos\u00e9 Sarmiento de Valladares, 1st Duke of Atrisco|Jos\u00e9 Sarmiento de Valladares]], former viceroy of New Spain and married to the Countess of Moctezuma, with civil and criminal jurisdiction over Atlixco, [[Tepeaca]], [[Guachinango, Jalisco|Guachinango]], Ixtepeji and Tula de Allende. Another important Marquisate was the [[Sebastian Elcano|Marquisate of Buglas]] in Negros Island at the Philippines which was awarded to the descendants of Sebastian Elcano and his crew, the first to circumnavigate the world. [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] introduced reforms in the organization of the viceroyalty in 1786, known as [[Bourbon reforms]], which created the [[intendent|intendencias]], which allowed to limit, in some way, the viceroy's attributions.\n\nNew Spain developed highly regional divisions, reflecting the impact of climate, topography, indigenous populations, and mineral resources. The areas of central and southern Mexico had dense indigenous populations with complex social, political, and economic organization. The northern area of Mexico, a region of nomadic and semi-nomadic indigenous populations, was not generally conducive to dense settlements, but the discovery of [[silver]] in [[Zacatecas]] in the 1540s drew settlement there to exploit the mines. Silver mining not only became the engine of the economy of New Spain, but vastly enriched Spain and transformed the global economy. New Spain was the New World terminus of the Philippine trade, making the kingdom a vital link between Spain's New World empire and [[Spanish East Indies|its Asian empire]].\n\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, the kingdom fell into crisis, aggravated by the [[Peninsular War]], and its direct consequence in the kingdom, the political crisis in Mexico in 1808, which ended with the government of Viceroy [[Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray]] and, later, gave rise to the Conspiracy of Valladolid and the Conspiracy of Quer\u00e9taro. This last one was the direct antecedent of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], which, when concluding in 1821, disintegrated the viceroyalty and gave way to the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], in which finally [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] would be crowned.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Viceroyalty of New Spain and its relationship to the crown==\nThe [[Kingdom of New Spain]] was established following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] in 1521 as a New World kingdom dependent on the [[Crown of Castile]], since the initial funds for exploration came from [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{harvp|Haring|1947|pp=7, 105}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Liss|1975|p=33}}</ref> Although New Spain was a dependency of Castile, it was a kingdom not a colony, subject to the presiding monarch on the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Haring_7\">{{harvp|Haring|1947|p=7}}</ref><ref>Mark A.

To the east of the continent, it included the [[Spanish West Indies]] ([[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (comprising the modern states of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), [[Puerto Rico]], [[Jamaica]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Trinidad]], and the [[Bay Islands (department)|Bay Islands]]).\n\n[[File:Spanish North America.png|thumb|Spanish historical presence, claimed territories, points of interest and expeditions in North America.]]\n\nUntil the 18th century, when Spain saw its claims in North America threatened by other European powers, much of what were called the Spanish borderlands consisted of territory now part of the United States. This was not occupied by many Spanish settlers and was considered more marginal to Spanish interests than the most densely populated and lucrative areas of central Mexico. To shore up its claims in North America, starting in the late 18th century [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] explored and claimed the coast of what is now British Columbia and Alaska. On the mainland, the administrative units included [[Las Californias]], that is, the Baja California peninsula, still part of Mexico and divided into [[Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]; [[Alta California]] (present-day [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]], and southern [[Wyoming]]); (from the 1760s) [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] (including the western Mississippi River basin and the Missouri River basin); [[Nueva Extremadura]] (the present-day states of [[Coahuila]] and [[Texas]]); and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] (parts of [[Texas]] and [[New Mexico]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/412085/Viceroyalty-of-New-Spain |title=Viceroyalty of New Spain (historical territory, Mexico) |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Conquest era (1521\u20131535)===\n{{See also|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|History of Mexico City}}\nThe Caribbean islands and early Spanish explorations around the circum-Caribbean region had not been of major political, strategic, or financial importance until the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] in 1521. However, important precedents of exploration, conquest, and settlement and crown rule had been initially worked out in the Caribbean, which long affected subsequent regions, including Mexico and Peru.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=61\u201385}}</ref> The indigenous societies of [[Mesoamerica]] brought under Spanish control were of unprecedented complexity and wealth from what they had encountered in the Caribbean. This presented both an important opportunity and a potential threat to the power of the [[Crown of Castile]], since the conquerors were acting independent of effective crown control. The societies could provide the [[conquistador]]s, especially [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], a base from which the conquerors could become autonomous, or even independent, of the Crown.\n\nAs a result, the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King of Spain, Charles V]] created the [[Council of the Indies]]{{#tag:ref|The Spanish called their overseas empire \"the Indies\" until the end of its empire, a remnant of Columbus's assertion that he had reached the Far East, rather than a New World.|group=Note}} in 1524 as the crown entity to oversee the crown's interests in the New World. Since the time of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], central Iberia was governed through councils appointed by the monarch with particular jurisdictions. Thus, the creation of the Council of the Indies became another, but extremely important, advisory body to the monarch.\n\nThe crown had set up the [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]] (House of Trade) in 1503 to regulate contacts between Spain and its overseas possessions. A key function was to gather information about navigation to make trips less risky and more efficient. Philip II sought systematic information about his overseas empire and mandated reports, known as the [[Relaciones geogr\u00e1ficas]], with text on topography, economic conditions, and populations among other information. They were accompanied by maps of the area discussed, many of which were drawn by indigenous artists.<ref>Howard F.

An earlier [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Audiencia]] had been established in [[Santo Domingo]] in 1526 to deal with the Caribbean settlements. That court, housed in the [[Museo de las Casas Reales|Casa Reales]] in Santo Domingo, was charged with encouraging further exploration and settlements with the authority granted it by the crown. Management by the Audiencia, which was expected to make executive decisions as a body, proved unwieldy. Therefore, in 1535, King Charles V named Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] as the first [[Viceroy of New Spain]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1532 opened up the vast territories of [[South America]] to further conquests, the [[Monarchy of Spain|Crown]] established an independent [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] there in 1542.\n\n===Evangelization===\n{{Main|History of Roman Catholicism in Mexico}}\nBecause the [[Roman Catholic Church]] had played such an important role in the ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Christian reconquest) of the [[Iberian peninsula]] from the [[Moors]], the Church in essence became another arm of the Spanish government. The Spanish Crown granted it a large role in the administration of the state, and this practice became even more pronounced in the New World, where prelates often assumed the role of government officials. In addition to the Church's explicit political role, the Catholic faith became a central part of Spanish identity after the conquest of last Muslim kingdom in the peninsula, the [[Emirate of Granada]], and the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of all Jews]] who did not convert to Christianity.\n\nThe [[conquistador]]s brought with them many missionaries to promulgate the Catholic religion. Amerindians were taught the Roman Catholic religion and the language of Spain. Initially, the missionaries hoped to create a large body of Amerindian priests, but this did not come to be. Moreover, efforts were made to keep the Amerindian cultural aspects that did not violate the Catholic traditions. As an example, most Spanish priests committed themselves to learn the most important Amerindian languages (especially during the 16th century) and wrote grammars so that the missionaries could learn the languages and preach in them. This was similarly practiced by the French colonists.\n\nAt first, conversion seemed to be happening rapidly. The missionaries soon found that most of the natives had simply adopted \"the god of the heavens,\" as they called the Christian god,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} as just another one of their many gods.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} While they often held the Christian god to be an important deity because it was the god of the victorious conquerors, they did not see the need to abandon their old beliefs. As a result, a second wave of missionaries began an effort to completely erase the old beliefs, which they associated with the ritualized [[human sacrifice]] found in many of the native religions, eventually putting an end to this practice common before the arrival of the Spaniards. In the process many artifacts of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of native [[codex|codices]] were burned, native priests and teachers were persecuted, and the temples and statues of the old gods were torn down. Even some foods associated with the native religions, like [[amaranth]], were forbidden.\n\nMany clerics, such as [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]], also tried to protect the natives from ''de facto'' and actual enslavement to the settlers, and obtained from the Crown decrees and promises to protect native Mesoamericans, most notably the [[New Laws]]. Unfortunately, the royal government was too far away to fully enforce them, and many abuses against the natives, even among the clergy, continued. Eventually, the Crown declared the natives to be [[Ward (law)|legal minors]] and placed under the guardianship of the Crown, which was responsible for their indoctrination. It was this status that barred the native population from the priesthood. During the following centuries, under Spanish rule, a new culture developed that combined the customs and traditions of the indigenous peoples with that of Catholic Spain. Numerous churches and other buildings were constructed by native labor in the Spanish style, and cities were named after various saints or religious topics such as [[San Luis Potos\u00ed, San Luis Potos\u00ed|San Luis Potos\u00ed]] (after [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]]) and [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]] (the [[True Cross]]).\n\nThe [[Spanish Inquisition]], and its New Spanish counterpart, the [[Mexican Inquisition]], continued to operate in the viceroyalty until Mexico declared its independence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Inquisition worked with the viceregal government to block the diffusion of [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as well as the revolutionary republican and democratic ideas of the [[United States War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]].\n\n===Founding Spanish cities, early sixteenth century===\n{{main|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ruscelli Nueva Hispania Tabula Nova 1561 UTA.jpg|thumb|Girolamo Ruscelli's 1561 map of New Spain, ''Nueva Hispania Tabula Nova'']]\n\nEven before the establishment of the viceroyalty of New Spain, conquerors in central Mexico founded new Spanish cities and embarked on further conquests, a pattern that had been established in the Caribbean.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=61\u201371}}</ref> In central Mexico, the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]] was transformed into the main settlement of the territory; thus, the [[history of Mexico City]] is of huge importance to the whole colonial enterprise. Spaniards founded new settlements in [[Puebla de los Angeles]] (founded 1531) at the midway point between the Mexico City (founded 1521\u201324) and the Caribbean port of [[Veracruz]] (1519). Colima (1524), [[Oaxaca City|Antequera]] (1526, now Oaxaca City), and [[Guadalajara]] (1532) were all new Spanish settlements. North of Mexico City, the city of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] was founded (ca. 1531) in what was called the [[Baj\u00edo]], a major zone of commercial agriculture. Guadalajara was founded northwest of Mexico City (1531\u201342) and became the dominant Spanish settlement in the region. West of Mexico City the settlement of Valladolid (Michoacan) was founded (1529\u201341). In the densely indigenous South, as noted, Antequera (1526) became the center of Spanish settlement in Oaxaca; [[Santiago de Guatemala]] was founded in 1524; and in Yucat\u00e1n, [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n|M\u00e9rida]] (1542) was founded inland, with [[Campeche]] founded as a small, Caribbean port in 1541. There was sea trade between Campeche and Veracruz.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|loc=p. 86, map. 4}}</ref> During the first twenty years, before the establishment of the viceroyalty, some of the important cities of the colonial era that remain important today were founded. The discovery of silver in Zacatecas in the far north was a transformative event. The settlement of [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] was founded in 1547 deep in the territory of the nomadic and fierce [[Chichimeca]], whose resistance to Spanish presence was the protracted conflict of the [[Chichimeca War]].<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|Schwartz|1983|pp=86\u201392}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|pp=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\n===Later expansion===\n{{See also|Spanish missions in California|Spanish missions in Arizona|Spanish missions in Texas|Spanish missions in New Mexico|Presidio#Mexico}}\n[[File:Coronado-Remington.jpg|thumb|\"V\u00e1zquez de Coronado Sets Out to the North\" (1540), by [[Frederic Remington]], oil on canvas, 1905]]\n\nDuring the 16th century, many Spanish cities were established in North and Central America. Spain attempted to establish missions in what is now the [[southern United States]] including [[Spanish missions in Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Spanish missions in the Carolinas|South Carolina]] between 1568 and 1587. These efforts were mainly successful in the region of present-day [[Florida]], where the city of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was founded in 1565, the oldest European city in the United States.\n\nUpon his arrival, Viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza vigorously took to the duties entrusted to him by the King and encouraged the exploration of Spain's new mainland territories. He commissioned the expeditions of [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] into the present day [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] in 1540\u20131542. The Viceroy commissioned [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] in the first Spanish exploration up the [[Pacific Ocean]] in 1542\u20131543. Cabrillo sailed far up the coast, becoming the first European to see present day California, United States. The Viceroy also sent [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] to the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1542\u20131543. As these new territories became controlled, they were brought under the purview of the Viceroy of New Spain. Spanish settlers expanded to Nuevo Mexico, and the major settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was founded in 1610.\n\nThe establishment of religious missions and military presidios on the northern frontier became the nucleus of Spanish settlement and the founding of Spanish towns.\n\n===Expansion to the Philippine Islands and the Manila trade===\n\n{{Main|History of the Philippines}}\nSeeking to develop trade between the [[East Indies]] and the [[Americas]] across the Pacific Ocean, [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] established the first Spanish settlement in the Philippine Islands in 1565, which became the town of ''San Miguel'' (present-day [[Cebu City]]). [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] discovered an efficient sailing route from the Philippine Islands to Mexico which took advantage of the [[Kuroshio Current]]. In 1571, the city of [[Manila]] became the capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]], with trade soon beginning via the [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco Galleons]]. The Manila-Acapulco trade route shipped products such as silk, spices, silver, porcelain and gold to the Americas from Asia.<ref>William Schurz, ''The Manila Galleon''.

Later they were traded across [[Europe]].\n\n===Spanish ocean trade routes and defense===\n{{Main|Spanish treasure fleet|Manila galleon}}\nThe Spanish crown created a system of convoys of ships (called the ''flota'') to prevent attacks by European [[privateer]]s. Some isolated attacks on these shipments took place in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] by English and Dutch pirates and privateers. One such act of piracy was led by [[Francis Drake]] in 1586, and another by [[Thomas Cavendish]] in 1587. In one episode, the cities of [[Huatulco]] (Oaxaca) and [[Barra de Navidad]] in [[Jalisco]] Province of M\u00e9xico were sacked. However, these maritime routes, both across the Pacific and the Atlantic, were successful in the defensive and logistical role they played in the history of the [[Spanish Empire]]. For over three centuries the [[Spanish Navy]] escorted the galleon convoys that sailed around the world.\n\nDon [[Lope D\u00edez de Armend\u00e1riz]], born in Quito, Ecuador, was the first Viceroy of New Spain who was born in the '[[New World]]'. He formed the 'Navy of Barlovento' ''(Armada de Barlovento)'', based in Veracruz, to patrol coastal regions and protect the [[harbor]]s, port towns, and trade ships from [[piracy|pirates]] and [[privateers]].\n\n===Indigenous revolts===\n[[File:Xochipilla.jpg|thumb|Viceroy don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] and [[Tlaxcalan]] Indians battle with the Caxcanes in the [[Mixt\u00f3n war]], 1541\u201342 in Nueva Galicia.]]\n\nAfter the conquest of central Mexico, there were only two major Indian revolts challenging Spanish rule. In the [[Mixt\u00f3n war]] in 1541, the viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] led an army against an uprising by [[Caxcan]]es. In the 1680 [[Pueblo revolt]], Indians in 24 settlements in New Mexico expelled the Spanish, who left for Texas, an exile lasting a decade. The [[Chichimeca war]] lasted over fifty years, 1550\u20131606, between the Spanish and various indigenous groups of northern New Spain, particularly in silver mining regions and the transportation trunk lines.<ref>Philip Wayne Powell, ''Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550\u20131600''.

It was a multiethnic revolt sparked by religious issues in several communities.<ref>Victoria Reifler Bricker, ''The Indian Christ, the Indian King: The Historical Substrate of Maya Myth and Ritual''.

In New Spain these grants were modeled after the tribute and [[corvee]] labor that the [[Mexica]] rulers had demanded from native communities. This system came to signify the oppression and exploitation of natives, although its originators may not have set out with such intent. In short order the upper echelons of patrons and priests in the society lived off the work of the lower classes. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the indigenous peoples, Bishop [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] suggested bringing black slaves to replace them. Fray Bartolom\u00e9 later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.\n\nIn Peru, the other discovery that perpetuated the system of forced labor, the [[mit'a]], was the enormously rich single silver mine discovered at Potos\u00ed, but in New Spain, labor recruitment differed significantly. With the exception of silver mines worked in the Aztec period at [[Taxco]], southwest of Tenochtitlan, the Mexico's mining region was outside the area of dense indigenous settlement. Labor for the mines in the north of Mexico had a workforce of black slave labor and indigenous wage labor, not draft labor.<ref name=\"Altman_etal_172\">{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=172}}</ref> Indigenous who were drawn to the mining areas were from different regions of the center of Mexico, with a few from the north itself. With such diversity they did not have a common ethnic identity or language and rapidly assimilated to Hispanic culture. Although mining was difficult and dangerous, the wages were good, which is what drew the indigenous labor.<ref name=\"Altman_etal_172\"/>\n\nThe Viceroyalty of New Spain was the principal source of income for Spain in the eighteenth century, with the revival of mining under the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. Important mining centers like [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]] and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] had been established in the sixteenth century and suffered decline for a variety of reasons in the seventeenth century, but silver mining in Mexico out performed all other Spanish overseas territories in revenues for the royal coffers.\n\nThe fast red [[dye]] [[cochineal]] was an important export in areas such as central Mexico and Oaxaca in terms of revenues to the crown and stimulation of the internal market of New Spain. ''[[Chocolate|Cacao]]'' and [[indigo]] were also important exports for the New Spain, but was used through rather the vice royalties rather than contact with European countries due to piracy, and smuggling.<ref name=\"Foster_101_103\">{{harvp|Foster|2000|pp=101\u2013103}}</ref> The indigo industry in particular also helped to temporarily unite communities throughout the [[Kingdom of Guatemala]] due to the smuggling.<ref name=\"Foster_101_103\"/>\n\nThere were two major ports in New Spain, [[Veracruz]] the viceroyalty's principal port on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Acapulco]] on the Pacific, terminus of the [[Manila Galleon]]. In the Philippines [[Manila]] near the [[South China Sea]] was the main port. The ports were fundamental for overseas trade, stretching a trade route from Asia, through the [[Manila Galleon]] to the Spanish mainland.\n\nThese were ships that made voyages from the Philippines to Mexico, whose goods were then transported overland from Acapulco to Veracruz and later reshipped from Veracruz to [[C\u00e1diz]] in Spain. So then, the ships that set sail from Veracruz were generally loaded with merchandise from the East Indies originating from the commercial centers of the [[Philippines]], plus the [[precious metal]]s and natural resources of Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of [[USD|US$]]1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in [[gold]] and silver received from New Spain.\n\nHowever, these resources did not translate into development for the [[Metropolis]] (mother country) due to Spanish Roman Catholic Monarchy's frequent preoccupation with European wars (enormous amounts of this wealth were spent hiring mercenaries to fight the [[Protestant Reformation]]), as well as the incessant decrease in overseas transportation caused by assaults from companies of British [[buccaneer]]s, Dutch [[Privateer|corsairs]] and [[piracy|pirates]] of various origin. These companies were initially financed by, at first, by the [[Amsterdam]] [[stock market]], the first in history and whose origin is owed precisely to the need for funds to finance pirate expeditions, as later by the London market. The above is what some authors call the \"historical process of the transfer of wealth from the south to the north.\"\n\n==The Bourbon reforms (1713\u20131806)==\n{{Main|Bourbon Reforms}}\n[[File:Portrait of Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, 1st Marquess of Sonora]], Visitador in New Spain, who initiated major reforms]]\n[[File:CarlosFranciscodeCroix.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlos Francisco de Croix, 1st Marquess of Croix]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]] (1766\u20131771)]]\n[[File:AntonioMariadeBucareliyUrsua.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]]]]\n[[File:JuanVicentedeGuemesPachecoyPadilla.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo]], [[Viceroy of New Spain]] (1789\u20131794)]]\n\nThe Bourbon monarchy embarked upon a far-reaching program to revitalize the economy of its territories, both on the peninsula and its overseas possessions. The crown sought to enhance its control and administrative efficiency, and to decrease the power and privilege of the Roman Catholic Church vis-a-vis the state.<ref>N.M. Farriss, ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759\u20131821: The Crisis of Ecclesiastical Privilege''.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1966.</ref>\n\nThe British capture and occupation of both Manila and Havana in 1762, during the global conflict of the [[Seven Years' War]], meant that the Spanish crown had to rethink its military strategy for defending its possessions. The Spanish crown had engaged with Britain for a number of years in low-intensity warfare, with ports and trade routes harassed by English privateers. The crown strengthened the defenses of [[Veracruz]] and [[San Juan de Ul\u00faa]], Jamaica, Cuba, and Florida, but the British sacked ports in the late seventeenth century. [[Santiago de Cuba]] (1662), [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] [[Spanish Florida]] (1665) and [[Campeche]] 1678 and so with the loss of Havana and Manila, Spain realized it needed to take significant steps. The Bourbons created a standing army in New Spain, beginning in 1764, and strengthened defensive infrastructure, such as forts.<ref>Christon Archer, ''The Army in Bourbon Mexico, 1760\u20131810''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1977.</ref><ref>Lyle N. McAlister, ''The ''Fuero Militar'' in New Spain, 1764\u20131800''. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1957.</ref>\n\nThe crown sought reliable information about New Spain and dispatched [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] as ''Visitador General'' (inspector general), who observed conditions needing reform, starting in 1765, in order to strengthen crown control over the kingdom.<ref>Susan Deans-Smith, \"Bourbon Reforms\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 153.</ref>\n\nAn important feature of the Bourbon Reforms was that they ended the significant amount of local control that was a characteristic of the bureaucracy under the Habsburgs, especially through the sale of offices. The Bourbons sought a return to the monarchical ideal of having those not directly connected with local elites as administrators, who in theory should be disinterested, staff the higher echelons of regional government. In practice this meant that there was a concerted effort to appoint mostly [[peninsulares]], usually military men with long records of service (as opposed to the Habsburg preference for prelates), who were willing to move around the global empire. The intendancies were one new office that could be staffed with peninsulares, but throughout the 18th century significant gains were made in the numbers of governors-captain generals, audiencia judges and bishops, in addition to other posts, who were Spanish-born.\n\nIn 1766, the crown appointed [[Carlos Francisco de Croix, marqu\u00e9s de Croix]] as viceroy of New Spain. One of his early tasks was to implement the crown's decision to expel the [[Jesuits]] from all its territories, accomplished in 1767. Since the Jesuits had significant power, owning large, well managed haciendas, educating New Spain's elite young men, and as a religious order resistant to crown control, the Jesuits were a major target for the assertion of crown control. Croix closed the religious autos-de-fe of the Holy Office of the Inquisition to public viewing, signaling a shift in the crown's attitude toward religion. Other significant accomplishments under Croix's administration was the founding of the College of Surgery in 1768, part of the crown's push to introduce institutional reforms that regulated professions. The crown was also interested in generating more income for its coffers and Croix instituted the royal lottery in 1769. Croix also initiated improvements in the capital and seat of the viceroyalty, increasing the size of its central park, the Alameda.\n\nAnother activist viceroy carrying out reforms was [[Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa]], marqu\u00e9s de Valleheroso y conde de Jerena, who served from 1771 to 1779, and died in office. Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez, now Minister of the Indies following his appointment as Visitor General of New Spain, briefed the newly appointed viceroy about reforms to be implemented. In 1776, a new northern territorial division was established, [[Provincias Internas|Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]] known as the ''Provincias Internas'' (Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North, {{lang-es|Comandancia y Capitan\u00eda General de las Provincias Internas}}). [[Teodoro de Croix]] (nephew of the former viceroy) was appointed the first Commander General of the Provincias Internas, independent of the Viceroy of New Spain, to provide better administration for the northern frontier provinces. They included [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Nuevo Santander]], [[Sonora y Sinaloa]], [[Las Californias]], [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (Coahuila and Texas), and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]. Bucareli was opposed to G\u00e1lvez's plan to implement the new administrative organization of intendancies, which he believed would burden areas with sparse population with excessive costs for the new bureaucracy.<ref>Christon I. Archer, \"Antonio Mar\u00eda Bucareli y Urs\u00faa\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 164.</ref>\n\nThe new Bourbon kings did not split the Viceroyalty of New Spain into smaller administrative units as they did with the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], carving out the [[Viceroyalty of R\u00edo de la Plata]] and the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], but New Spain was reorganized administratively and elite American-born Spanish men were passed over for high office. The crown also established a standing military, with the aim of defending its overseas territories. \n \nThe Spanish Bourbons monarchs' prime innovation introduction of [[Intendant|intendancies]], an institution emulating that of Bourbon France. They were first introduced on a large scale in New Spain, by the Minister of the Indies [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], in the 1770s, who originally envisioned that they would replace the viceregal system (viceroyalty) altogether. With broad powers over tax collection and the public treasury and with a mandate to help foster economic growth over their districts, intendants encroached on the traditional powers of viceroys, governors and local officials, such as the [[corregidor]]es, which were phased out as intendancies were established. The Crown saw the intendants as a check on these other officers. Over time accommodations were made. For example, after a period of experimentation in which an independent intendant was assigned to Mexico City, the office was thereafter given to the same person who simultaneously held the post of viceroy. Nevertheless, the creation of scores of autonomous intendancies throughout the Viceroyalty, created a great deal of decentralization, and in the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], in particular, the intendancy laid the groundwork for the future independent nations of the 19th century. In 1780, Minister of the Indies [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] sent a royal dispatch to [[Teodoro de Croix]], Commandant General of the Internal Provinces of New Spain ''(Provincias Internas)'', asking all subjects to donate money to help the American Revolution. Millions of pesos were given.\n\nThe focus on the economy (and the revenues it provided to the royal coffers) was also extended to society at large. Economic associations were promoted, such as the [[Sociedad Econ\u00f3mica de los Amigos del Pa\u00eds|Economic Society of Friends of the Country]]. Similar \"Friends of the Country\" economic societies were established throughout the Spanish world, including Cuba and Guatemala.<ref>{{harvp|Shafer|1958}}</ref>\n\nThe crown sent a series of scientific expeditions to its overseas possessions, including the [[Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain]], led by [[Mart\u00edn de Sess\u00e9]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mariano Moci\u00f1o]] (1787\u20131808).<ref>Daniela Bleichmar, ''Visible Empire: Botanical Expeditions and Visual Culture in the Hispanic Enlightenment''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press 2012, pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\nThe Bourbon Reforms were not a unified or entirely coherent program, but a series of crown initiatives designed to revitalize the economies of its overseas possessions and make administration more efficient and firmly under control of the crown. Record keeping improved and records were more centralized. The bureaucracy was staffed with well-qualified men, most of them peninsular-born Spaniards. The preference for them meant that there was resentment from American-born elite men and their families, who were excluded from holding office. The creation of a military meant that some American Spaniards became officers in local militias, but the ranks were filled with poor, mixed-race men, who resented service and avoided it if possible.<ref>Ida Altman et al., ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, pp. 316\u201317.</ref>\n\n==18th-century military conflicts==\n{{See also|Louisiana (New Spain)}}\n[[File:Dragon de cuera.jpg|thumb|18th-century ''[[soldado de cuera]]'' in [[colonial Mexico]]]]\nThe first century that saw the Bourbons on the [[Spain|Spanish]] throne coincided with series of [[Second Hundred Years' War|global conflicts]] that pitted primarily France against Great Britain. Spain as an ally of Bourbon France was drawn into these conflicts. In fact part of the motivation for the Bourbon Reforms was the perceived need to prepare the empire administratively, economically and militarily for what was the next expected war. The [[Seven Years' War]] proved to be catalyst for most of the reforms in the overseas possessions, just like the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] had been for the reforms on the Peninsula.\n\nIn 1720, the [[Villasur expedition]] from [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Santa Fe]] met and attempted to parley with [[French colonization of the Americas|French]]- allied [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] in what is now [[Nebraska]]. Negotiations were unsuccessful, and a battle ensued; the Spanish were badly defeated, with only thirteen managing to return to New Mexico. Although this was a small engagement, it is significant in that it was the deepest penetration of the Spanish into the [[Great Plains]], establishing the limit to Spanish expansion and influence there.\n\nThe [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] broke out in 1739 between the Spanish and British and was confined to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]]. The major action in the War of Jenkins' Ear was a major [[amphibious attack]] launched by the British under Admiral [[Edward Vernon]] in March 1741 against [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|Cartagena de Indias]], one of Spain's major gold-trading ports in the Caribbean (today [[Colombia]]). Although this episode is largely forgotten, it ended in a decisive victory for Spain, who managed to prolong its control of the Caribbean and indeed secure the [[Spanish Main]] until the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nFollowing the [[French and Indian War]]/[[Seven Years' War]], the British troops invaded and captured the Spanish cities of [[Havana]] in [[Cuba]] and [[Manila]] in the Philippines in 1762. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] gave Spain control over the [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] part of [[New France]] including [[New Orleans]], creating a Spanish empire that stretched from the [[Mississippi River]] to the Pacific Ocean; but Spain also ceded [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to Great Britain in order to regain Cuba, which the British occupied during the war. Louisiana settlers, hoping to restore the territory to France, in the bloodless [[Louisiana Rebellion of 1768|Rebellion of 1768]] forced the [[Louisiana Governor]] [[Antonio de Ulloa]] to flee to Spain. The rebellion was crushed in 1769 by the next governor [[Alejandro O'Reilly]], who executed five of the conspirators. The Louisiana territory was to be administered by superiors in Cuba with a governor on site in New Orleans.\n\nThe 21 northern [[Spanish missions in California#Present-day California missions|missions in present-day California]] (U.S.) were established along California's [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] from 1769. In an effort to exclude Britain and Russia from the eastern Pacific, King [[Charles III of Spain]] sent forth from Mexico a number of [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] between 1774 and 1793. Spain's long-held claims and navigation rights were strengthened and a settlement and fort were built in [[Nootka Sound]], Alaska.\n\n[[File:Cuadro por espa\u00f1a y por el rey, Galvez en America.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]] and his army at the [[Siege of Pensacola]] in 1781.]]\n\nSpain entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] as an ally of the United States and France in June 1779. From September 1779 to May 1781, [[Bernardo de Galvez]] led an army in a campaign along the [[Gulf Coast]] against the British. Galvez's army consisted of Spanish regulars from throughout Latin America and a militia which consisted of mostly [[Acadians]] along with Creoles, Germans, and Native Americans. Galvez's army engaged and defeated the British in battles fought at [[Capture of Fort Bute|Manchac]] and [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)|Baton Rouge]], Louisiana, [[Fort Rosalie|Natchez]], Mississippi, [[Battle of Fort Charlotte|Mobile]], Alabama, and [[Siege of Pensacola|Pensacola]], Florida. The loss of Mobile and Pensacola left the British with no bases along the Gulf Coast. In 1782, forces under Galvez's overall command [[Capture of The Bahamas (1782)|captured the British naval base]] at [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on [[New Providence]] Island in the [[Bahamas]]. Galvez was angry that the operation had proceeded against his orders to cancel, and ordered the arrest and imprisonment of [[Francisco de Miranda]], [[aide-de-camp]] of [[Juan Manuel Cajigal]], the commander of the expedition. Miranda later ascribed this action on the part of Galvez to jealousy of Cajigal's success.\n\nIn the second [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the American Revolution, Great Britain returned control of Florida back to Spain in exchange for the Bahamas. Spain then had control over the Mississippi River south of 32\u00b030' north latitude, and, in what is known as the Spanish Conspiracy, hoped to gain greater control of Louisiana and all of the west. These hopes ended when Spain was pressured into signing [[Pinckney's Treaty]] in 1795. France re-acquired Louisiana from Spain in the secret [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1800. The United States bought the territory from France in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803.\n[[File:NutcaEN.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Spanish territorial claims in the northern West Coast of North America, 18th century]]\n\nNew Spain claimed the entire west coast of North America and therefore considered the Russian fur trading activity in Alaska, which began in the middle to late 18th century, an encroachment and threat. Likewise, the exploration of the northwest coast by Captain [[James Cook]] of the British Navy and the subsequent fur trading activities by British ships was considered an encroachment on Spanish territory. To protect and strengthen its claim, New Spain sent a number of [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] between 1774 and 1793. In 1789, a naval outpost called [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]] (or just Nuca) was established at [[Friendly Cove]] in [[Nootka Sound]] (now Yuquot), [[Vancouver Island]]. It was protected by an [[artillery battery|artillery]] [[land battery]] called [[Fort San Miguel]]. Santa Cruz de Nuca was the northernmost establishment of New Spain. It was the first European colony in what is now the province of [[British Columbia]] and the only Spanish settlement in what is now [[Canada]]. Santa Cruz de Nuca remained under the control of New Spain until 1795, when it was abandoned under the terms of the third [[Nootka Convention]]. Another outpost, intended to replace Santa Cruz de Nuca, was partially built at [[Neah Bay, Washington|Neah Bay]] on the southern side of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] in what is now the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Neah Bay was known as ''Bah\u00eda de N\u00fa\u00f1ez Gaona'' in New Spain, and the outpost there was referred to as \"Fuca.\" It was abandoned, partially finished, in 1792. Its personnel, livestock, cannons, and ammunition were transferred to Nuca.<ref>{{harvp|Tovell|2008|pp=218\u2013219}}</ref>\n\nIn 1789, at Santa Cruz de Nuca, a conflict occurred between the Spanish naval officer [[Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Fern\u00e1ndez y Mart\u00ednez de la Sierra|Esteban Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez]] and the British merchant [[James Colnett]], triggering the [[Nootka Crisis]], which grew into an [[international incident]] and the threat of war between Britain and Spain. The first [[Nootka Convention]] averted the war but left many specific issues unresolved. Both sides sought to define a northern boundary for New Spain. At Nootka Sound, the diplomatic representative of New Spain, [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]], proposed a boundary at the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but the British representative, [[George Vancouver]] refused to accept any boundary north of [[San Francisco]]. No agreement could be reached and the northern boundary of New Spain remained unspecified until the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] with the United States (1819). That treaty also ceded [[Spanish Florida]] to the United States.\n\n==End of the Viceroyalty (1806\u20131821)==\nThe [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso]] ceded to France the vast territory that [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] then sold to the United States in 1803, known as the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The United States obtained [[Spanish Florida]] in 1819 in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]]. That treaty also defined a northern border for New Spain, at 42d north (now the northern boundary of the U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah).\n\nIn the 1821 [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], both Mexico and Central America declared their independence after three centuries of Spanish rule and formed the [[First Mexican Empire]], although Central America quickly rejected the union. After priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s 1810 [[Grito de Dolores]] (call for independence), the insurgent army began an eleven-year war. At first, the [[Criollo class]] fought against the rebels. But in 1820, a military coup in Spain forced Ferdinand VII to accept the authority of the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Spanish Constitution]]. The specter of liberalism that could undermine the authority and autonomy of the Roman Catholic Church made the Church hierarchy in New Spain view independence in a different light. In an independent nation, the Church anticipated retaining its power. Royalist military officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] proposed uniting with the insurgents with whom he had battled, and gained the alliance of [[Vicente Guerrero]], leader of the insurgents in a region now bearing his name. Royal government collapsed in New Spain and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] marched triumphantly into Mexico City in 1821.\n\nThe new [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]] offered the crown to [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] or to a member of the Spanish royal family that he would designate. After the refusal of the Spanish monarchy to recognize the independence of Mexico, the ''{{lang|es|ej\u00e9rcito Trigarante}}'' ([[Army of the Three Guarantees]]), led by Agust\u00edn de Iturbide and [[Vicente Guerrero]], cut all political and economic ties with Spain and crowned Iturbide as [[List of Emperors of Mexico|emperor Agust\u00edn of Mexico]]. Central America was originally planned to be part of the Mexican Empire; but it seceded peacefully in 1823, forming the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]] under the [[Constitution of 1824]].\n\nThis left only [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] in the [[Spanish West Indies]], and the [[Spanish East Indies]] in the Spanish Empire; until their loss to the United States in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898).\n\n== Political organization ==\nThe Viceroyalty of New Spain united many regions and provinces of the Spanish Empire throughout half a world. These included on the North American mainland, central Mexico, [[Nueva Extremadura]], [[Nueva Galicia]], [[the Californias]], [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]], [[Nuevo Reyno de Le\u00f3n]], [[Spanish Texas|Texas]] and [[Nuevo Santander]], as well as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]].\n\nIn the Caribbean it included Cuba, [[Colony of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]], most of the [[Venezuela|Venezuelan mainland]] and the other islands in the Caribbean controlled by the Spanish. In Asia, the Viceroyalty ruled the [[Spanish East Indies|Captaincy General of the Philippines]], which covered all of the Spanish territories in the Asia-Pacific region. The outpost at Nootka Sound, on [[Vancouver Island]], was considered part of the province of California.\n\nTherefore, the Viceroyalty's former territories included what is now the countries of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]]; the United States states and territories of [[California]], [[Texas]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Florida]]; a portion of the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]]; the Caribbean nations of [[Cuba]], the [[Dominican Republic]], the island of [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; the Asia-Pacific nations of the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], [[Mariana Islands]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Palau]] and [[Caroline Islands]], as well as during a century the island of [[Tidore]] in [[Indonesia]].\n\nThe Viceroyalty was administered by a [[viceroy]] residing in [[Mexico City]] and appointed by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish monarch]], who had administrative oversight of all of these regions, although most matters were handled by the local governmental bodies, which ruled the various regions of the viceroyalty. First among these were the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s'', which were primarily superior tribunals, but which also had administrative and legislative functions. Each of these was responsible to the Viceroy of New Spain in administrative matters (though not in judicial ones), but they also answered directly to the [[Council of the Indies]].\n\nAudiencia districts further incorporated the older, smaller divisions known as [[governorate]]s (''gobernaciones'', roughly equivalent to [[provinces]]), which had been originally established by conquistador-governors known as ''[[adelantado]]s''. Provinces which were under military threat were grouped into [[Captaincy|captaincies general]], such as the Captaincies General of the Philippines (established 1574) and Guatemala (established in 1609) mentioned above, which were joint military and political commands with a certain level of autonomy. (The viceroy was captain-general of those provinces that remained directly under his command).\n\nAt the local level there were over two hundred districts, in both Indian and Spanish areas, which were headed by either a ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'' (also known as an ''alcalde mayor'') or a ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' (town council), both of which had judicial and administrative powers. In the late 18th century the Bourbon dynasty began phasing out the ''corregidores'' and introduced [[intendant]]s, whose broad fiscal powers cut into the authority of the viceroys, governors and ''cabildos''. Despite their late creation, these intendancies so affected the formation of regional identity that they became the basis for the nations of Central America and the first Mexican states after independence.\n\n===Captaincies general===\nThe [[Captaincy General]]s were the second-level [[administrative division]]s and these were relatively [[autonomous]].\nWith dates of creation:\n\n#[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1535)\n#[[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]] (1574)\n#[[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]] (1580)\n#[[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] (1607)\n##Governorate of [[Spanish Florida]], (Spanish: ''La Florida'') (the [[Governorate#Spanish Empire|governorate]]s were a third-level administrative divisions)\n##Governorate of [[Spanish Louisiana]] (Spanish: ''Luisiana'')\n#[[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]] (1609)\n#[[Captaincy General of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] (1617)\n#[[Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]] (1776) (analogous to a dependent captaincy general)\n\n===Intendancies===\nAs part of the sweeping eighteenth-century administrative and economic changes known as the [[Bourbon Reforms]], the Spanish crown created new administrative units called [[Intendant (government official)|intendancies]]. The intendencies aimed at strengthening Crown control over the viceroyalty and measures aimed to break the monopoly that local elites had in the municipal government in order to improve the economy of the empire, and other reforms including the improvement of the public participation in communal affairs, distribution of undeveloped lands to the Indians and Spaniards, end the corruption practices of the mayors, it also sought to favor handicrafts and encourage trade and mining, and establish a system of territorial division similar to the model created by the government of [[Kingdom of France|France]], already adopted in Spain. These acted together with the general captaincies and the viceroyalties, they never changed the traditional administrative divisions, intendancies found strong resistance by the viceroyalties, general captaincies (also found great rejection in the Iberian peninsula when it was adopted), royal audiencias and ecclesiastical hierarchs for its important intervention in economic issues, by its centralist politics and by its opposition to cede very much of their functions to the intendants, to whom they bound them with a crown absolutism; in this context there was the outbreak of the [[American Revolution|Revolution of Independence of the English colonies in North America]], which forced to protest the central points of the reformist program in the Spanish Americas, because due to the war with England in which Spain participated, it was not convenient to apply for the moment drastic measures that would put at risk the financial support of the Spanish-American subsidies; all this prevented its full application.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.iberlibro.com/9789684441798/Historia-Mexico-Proceso-Gestacion-Pueblo-9684441797/plp|title=Historia de M\u00e9xico.

In New Spain the high court was established in 1527, prior to the establishment of the viceroyalty. The First Audiencia was headed by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]'s rival [[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]], who used the court to deprive Cort\u00e9s of power and property. The First Audiencia was dissolved and the Second Audiencia established.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=69}}</ref>\n\nAudiencias with dates of creation:\n\n#[[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1511, effective 1526, predated the Viceroyalty)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Mexico|Mexico]] (1527, predated the Viceroyalty)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Panama|Panama]] (1st one, 1538\u20131543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Guatemala]] (1543)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] (1548)\n#[[Real Audiencia of Manila|Manila]] (1583)\n\n==Regions of mainland New Spain==\nIn the colonial period, basic patterns of regional development emerged and strengthened.<ref name=\"provinces\">{{harvp|Lockhart|Altman|1976}}</ref> European settlement and institutional life was built in the [[Mesoamerican]] heartland of the [[Aztec Empire]] in Central Mexico. The South (Oaxaca, Michoacan, Yucat\u00e1n, and Central America) was a region of dense indigenous settlement of Mesoamerica, but without exploitable resources of interest to Europeans, the area attracted few Europeans, while the indigenous presence remained strong. The North was outside the area of complex indigenous populations, inhabited primarily by nomadic and hostile northern indigenous groups. With the discovery of silver in the north, the Spanish sought to conquer or pacify those peoples in order to exploit the mines and develop enterprises to supply them. Nonetheless, much of northern New Spain had sparse indigenous population and attracted few Europeans. The Spanish crown and later the Republic of Mexico did not effectively exert sovereignty over the region, leaving it vulnerable to the expansionism of the United States in the nineteenth century.\n\nRegional characteristics of colonial Mexico have been the focus of considerable study within the vast scholarship on centers and peripheries.<ref name=\"provinces\"/><ref>{{harvp|Van Young|1992}}</ref> For those based in the vice-regal capital of Mexico City itself, everywhere else were the \"provinces.\" Even in the modern era, \"Mexico\" for many refers solely to Mexico City, with the pejorative view of anywhere but the capital is a hopeless backwater.<ref>{{harvp|Monsiva\u00eds|1992|pp=247\u2013254}}</ref> \"Fuera de M\u00e9xico, todo es Cuauhtitl\u00e1n\" [\"outside of Mexico City, it's all Podunk\"],<ref>{{harvp|Van Young|1992|loc=p. 3 n. 3}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Van Young|2006|p=xxviii}}</ref> that is, poor, marginal, and backward, in short, the periphery. The picture is far more complex, however; while the capital is enormously important as the center of power of various kinds (institutional, economic, social), the provinces played a significant role in colonial Mexico. Regions (provinces) developed and thrived to the extent that they were sites of economic production and tied into networks of trade. \"Spanish society in the Indies was import-export oriented at the very base and in every aspect,\" and the development of many regional economies was usually centered on support of that export sector.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Central region===\n====Mexico City, Capital of the Viceroyalty====\n{{Main|History of Mexico City}}\nMexico City was the center of the Central region, and the hub of New Spain. The [[history of Mexico City|development of Mexico City]] itself is extremely important to the development of New Spain as a whole. It was the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Archdiocese of the Catholic Church, the Holy Office of the [[Inquisition]], the merchants' guild (''consulado''), and home of the most elite families in the Kingdom of New Spain. Mexico City was the single-most populous city, not just in New Spain, but for many years the entire Western Hemisphere, with a high concentration of mixed-race [[castas]].\n\n====Veracruz to Mexico City====\nSignificant regional development grew along the main transportation route from the capital east to the port of Veracruz. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] called this area \"Mesa de Anahuac\", which can be defined as the adjacent valleys of Puebla, Mexico, and Toluca, enclosed by high mountains, along with their connections to the Gulf Coast port of Veracruz and the Pacific port of [[Acapulco]], where over half the population of New Spain lived.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|loc=map 2 p. 6; p. 288}}</ref> These valleys were linked trunk lines, or main routes, facilitating the movement of vital goods and people to get to key areas.<ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1991}}</ref> However, even in this relatively richly endowed region of Mexico, the difficulty of transit of people and goods in the absence of rivers and level terrain remained a major challenge to the economy of New Spain. This challenge persisted during the post-independence years until the late nineteenth-century construction of railroads. In the colonial era and up until the railroads were built in key areas, mule trains were the main mode of transporting goods. Mules were used because unpaved roads and mountainous terrain could not generally accommodate carts.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century the crown devoted some resources to the study and remedy the problem of poor roads. The Camino Real (royal road) between the port of Veracruz and the capital had some short sections paved and bridges constructed. The construction was done despite protests from some Indian villages when the infrastructure improvements, which sometimes included rerouting the road through communal lands. The Spanish crown finally decided that road improvement was in the interests of the state for military purposes, as well as for fomenting commerce, agriculture, and industry, but the lack of state involvement in the development of physical infrastructure was to have lasting effects constraining development until the late nineteenth century.<ref>{{harvp|Castleman|2005|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Coatsworth|1998|p=34}}</ref> Despite some improvements, the roads still made transit difficult, particularly for heavy military equipment.\n\nAlthough the crown had ambitious plans for both the Toluca and Veracruz portions of the king's highway, actual improvements were limited to a localized network.<ref>{{harvp|Castleman|2005|p=31}}</ref> Even where infrastructure was improved, transit on the Veracruz-Puebla main road had other obstacles, with wolves attacking mule trains, killing animals, and rendering some sacks of foodstuffs unsellable because they were smeared with blood.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=90}}</ref> The north-south Acapulco route remained a mule track through mountainous terrain.\n\n====Veracruz, port city and province====\nVeracruz was the first Spanish settlement founded in what became New Spain, and it endured as the only viable Gulf Coast port, the gateway for Spain to New Spain. The difficult topography around the port affected local development and New Spain as a whole. Going from the port to the central plateau entailed a daunting 2000 meter climb from the narrow tropical coastal plain in just over a hundred kilometers. The narrow, slippery road in the mountain mists was treacherous for mule trains, and in some cases mules were hoisted by ropes. Many tumbled with their cargo to their deaths.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=68}}</ref> Given these transport constraints, only high-value, low-bulk goods continued to be shipped in the transatlantic trade, which stimulated local production of foodstuffs, rough textiles, and other products for a mass market. Although New Spain produced considerable sugar and wheat, these were consumed exclusively in the colony even though there was demand elsewhere. Philadelphia, not New Spain, supplied Cuba with wheat.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|p=67}}, quoting Alexander von Humboldt.</ref>\n\nThe Caribbean port of Veracruz was small, with its hot, pestilential climate not a draw for permanent settlers: its population never topped 10,000.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1991|p=3}}</ref> Many Spanish merchants preferred living in the pleasant highland town of Jalapa (1,500 m). For a brief period (1722\u201376) the town of Jalapa became even more important than Veracruz, after it was granted the right to hold the royal trade fair for New Spain, serving as the entrepot for goods from Asia via [[Manila Galleon]] through the port of Acapulco and European goods via the flota (convoy) from the Spanish port of C\u00e1diz.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1979|p=124}}</ref> Spaniards also settled in the temperate area of Orizaba, east of the Citlaltepetl volcano. Orizaba varied considerably in elevation from {{convert|800|m}} to {{convert|5700|m}} (the summit of the Citlaltepetl volcano), but \"most of the inhabited part is temperate.\"<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=205}}</ref> Some Spaniards lived in semitropical C\u00f3rdoba, which was founded as a villa in 1618, to serve as a Spanish base against runaway slave ([[cimarr\u00f3nes|cimarr\u00f3n]]) predations on mule trains traveling the route from the port to the capital. Some cimarr\u00f3n settlements sought autonomy, such as one led by [[Gaspar Yanga]], with whom the crown concluded a treaty leading to the recognition of a largely black town, San Lorenzo de los Negros de Cerralvo, now called the municipality of Yanga.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nEuropean diseases immediately affected the multiethnic Indian populations in the Veracruz area and for that reason Spaniards imported black slaves as either an alternative to indigenous labor or its complete replacement in the event of a repetition of the Caribbean die-off. A few Spaniards acquired prime agricultural lands left vacant by the indigenous demographic disaster. Portions of the province could support sugar cultivation and as early as the 1530s sugar production was underway. New Spain's first viceroy, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] established an hacienda on lands taken from Orizaba.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=206}}</ref>\n\nIndians resisted cultivating sugarcane themselves, preferring to tend their subsistence crops. As in the Caribbean, black slave labor became crucial to the development of sugar estates. During the period 1580\u20131640 when Spain and Portugal were ruled by the same monarch and Portuguese slave traders had access to Spanish markets, African slaves were imported in large numbers to New Spain and many of them remained in the region of Veracruz. But even when that connection was broken and prices rose, black slaves remained an important component of C\u00f3rdoba's labor sector even after 1700. Rural estates in C\u00f3rdoba depended on African slave labor, who were 20% of the population there, a far greater proportion than any other area of New Spain, and greater than even nearby Jalapa.<ref>{{harvp|Carroll|1991|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn 1765 the crown created a monopoly on tobacco, which directly affected agriculture and manufacturing in the Veracruz region. Tobacco was a valuable, high-demand product. Men, women, and even children smoked, something commented on by foreign travelers and depicted in eighteenth-century [[casta]] paintings.<ref>{{harvp|Ouweneel|1997|pp=188\u2013189}}</ref> The crown calculated that tobacco could produce a steady stream of tax revenues by supplying the huge Mexican demand, so the crown limited zones of tobacco cultivation. It also established a small number of manufactories of finished products, and licensed distribution outlets (''estanquillos'').<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992}}. This is the definitive study of the tobacco monopoly.</ref> The crown also set up warehouses to store up to a year's worth of supplies, including paper for cigarettes, for the manufactories.<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992|p=106}}</ref> With the establishment of the monopoly, crown revenues increased and there is evidence that despite high prices and expanding rates of poverty, tobacco consumption rose while at the same time, general consumption fell.<ref>{{harvp|Deans-Smith|1992|p=157}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]] Veracruz became an [[intendancy]], a new administrative unit.\n\n====Valley of Puebla====\nFounded in 1531 as a Spanish settlement, [[Puebla de los Angeles]] quickly rose to the status of Mexico's second-most important city. Its location on the main route between the viceregal capital and the port of Veracruz, in a fertile basin with a dense indigenous population, largely not held in encomienda, made Puebla a destination for many later arriving Spaniards. If there had been significant mineral wealth in Puebla, it could have been even more prominent a center for New Spain, but its first century established its importance. In 1786 it became the capital of an [[intendancy]] of the same name.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=220\u2013224}}</ref>\n\nIt became the seat of the richest diocese in New Spain in its first century, with the seat of the first diocese, formerly in Tlaxcala, moved there in 1543.<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1952|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Bishop [[Juan de Palafox]] asserted the income from the diocese of Puebla as being twice that of the archbishopic of Mexico, due to the tithe income derived from agriculture.<ref>{{harvp|Israel|1975|p=219}}</ref> In its first hundred years, Puebla was prosperous from wheat farming and other agriculture, as the ample tithe income indicates, plus manufacturing woolen cloth for the domestic market. Merchants, manufacturers, and artisans were important to the city's economic fortunes, but its early prosperity was followed by stagnation and decline in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=16}}</ref>\n\nThe foundation of the town of Puebla was a pragmatic social experiment to settle Spanish immigrants without encomiendas to pursue farming and industry.<ref name=\"Hirschberg\">{{harvp|Hirschberg|1979}}</ref> Puebla was privileged in a number of ways, starting with its status as a Spanish settlement not founded on existing indigenous city-state, but with a significant indigenous population. It was located in a fertile basin on a temperate plateau in the nexus of the key trade triangle of Veracruz\u2013Mexico City\u2013Antequera (Oaxaca). Although there were no encomiendas in Puebla itself, encomenderos with nearby labor grants settled in Puebla. And despite its foundation as a Spanish city, sixteenth-century Puebla had Indians resident in the central core.<ref name=\"Hirschberg\"/>\n\nAdministratively Puebla was far enough away from Mexico City (approximately {{convert|160|km|abbr=on|disp=or|-1}}) so as not to be under its direct influence. Puebla's Spanish town council (cabildo) had considerable autonomy and was not dominated by encomenderos. The administrative structure of Puebla \"may be seen as a subtle expression of royal absolutism, the granting of extensive privileges to a town of commoners, amounting almost to republican self-government, in order to curtail the potential authority of encomenderos and the religious orders, as well as to counterbalance the power of the viceregal capital.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the \"golden century\" from its founding in 1531 until the early 1600s, Puebla's agricultural sector flourished, with small-scale Spanish farmers plowing the land for the first time, planting wheat and vaulting Puebla to importance as New Spain's breadbasket, a role assumed by the [[Baj\u00edo]] (including Quer\u00e9taro) in the seventeenth century, and Guadalajara in the eighteenth.<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989|p=12}}</ref> Puebla's wheat production was the initial element of its prosperity, but it emerged as a manufacturing and commercial center, \"serving as the inland port of Mexico's Atlantic trade.\"<ref>{{harvp|Thomson|1989}}, citing Pierre Chaunu ''Seville et l'Atlantique 1504\u20131650'', Pt. 2, vol. VIII 1959, 714.</ref> Economically, the city received exemptions from the ''alcabala'' (sales tax) and ''almojarifazgo'' (import/export duties) for its first century (1531\u20131630), which helped promote commerce.\n\nPuebla built a significant manufacturing sector, mainly in textile production in workshops (obrajes), supplying New Spain and markets as far away as Guatemala and Peru. Transatlantic ties between a particular Spanish town, [[Brihuega]], and Puebla demonstrate the close connection between the two settlements. The take-off for Puebla's manufacturing sector did not simply coincide with immigration from Brihuega but was crucial to \"shaping and driving Puebla's economic development, especially in the manufacturing sector.\"<ref>{{harvp|Altman|2000|p=51}}</ref> Brihuega immigrants not only came to Mexico with expertise in textile production, but the transplanted briocenses provided capital to create large-scale obrajes. Although obrajes in Brihuega were small-scale enterprises, quite a number of them in Puebla employed up to 100 workers. Supplies of wool, water for fulling mills, and labor (free indigenous, incarcerated Indians, black slaves) were available. Although much of Puebla's textile output was rough cloth, it also produced higher quality dyed cloth with [[cochineal]] from Oaxaca and [[indigo]] from [[Guatemala]].<ref>{{harvp|Altman|2000|p=62}}</ref> But by the eighteenth century, [[Quer\u00e9taro]] had displaced Puebla as the mainstay of woolen textile production.<ref>{{harvp|Salvucci|1987|p=80}}</ref>\n\nIn 1787, Puebla became an [[intendancy]] as part of the new administrative structuring of the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n====Valley of Mexico====\nMexico City dominated the Valley of Mexico, but the valley continued to have dense indigenous populations challenged by growing, increasingly dense Spanish settlement. The Valley of Mexico had many former Indian city-states that became Indian towns in the colonial era. These towns continued to be ruled by indigenous elites under the Spanish crown, with an indigenous governor and a town councils.<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1964}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Lockhart|1992}}</ref> These Indian towns close to the capital were the most desirable ones for encomenderos to hold and for the friars to evangelize.\n\nThe capital was provisioned by the indigenous towns, and its labor was available for enterprises that ultimately created a colonial economy. The gradual drying up of the central lake system created more dry land for farming, but the sixteenth-century population declines allowed Spaniards to expand their acquisition of land. One region that retained strong Indian land holding was the southern fresh water area, with important suppliers of fresh produce to the capital. The area was characterized by intensely cultivated chinampas, man-made extensions of cultivable land into the lake system. These chinampa towns retained a strong indigenous character, and Indians continued to hold the majority of that land, despite its closeness to the Spanish capital. A key example is [[Xochimilco]].<ref>{{harvp|Gibson|1964|p=409}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cline|1991|pp=265\u2013274}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Rojas Rabiela|1991}}</ref>\n\nTexcoco in the pre-conquest period was one of the three members of the Aztec Triple Alliance and the cultural center of the empire. It fell on hard times in the colonial period as an economic backwater. Spaniards with any ambition or connections would be lured by the closeness of Mexico City, so that the Spanish presence was minimal and marginal.<ref>{{harvp|Lewis|1976}}</ref>\n\nTlaxcala, the major ally of the Spanish against the Aztecs of Tenochtitlan, also became something of a backwater, but like Puebla it did not come under the control of Spanish encomenderos. No elite Spaniards settled there, but like many other Indian towns in the Valley of Mexico, it had an assortment of small-scale merchants, artisans, farmers and ranchers, and textile workshops (obrajes).<ref>{{harvp|Szewczyk|1976}}</ref>\n\n===The North===\nSince portions of northern New Spain became part of the United States' [[Southwest United States|Southwest region]], there has been considerable scholarship on the Spanish borderlands in the north. The motor of the Spanish colonial economy was the extraction of [[silver]]. In [[Bolivia]], it was from the single rich mountain of [[Cerro de Potos\u00ed|Potos\u00ed]]; but in New Spain, there were two major mining sites, one in [[Zacatecas]], the other in [[Guanajuato]].\n\nThe region farther north of the main mining zones attracted few Spanish settlers. Where there were settled [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous populations]], such as in the present-day state of [[New Mexico]] and in coastal regions of [[Baja California (region)|Baja]] and [[Alta California]], indigenous culture retained considerable integrity.\n\n====The Baj\u00edo, Mexico's Breadbasket====\nThe [[Baj\u00edo]], a rich, fertile lowland just north of central Mexico, was nonetheless a frontier region between the densely populated plateaus and valleys of Mexico's center and south and the harsh northern desert controlled by nomadic Chichimeca. Devoid of settled indigenous populations in the early sixteenth century, the Baj\u00edo did not initially attract Spaniards, who were much more interested in exploiting labor and collecting tribute whenever possible. The region did not have indigenous populations that practiced subsistence agriculture. The Baj\u00edo developed in the colonial period as a region of commercial agriculture.\n\nThe discovery of mining deposits in Zacatecas and Guanajuato in the mid-sixteenth century and later in San Luis Potos\u00ed stimulated the Baj\u00edo's development to supply the mines with food and livestock. A network of Spanish towns was established in this region of commercial agriculture, with Quer\u00e9taro also becoming a center of textile production. Although there were no dense indigenous populations or network of settlements, Indians migrated to the Baj\u00edo to work as resident employees on the region's haciendas and ranchos or rented land (terrasguerros). From diverse cultural backgrounds and with no sustaining indigenous communities, these indios were quickly hispanized, but largely remained at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1986|pp=52\u201354}}</ref> Although Indians migrated willingly to the region, they did so in such small numbers that labor shortages prompted Spanish hacendados to provide incentives to attract workers, especially in the initial boom period of the early seventeenth century. Land owners lent workers money, which could be seen as a perpetual indebtedness, but it can be seen not as coercing Indians to stay but a way estate owners sweetened their terms of employment, beyond their basic wage labor.<ref>{{harvp|Brading|1978|pp=76\u201377}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|pp=339\u2013378}}</ref> For example, in 1775 the Spanish administrator of a San Luis Potos\u00ed estate \"had to scour both Mexico City and the northern towns to find enough blue French linen to satisfy the resident employees.\"<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=354}}</ref> Other types of goods they received on credit were textiles, hats, shoes, candles, meat, beans, and a guaranteed ration of maize. However, where labor was more abundant or market conditions depressed, estate owners paid lower wages. The more sparsely populated northern Baj\u00edo tended to pay higher wages than the southern Baj\u00edo, which was increasingly integrated in the economy of central Mexico.<ref name=\"Tutino_1979_364\">{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=364}}</ref> The credit-based employment system often privileged those holding higher ranked positions on the estate (supervisors, craftsmen, other specialists) who were mostly white, and the estates did not demand repayment.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=363}}</ref>\n\nIn the late colonial period, renting complemented estate employment for many non-Indians in more central areas of the Baj\u00edo with access to markets. As with hacendados, renters produced for the commercial market. While these Baj\u00edo renters could prosper in good times and achieved a level of independence, drought and other disasters made their choice more risky than beneficial.<ref>{{harvp|Tutino|1979|p=366}}</ref>\n\nMany renters retained ties to the estates, diversifying their household's sources of income and level of economic security. In San Luis Potos\u00ed, rentals were fewer and estate employment the norm. After a number of years of drought and bad harvests in the first decade of the nineteenth century Hidalgo's 1810 grito appealed more in the Baj\u00edo than in San Luis Potos\u00ed. In the Baj\u00edo estate owners were evicting tenants in favor of renters better able to pay more for land, there was a disruption of previous patterns of mutual benefit between estate owners and renters.<ref name=\"Tutino_1979_364\"/>\n\n===Spanish Borderlands===\nAreas of northern Mexico were incorporated into the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, following Texas independence and the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348) and generally known as the \"Spanish Borderlands.\"<ref>{{harvp|Bannon|1974}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Weber|1991}}</ref> Scholars in the United States have extensively studied this northern region, which became the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California.<ref>{{harvp|Bolton|1956}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Cutter|1995}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Spicer|1962}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Weber|1992}}</ref> During the period of Spanish rule, this area was sparsely populated even by indigenous peoples.<ref>{{harvp|Jackson|1994}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Presidio]]s (forts), [[pueblo]]s (civilian towns) and the [[List of Spanish missions|misiones]] (missions) were the three major agencies employed by the Spanish crown to extend its borders and consolidate its colonial holdings in these territories.\n\n====Missions and the Northern Frontier====\nThe town of [[Albuquerque]] (present day Albuquerque, [[New Mexico]]) was founded in 1706. Other Mexican towns in the region included Paso del Norte (present day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]]), founded in 1667; Santiago de la [[Monclova]] in 1689; Panzacola, Tejas in 1681; and San Francisco de Cu\u00e9llar (present day city of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]) in 1709. From 1687, [[Father Kino|Father Eusebio Francisco Kino]], with funding from the Marqu\u00e9s de Villapuente, founded over twenty [[Spanish missions in the Sonoran Desert|missions]] in the [[Sonoran Desert]] (in present-day [[Sonora]] and Arizona). From 1697, Jesuits established eighteen [[Spanish missions in California#Missions in present-day Baja California (Mexico)|missions throughout the Baja California Peninsula]]. Between 1687 and 1700 several [[Spanish missions in Trinidad|missions were founded in Trinidad]], but only four survived as Amerindian villages throughout the 18th century. In 1691, explorers and missionaries visited the interior of Texas and came upon a river and Amerindian settlement on 13 June, the feast day of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony]], and named the location and river [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] in his honor.\n\n====New Mexico====\nDuring the term of [[viceroy]] Don [[Luis de Velasco, marqu\u00e9s de Salinas]] the crown ended the long-running [[Chichimeca War]] by making peace with the semi-nomadic [[Chichimeca]] indigenous tribes of northern M\u00e9xico in 1591. This allowed expansion into the 'Province of New Mexico' or ''[[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|Provincia de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]''. In 1595, Don [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]], son of one the key figures in the silver remining region of Zacatecas, received official permission from the viceroy to explore and conquer New Mexico. As was the pattern of such expeditions, the leader assumed the greatest risk but would reap the largest rewards, so that O\u00f1ate would become ''capit\u00e1n general'' of New Mexico and had the authority to distribute rewards to those in the expedition.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|pp=193\u2013194}}</ref> O\u00f1ate pioneered 'The Royal Road of the Interior Land' or ''[[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]]'' between [[Mexico City]] and the [[Tewa people|Tewa]] village of [[Ohkay Owingeh, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh]], or San Juan Pueblo. He also founded the Spanish settlement of [[San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge]] on the [[Rio Grande]] near the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Pueblo, located just north of the present day city of [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico]].<ref>{{harvp|Sanchez|Spude|2013|loc=Chapters 2 & 3}}</ref>\n\nHowever, O\u00f1ate eventually learned that New Mexico, while it had a settled indigenous population, contained little arable land, had no silver mines, and possessed few other resources to exploit that would merit large scale colonization. Accordingly, he resigned as governor in 1607 and left New Mexico, having spent much of his personal wealth on the enterprise.<ref>{{harvp|Altman|Cline|Pescador|2003|p=194}}</ref>\n\nIn 1610, [[Pedro de Peralta]], a later [[Spanish governors of New Mexico|governor of the Province of New Mexico]], established the settlement of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] near the southern end of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains|Sangre de Cristo]] mountain range. [[List of Spanish missions|Missions]] were established to convert the locals, and manage the agricultural industry. The territory's [[Puebloan peoples|indigenous population]] resented the Spanish prohibition of their traditional religion, and the [[encomienda]] system of forced labor. The unrest led to the [[Pueblo Revolt]] in 1680, forcing the Spanish to retreat to Paso del Norte (modern-day [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].) After the return of the Spanish in 1692, the final resolution included a marked reduction of Spanish efforts to eradicate native culture and religion, the issuing of substantial communal [[land grant]]s to each Pueblo, and a public defender of their rights and for their legal cases in Spanish courts. In 1776 the Province came under the new [[Provincias Internas]] jurisdiction. In the late 18th century the [[Spanish land grants in New Mexico|Spanish land grant]] encouraged the settlement by individuals of large land parcels outside [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] and Pueblo boundaries, many of which became ranchos.<ref>{{harvp|Gonzales|2003}}</ref>\n\n====California====\nIn 1602, [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]], the first Spanish presence in the 'New California' (''Nueva California'') region of the frontier [[Las Californias]] province since Cabrillo in 1542, sailed as far north up the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] as present-day [[Oregon]], and named California coastal features from [[San Diego]] to as far north as [[Monterey Bay|the Bay of Monterrey]].\n\nNot until the eighteenth century was California of much interest to the Spanish crown, since it had no known rich mineral deposits or indigenous populations sufficiently organized to render tribute and do labor for Spaniards. The [[California gold rush|discovery of huge deposits of gold]] in the Sierra Nevada foothills did not come until after the U.S. had incorporated California following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348).\n\nBy the middle of the 1700s, the Catholic order of [[Jesuits]] had established a number of missions on the [[Baja California Peninsula|''Baja'' (lower) California peninsula]]. Then, in 1767, [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles III]] ordered all Jesuits expelled from all Spanish possessions, including New Spain.<ref>{{harvp|Weber|1992|p=242}}</ref> New Spain's Visitador General [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]] replaced them with the [[Dominican Order]] in Baja California, and the [[Franciscans]] were chosen to establish new northern missions in [[Alta California|''Alta'' (upper) California]].\n\nIn 1768, G\u00e1lvez received the following orders: \"Occupy and fortify San Diego and Monterey for God and the King of Spain.\" The [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization there, with far fewer known natural resources and less cultural development than Mexico or Peru, was to combine establishing a presence for defense of the territory with a perceived responsibility to convert the indigenous people to Christianity.\n\nThe method used to \"occupy and fortify\" was the established Spanish colonial system: [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] (''misiones'', between 1769 and 1833 twenty-one missions were established) aimed at converting the [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Californians]] to Christianity, [[presidio|forts]] (''presidios'', four total) to protect the missionaries, and secular [[pueblo (disambiguation)|municipalities]] (''pueblos'', three total). Due to the region's great distance from supplies and support in M\u00e9xico, the system had to be largely self-sufficient. As a result, the colonial population of California remained small, widely scattered and near the coast.\n\nIn 1776, the north-western frontier areas came under the administration of the new 'Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North' ''([[Provincias Internas]])'', designed to streamline administration and invigorate growth. The crown created two new provincial governments from the former [[Las Californias]] in 1804; the southern peninsula became Baja California, and the ill-defined northern mainland frontier area became Alta California.\n\nOnce missions and protective presidios were established in an area, large [[Spanish land grants in California|land grants]] encouraged settlement and establishment of [[Ranchos of California|California ranchos]]. The Spanish system of land grants was not very successful, however, because the grants were merely royal concessions\u2014not actual land ownership. Under later Mexican rule, land grants conveyed ownership, and were more successful at promoting settlement.\n\nRancho activities centered on cattle-raising; many grantees emulated the [[Don (honorific)|Dons]] of [[Spain]], with cattle, horses and sheep the source of wealth. The work was usually done by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], sometimes displaced and/or relocated from their villages. Native-born descendants of the resident Spanish-heritage rancho grantees, soldiers, servants, merchants, craftsmen and others became the [[Californio]]s. Many of the less-affluent men took native wives, and many daughters married later English, French and American settlers.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1821) and subsequent [[secularization]] (\"disestablishment\") of the missions (1834), Mexican land grant transactions increased the spread of the rancho system. The land grants and ranchos established mapping and land-ownership patterns that are still recognizable in present-day California and New Mexico.<ref>{{harvp|Robinson|1979}}</ref>\n\n===The South===\n====Yucat\u00e1n====\nThe Yucat\u00e1n peninsula can be seen as a cul-de-sac,<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=3}}</ref> and it does indeed have unique features, but it also has strong similarities to other areas in the South. The Yucat\u00e1n peninsula extends into the Gulf of Mexico and was connected to Caribbean trade routes and Mexico City, far more than some other southern regions, such as Oaxaca.<ref name=\"Hunt_59_60\">{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=59\u201360}}</ref> There was three main Spanish settlements, the inland city of M\u00e9rida, where Spanish civil and religious officials had their headquarters and where the many Spaniards in the province lived. The ''villa'' of Campeche was the peninsula's port, the key gateway for the whole region. A merchant group developed and expanded dramatically as trade flourished during the seventeenth century.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=38\u201342}}</ref> Although that period was once characterized as New Spain's \"century of depression,\" for Yucat\u00e1n this was certainly not the case, with sustained growth from the early seventeenth century to the end of the colonial period.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=39, 59\u201360}}</ref>\n\nWith dense indigenous Maya populations, Yucat\u00e1n's [[encomienda]] system was established early and persisted far longer than in central Mexico, since fewer Spaniards migrated to the region than in the center.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Although Yucat\u00e1n was a more peripheral area to the colony, since it lacked rich mining areas and no agricultural or other export product, it did have complex of Spanish settlement, with a whole range of social types in the main settlements of M\u00e9rida and the villas of Campeche and Valladolid.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=33\u201351}}</ref> There was an important sector of mixed-race [[castas]], some of whom were fully at home in both the indigenous and Hispanic worlds. Blacks were an important component of Yucatecan society.<ref>{{harvp|Restall|2009}}</ref> The largest population in the province was indigenous Maya, who lived in their communities, but which were in contact with the Hispanic sphere via labor demands and commerce.<ref>{{harvp|Hunt|1976|pp=42\u201346}}</ref>\n\nIn Yucat\u00e1n, Spanish rule was largely indirect, allowing these communities considerable political and cultural autonomy. The Maya community, the ''cah'', was the means by which indigenous cultural integrity was maintained. In the economic sphere, unlike many other regions and ethnic groups in Mesoamerica, the Yucatec Maya did not have a pre-conquest network of regular markets to exchange different types of food and craft goods. Perhaps because the peninsula was uniform in its ecosystem local niche production did not develop.<ref>{{harvp|Restall|1997|p=185}}</ref> Production of cotton textiles, largely by Maya women, helped pay households' tribute obligations, but basic crops were the basis of the economy. The cah retained considerable land under the control of religious brotherhoods or confraternities (''cofrad\u00edas''), the device by which Maya communities avoided colonial officials, the clergy, or even indigenous rulers (''gobernadores'') from diverting of community revenues in their ''cajas de comunidad'' (literally community-owned chests that had locks and keys). Cofrad\u00edas were traditionally lay pious organizations and burial societies, but in Yucat\u00e1n they became significant holders of land, a source of revenue for pious purposes kept under cah control. \"[I]n Yucat\u00e1n the cofrad\u00eda in its modified form was the community.\"<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=266}}</ref> Local Spanish clergy had no reason to object to the arrangement since much of the revenue went for payment for masses or other spiritual matters controlled by the priest.\n\nA limiting factor in Yucat\u00e1n's economy was the poorness of the limestone soil, which could only support crops for two to three years with land cleared through slash and burn (swidden) agriculture. Access to water was a limiting factor on agriculture, with the limestone escarpment giving way in water filled sinkholes (''cenotes''), but rivers and streams were generally absent on the peninsula. Individuals had rights to land so long as they cleared and tilled them and when the soil was exhausted, they repeated the process. In general, the Indians lived in a dispersed pattern, which Spanish ''congregaci\u00f3n'' or forced resettlement attempted to alter. Collective labor cultivated the confraternities' lands, which included raising the traditional maize, beans, and cotton. But confraternities also later pursued cattle ranching, as well as mule and horse breeding, depending on the local situation. There is evidence that cofrad\u00edas in southern Campeche were involved in interregional trade in cacao as well as cattle ranching.<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=267}}</ref> Although generally the revenues from crops and animals were devoted to expenses in the spiritual sphere, cofrad\u00edas' cattle were used for direct aid to community members during droughts, stabilizing the community's food supply.<ref>{{harvp|Farriss|1984|p=270}}</ref>\n\nIn the seventeenth century, patterns shifted in Yucat\u00e1n and Tabasco, as the English took territory the Spanish claimed but did not control, especially what became British Honduras (now Belize), where they cut dyewood and in Laguna de T\u00e9rminos (Isla del Carmen) where they cut logwood. In 1716\u201317 viceroy of New Spain organized a sufficient ships to expel the foreigners, where the crown subsequently built a fortress at Isla del Carmen.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|pp=50\u201352}}</ref> But the British held onto their territory in the eastern portion of the peninsula into the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the enclave supplied guns to the rebellious Maya in the [[Caste War of Yucatan]].<ref>{{harvp|Reed|1964}}</ref>\n\n====Valley of Oaxaca====\n[[Image:SantoDomingo12-05Oaxaca109.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n (Oaxaca)|Church of Santo Domingo]], [[Oaxaca City]]]]\nSince [[Oaxaca]] was lacking in mineral deposits and it had an abundant sedentary indigenous population, its development was notable for the lack of European or mixed-race population, lack of large-scale Spanish haciendas, and the survival of indigenous communities. These communities retained their land, indigenous languages, and distinct ethnic identities. [[Antequera]] (now Oaxaca City) was a Spanish settlement founded in 1529, but the rest of Oaxaca consisted of indigenous towns. Despite its remoteness from Mexico City, \"throughout the colonial era, Oaxaca was one of Mexico's most prosperous provinces.\"<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|p=186}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Brian R.

Cochineal's commodity chain is an interesting one, with indigenous peasants in the remote areas of Oaxaca ultimately linked to Amsterdam and London commodity exchanges and the European production of luxury cloth.<ref>{{harvp|Marichal|2006}}</ref> The most extensive scholarly work on Oaxaca's eighteenth-century economy deals with the nexus between the local crown officials (alcaldes mayores), merchant investors (''aviadores''), the repartimiento (forced labor), and indigenous products, particularly cochineal. The rich, color-fast red dye produced from insects, was harvested from [[nopal cacti]]. Cochineal was a high-value, low-volume product that became the second-most valuable Mexican export after silver. Although it could be produced elsewhere in central and southern Mexico, its main region of production was Oaxaca. For the indigenous in Oaxaca, cochineal was the only one \"with which the [tributaries] maintain themselves and pay their debts\" but it also had other advantages for them.{{#tag:ref|Baskes suggests the crown restricted its production to Oaxaca until 1819, which likely contributed to artificially high prices.<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|p=185}}</ref>|group=Note}} Producing cochineal was time-consuming labor, but it was not particularly difficult and could be done by the elderly, women, and children.<ref>{{harvp|Chance|1989|p=121}}</ref> It was also important to households and communities because it initially did not require the indigenous to displace their existing crops or migrate elsewhere.<ref>{{harvp|Baskes|2000|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the repartimiento has historically been seen as an imposition on the indigenous, forcing them into economic relations they would rather have avoided and maintained by force,<ref>For instance, {{harvp|Chance|1989|pp=121\u2013122}}.</ref> recent work on eighteenth-century Oaxaca analyzes the nexus of crown officials (the alcaldes mayores) and Spanish merchants, and indigenous via the repartimiento. cash loaned by local crown officials (the alcalde mayor and his teniente), usually to individual Indians but sometimes to communities, in exchange for a fixed amount of a good (cochineal or cotton mantles) at a later date. Indigenous elites were an integral part of the repartimiento, often being recipients of large extensions of credit. As authority figures in their community, they were in a good position to collect on the debt, the most risky part of the business from the Spanish point of view.\n\n====Tehuantepec====\nThe Isthmus of [[Tehuantepec]] region of Oaxaca was important for its short transit between the Gulf Coast and the Pacific, facilitating both overland and sea trade. The province of Tehuantepec was the Pacific side of the isthmus and the headwaters of the Coatzacoalcos River.<ref name=\"Gerhard_264\">{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=264}}</ref> [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] acquired strategically located holdings entailed in the Marquesado including Huatulco,{{#tag:ref|The crown did not wish to have the main west coast port in private hands and an agreement was worked out with Cort\u00e9s heir, Don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, to relinquish the Tehuantepec encomienda.<ref>{{harvp|Gerhard|1993|p=265}}.</ref>|group=Note}} once the main Pacific Coast port before [[Acapulco]] replaced it in 1563.\n\nGold mining was an early draw for Spaniards, who directed indigenous labor to its extraction, but did not continue beyond the mid-sixteenth century. Over the long run, ranching and commerce were the most important economic activities, with the settlement of Tehuantepec becoming the hub. The region's history can be divided into three distinct periods, an initial period of engagement with Spanish colonial rule to 1563, during which there was a working relationship with the Zapotec ruling line and the establishment of Cort\u00e9s's economic enterprises. This early period came to a close with the death of the last native king in 1562 and the escheatment of Cort\u00e9s's Tehuantepec encomiendas to the crown in 1563. The second period of approximately a century (1563\u20131660) saw the decline of the indigenous entailed estate (''cacicazgo'') and indigenous political power and development of the colonial economy and imposition of Spanish political and religious structures. The final period is the maturation of these structures (1660\u20131750). The 1660 rebellion can be a dividing line between the two later periods.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|2005|pp=xiv\u2013xv}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of [[Tehuantepec]], the largest settlement on the isthmus, was an important prehispanic Zapotec trade and religious center, which was not under the jurisdiction of the Aztecs.<ref name=\"Gerhard_264\"/> The early colonial history of Tehuantepec and the larger province was dominated by Cort\u00e9s and the Marquesado, but the crown realized the importance of the area and concluded an agreement in 1563 with the second Marqu\u00e9s by which the crown took control of the Tehuantepec encomienda. The Marquesado continued to have major private holdings in the province. The Villa of Tehuantepec became a center of Spanish and mixed-race settlement, crown administration, and trade.\n\nThe Cort\u00e9s haciendas in Tehuantepec were key components of the province's economy, and they were directly linked to other Marquesado enterprises in greater Mexico in an integrated fashion.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989}}</ref> The Dominicans also had significant holdings in Tehuantepec, but there has been little research on these. However important the Marquesado and the Dominican enterprises were, there were also other economic players in the region, including individual Spaniards as well as existing indigenous communities. Ranching emerged as the dominant rural enterprise in most of Tehuantepec with a ranching boom in the period 1580\u20131640. Since Tehuantepec experienced significant indigenous population loss in the sixteenth century conforming to the general pattern, ranching made possible for Spaniards to thrive in Tehuantepec because ranching was not dependent on significant amounts of indigenous labor.<ref name=\"Zeitlin_1989\">{{harvp|Zeitlin|1989}}</ref>\n\nThe most detailed economic records for the region are of the Marquesado's ranching haciendas, which produced draft animals (horses, mules, burros, and oxen) and sheep and goats, for meat and wool. Cattle ranching for meat, tallow, and leather were also important. Tallow for candles used in churches and residences and leather used in a variety of ways (saddles, other tack, boots, furniture, machinery) were significant items in the larger colonial economy, finding markets well beyond Tehuantepec. Since the Marquesado operated as an integrated enterprise, draft animals were used in other holdings for transport, agriculture, and mining in Oaxaca, Morelos, Toluca, and Mexico City as well as sold. Raised in Tehuantepec, the animals were driven to other Marquesado holdings for use and distribution.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=9}}</ref>\n\nAlthough colonial population decline affected the indigenous in Tehuantepec, their communities remained important in the colonial era and remain distinctly Indian to the current era. There were differences in the three distinct linguistic and ethnic groups in colonial Tehuantepec, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], the [[Zoque people|Zoque]], and the [[Huave]]. The Zapotecs concluded an alliance with the Spaniards at contact, and they had already expanded their territory into Zoque and Huave regions.\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the Zapotecs not only survived, but flourished, unlike the other two. They continued to pursue agriculture, some of it irrigated, which was not disrupted by the growing ranching economy. Generally Zapotec elites protected their communities from Spanish incursions and community cohesion remained strong as shown in members' performance of regular community service for social ends. Zapotec elites engaged in the market economy early on, which undermined to an extent the bonds between commoners and elites who colluded with the Spanish. In contrast to the Zapotecs, the Zoque generally declined as a group during the ranching boom, with interloping animals eating their maize crops. Zoque response was to take up being vaqueros themselves. They had access to the trade to Guatemala. Of the three indigenous groups, the Huave were the most isolated from the Spanish ranching economy and labor demands.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|1989|p=55}}</ref> With little arable or grazing land, they exploited the lagoons of the Pacific coast, using shore and beach resources. They traded dried shrimp and fish, as well as purple dye from shells to Oaxaca, likely acquiring foodstuffs that they were unable to cultivate themselves.<ref name=\"Zeitlin_1989\"/>\n\nNot well documented is the number of African slaves and their descendants, who were artisans in urban areas and did hard manual labor in rural areas.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=15}}</ref> In a pattern recognizable elsewhere, coastal populations were mainly African, including an unknown number of [[cimarr\u00f3nes|cimarr\u00f3n]] (runaway slave) settlements, while inland the indigenous communities were more prominent. On the Cort\u00e9s haciendas, blacks and mulattoes were essential to the profitability of the enterprises.<ref>{{harvp|Guti\u00e9rrez Brockington|1989|p=16}}</ref>\n\nIn general, Tehuantepec was not a site of major historical events, but in 1660\u201361, there was a significant rebellion stemming from increased repartimiento Spanish demands.<ref>{{harvp|Zeitlin|2005|loc=esp.

The region was diverse, and outlying provinces were resentful for elites in capital of [[Antigua Guatemala]], destroyed by an earthquake in 1773. There was a high court [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] in the Kingdom of Guatemala. Given the region's distance from major centers of power in New Spain and Spain itself, local strongmen in the early were only nominally subject to royal authority. The indigenous population was very large in comparison to the Spanish, and there were relatively few Africans. Spaniards continued to employ forced labor in the region starting with the conquest era and exact tribute from the indigenous.<ref>Sherman, William L. ''Forced Native Labor in Sixteenth-Century Central America''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1979.</ref> Compared to the mining areas of New Spain's North, this region was generally poor in mineral resources, although Honduras had a brief boom in gold mining, and in the colonial period had little potential to develop an export product, except for [[Cocoa bean|cacao]] and the blue dye [[indigo]].<ref>[[Murdo J. MacLeod|MacLeod, Murdo J.]], ''Spanish Central America: A Socioeconomic History, 1520\u20131720''. Berkeley: University of California Press 1973.</ref> Cacao had been cultivated in the prehispanic period. Orchards of cacao trees, which took a number of years to come to maturity and produce fruit. Cacao boomed in the late sixteenth century, and then was displaced by indigo as the most important export product.  Indigo, like cacao, was native to the region, and the indigenous peoples gathered wild indigo, used for dying cloth and as a trade good. After the arrival of the Spanish, they domesticated indigo and created plantations for its cultivation in Yucatan, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The indigo industry thrived, since there was high demand in Europe for a high quality, color-fast blue dye. In the region, cultivation and processing was done by indigenous workers, but the owners of plantations, ''a\u00f1ileros'', were Spanish. It was a dangerous work environment, with toxins present in the indigo plants that sickened and sometimes killed workers. It was profitable, especially following the [[Bourbon Reforms]], which allowed trade within the Spanish empire. In the late eighteenth century, indigo growers organized in a trade organization, the ''Consulado de Comercio''.<ref>Woodward, Ralph Lee. ''Class Privilege and Economic Development: The Consulado de Comercio of Guatemala, 1793\u20131871''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1966.</ref> There were regions that were not subjugated to Spanish rule, such as the [[Pet\u00e9n Department|Pet\u00e9n]] and the [[Mosquito Coast]], and the English took advantage of weak Spanish control to establish a commercial presence on the Gulf Coast, later seizing [[Belize]]. An American-born Spanish elite (''criollos'') accumulated land and built fortunes on wheat, sugar, and cattle, all of which were consumed within the region.<ref>Webre, Stephen. \"Audiencia of Guatemala\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 3, pp.130\u201331. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===The role of epidemics===\n[[File:FlorentineCodex BK12 F54 smallpox.jpg|thumb|right|Nahua depiction of [[smallpox]], Book XII on the conquest of Mexico in the [[Florentine Codex]] (1576)]]\nSpanish settlers brought to the American continent [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], and other infectious diseases. Most of the Spanish settlers had developed an immunity to these diseases from childhood, but the indigenous peoples lacked the needed [[antibodies]] since these diseases were totally alien to the native population at the time. There were at least three separate, major epidemics that decimated the population: smallpox (1520 to 1521), measles (1545 to 1548) and typhus (1576 to 1581). In the course of the 16th century, the native population in Mexico went from an estimated pre-Columbian population of 8 to 20 million to less than two million. Therefore, at the start of the 17th century, continental New Spain was a depopulated country with abandoned cities and [[maize]] fields. These diseases would not affect the Philippines in the same way because the diseases were already present in the country; Pre-Hispanic Filipinos had contact with other foreign nationalities before the arrival of the Spaniards.\n\n===The role of interracial mixing===\n{{Main|Casta}}\n[[File:Castas 01mestiza max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Indian woman, Mestiza. [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], Mexico 1763.]]\n[[File:Castas 04mulata max.jpg|thumb|From Spaniard and Black woman, [[Mulatto]]. Miguel Cabrera.]]\nFollowing the Spanish conquests, new labels for racial categories were created, primary among them the [[Mestizo]], the offspring of a Spaniard and an ''India''. The Mestizo population emerged as a result of the Spanish colonizers having children with indigenous women, both within and outside of wedlock, which brought about the mixing of both cultures.\n\nInitially, if a child was born in wedlock, the child was considered, and raised as, a member of the prominent parent's ethnicity. (''See [[Hyperdescent]] and [[Hypodescent]].'') Because of this, the term \"Mestizo\" was associated with illegitimacy. Mestizos do not appear in large numbers in official censuses until the second half of the 17th century, when a sizable and stable community of mixed-race people with no claims to being either Indian or Spanish appeared, although, of course, a large population of biological Mestizos had already existed for over a century in Mexico.\n\nThe Spanish conquest also brought the migration of people of African descent to the many regions of the Viceroyalty. Some came as [[Juan Garrido|free blacks]], but vast majority came because of the introduction of [[Atlantic slave trade|African slavery]]. As the native population was decimated by epidemics and forced labor, black slaves were imported. Mixes with Europeans and indigenous peoples also occurred, resulting in the creation of new racial categories such as [[Mulatto]]s and [[Zambo]]s to account for these offspring. As with the term Mestizo, these other terms were associated with illegitimacy, since a majority\u2014though not all\u2014of these people were born outside of wedlock.\n\nEventually a [[caste]] system was created to describe the various mixes and to assign them a different social level. In theory, each different mix had a name and different sets of privileges or prohibitions. In reality, mixed-race people were able to negotiate various racial and ethnic identities (often several ones at different points in their lives) depending on the family ties and wealth they had. In its general outline, the system reflected reality. The upper echelons of government were staffed by Spaniards born in Spain (''[[peninsulares]]''), the middle and lower levels of government and other higher paying jobs were held by [[Criollo (people)|Criollo]]s (Criollos were Spaniards born in the Americas, or\u2014as permitted by the ''casta'' system\u2014Spaniards with some [[Amerindian]] or even other ancestry.)<ref>{{harvp|Carrera|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> The best lands were owned by Peninsulares and Criollos, with Native communities for the most part relegated to marginal lands. Mestizos and Mulattos held [[artisan]]al positions and unskilled laborers were either more mixed people, such as [[Zambo]]s, recently freed slaves or Natives who had left their communities and settled in areas with large [[Hispanic]] populations. Native populations tended to have their own legally recognized communities (the ''rep\u00fablicas de indios'') with their own social and economic hierarchies. This rough sketch must be complicated by the fact that not only did exceptions exist, but also that all these \"racial\" categories represented social conventions, as demonstrated by the fact that many persons were assigned a caste based on hyperdescent or hypodescent.\n\nEven if mixes were common, the white population tried to keep their higher status, and were largely successful in doing so. With Mexican and Central American independence, the caste system and slavery were theoretically abolished. However, historians have noted that the Criollos simply replaced the [[Peninsulares]] in terms of power and \"ethnic inequality\" in Mexico continued in the post-independence period.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Identity and Activism|last=Linares|first=Federico Navarette|publisher=Shipra Publications|year=2009|location=New Delhi|pages=55\u201356|chapter=Crisis and Reinvention: The Redefinition of Indigenous Identities in Contemporary Mexico}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Mexico and the United States|last=Campbell|first=Andrew|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corp|year=2002|isbn=9780761474036|editor-last=Stacy|editor-first=Lee|pages=245\u2013246}}</ref> As a result of \"mestizaje\" and [[Indigenismo in Mexico|Indigenista]] policies implemented by the Mexican government in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, \"Mestizo\" soon became a cultural term meant to homogenize the Mexican population, including everyone from Indigenous people who had been [[Detribalization|detribalized]] or abandoned their traditional ways, to \"westernized urban elites, traditional peasant communities, Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Atheists, and the widely varying regional cultures of Mexico.\" As such, the term has been criticized as \"problematic,\" since it has been noted that \"the only trait shared by all Mestizos is the fact that they do not consider themselves Indians.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Identity and Activism|last=Linares|first=Federico Navarette|publisher=Shipra Publications|year=2009|location=New Delhi|pages=61|chapter=Crisis and Reinvention: The Redefinition of Indigenous Identities in Contemporary Mexico}}</ref>\n\n===Population in early 1800s===\n[[File:Mapa del Virreinato de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a (1819).svg|thumb|upright=1.5|New Spain in 1819 with the boundaries established at the [[Adams-On\u00eds Treaty]]]]\nWhile different intendencies would perform censuses to get a detailed insight in regards to its inhabitants (namely occupation, number of persons per household, ethnicity etc.), it was until 1793 that the results of the first ever national census would be published. The census is also known as the \"Revillagigedo census\" because its creation was ordered by the Count of the same name. Most of the census' original datasets have reportedly been lost; thus most of what is known about it nowadays comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works, such as Prussian geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Each author gives different estimations for the total population, ranging from 3,799,561 to 6,122,354<ref>{{harvp|Navarro y Noriega|1820}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|von Humboldt|1811}}</ref> (more recent data suggests that the actual population of New Spain in 1810 was closer to 5 or 5.5 million individuals)<ref>{{harvp|McCaa|2000}}</ref> as well as the ethnic composition in the country although there isn't much variation, with Europeans ranging from 18% to 22% of New Spain's population, Mestizos ranging from 21% to 25%, Indians ranging from 51% to 61% and Africans being between 6,000 and 10,000. It is concluded then, that across nearly three centuries of colonization, the population growth trends of whites and mestizos were even, while the total percentage of the indigenous population decreased at a rate of 13%\u201317% per century. The authors assert that rather than whites and mestizos having higher birthrates, the reason for the indigenous population's numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates, due to living in remote locations rather than in cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them. It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications, as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted, leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others.<ref name=\"Lerner1968\">{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Victoria|title=Consideraciones sobre la poblaci\u00f3n de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a: 1793\u20131810, seg\u00fan Humboldt y Navarro y Noriega|trans-title=Considerations on the population of New Spain: 1793\u20131810, according to Humboldt and Navarro and Noriega|language=es|url=http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf|year=1968|pages=328\u2013348|accessdate=24 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731104825/http://aleph.org.mx/jspui/bitstream/56789/29809/1/17-067-1968-0327.pdf|archive-date=31 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Intendecy/territory\n!European population (%)\n!Indigenous population (%)\n!Mestizo population (%)\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[State of Mexico|M\u00e9xico]] (only [[State of Mexico]] and capital)\n| 16.9%\n| 66.1%\n| 16.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Puebla]]\n| 10.1%\n| 74.3%\n| 15.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Oaxaca]]\n| 06.3%\n| 88.2%\n| 05.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guanajuato]]\n| 25.8%\n| 44.0%\n| 29.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n| 13.0%\n| 51.2%\n| 35.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Zacatecas]]\n| 15.8%\n| 29.0%\n| 55.1%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Durango]]\n| 20.2%\n| 36.0%\n| 43.5%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Sonora]]\n| 28.5%\n| 44.9%\n| 26.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Yucat\u00e1n]]\n| 14.8%\n| 72.6%\n| 12.3%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Guadalajara]]\n| 31.7%\n| 33.3%\n| 34.7%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Veracruz]]\n| 10.4%\n| 74.0%\n| 15.2%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Michoacan|Valladolid]]\n| 27.6%\n| 42.5%\n| 29.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[New Mexico|Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]\n|  ~\n| 30.8%\n| 69.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Baja California|Vieja California]]\n|  ~\n| 51.7%\n| 47.9%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Alta California|Nueva California]]\n|   ~\n| 89.9%\n| 09.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Coahuila]]\n| 30.9%\n| 28.9%\n| 40.0%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n| 62.6%\n| 05.5%\n| 31.6%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Nuevo Santander]]\n| 25.8%\n| 23.3%\n| 50.8%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Texas]]\n| 39.7%\n| 27.3%\n| 32.4%\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| [[Tlaxcala]]\n| 13.6%\n| 72.4%\n| 13.8%\n|-\n|}\n~<small>Europeans are included within the Mestizo category.</small>\n\nRegardless of the possible imprecision related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside of the colonized areas, the effort that New Spain's authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning, as censuses made by other colonial or post-colonial countries did not consider American Indians to be citizens/subjects, as example the censuses made by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements.<ref name=scarecrow>''Historical Dictionary of Argentina''.

Some of the most important early buildings in New Spain were churches and other religious architecture. Civil architecture included the viceregal palace, now the National Palace, and the Mexico City town council (''cabildo''), both located on the main square in the capital.\n\nThe [[House of the First Print Shop in the Americas|first printing press in the New World]] was brought to Mexico in 1539, by printer [[Juan Pablos]] (Giovanni Paoli).

Hurley writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nMethods of shillelagh fighting have evolved over a period of thousands of years, from the spear, staff, axe and sword fighting of the Irish. There is some evidence which suggests that the use of Irish stick weapons may have evolved in a progression from a reliance on long spears and [[wattles]], to shorter spears and wattles, to the shillelagh, alpeen,{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|There is only a vague distinction between shillelagh and alpeen (Diarmaid \u00d3 Muirithe), though the alpeen may be longer or heavier, and be knobbed in the minds of some ([[P.

Modern practitioners of [[bataireacht]] study the use of the shillelagh for self-defense and as a [[martial art]]. Of the practice, researcher J. W. Hurley writes:\n\n<blockquote>\nMethods of shillelagh fighting have evolved over a period of thousands of years, from the spear, staff, axe and sword fighting of the Irish. There is some evidence which suggests that the use of Irish stick weapons may have evolved in a progression from a reliance on long spears and [[wattles]], to shorter spears and wattles, to the shillelagh, alpeen,{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|There is only a vague distinction between shillelagh and alpeen (Diarmaid \u00d3 Muirithe), though the alpeen may be longer or heavier, and be knobbed in the minds of some ([[P.
