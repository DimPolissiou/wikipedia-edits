A [[resistor]] would be a reduced diameter somewhere in the piping and a [[capacitor]]/[[inductor]] could be likened to a \"U\" shaped pipe where a higher water level on one side could store energy temporarily.\n\nThe relationship between voltage and current is defined (in ohmic devices like [[resistor]]s) by [[Ohm's law]].

Located in [[Rabat]] and created in 1961, its latest naming has changed by Royal Decree from the appellation ''The Training Centre of Engineers in Statistics'' in 1967 with the support of the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] (ECA).\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nINSEA provides training that gives equal weight to the [[statistics]] and [[economic]] analysis, and offers a specialization in the fields of [[computing]], [[finance]] and the [[actuarial]], [[demographic]] and [[operations research]]. This is the first school that offered training in computers at the national level and has developed the first computer to the kingdom and in the 1974.\n\nThe INSEA graduates have skills that allow them to perform the analysis and [[economic forecasting]], the [[engineering]] of [[information systems]] and statistical expertise, but they are also capable of develop [[Economic model|models]] to improve the sophisticated market analysis, refine the target [[marketing]], and measure the [[risk]] in a variety of areas.\n\nFurthermore, the training INSEA not limited to technical aspects of design, but also extends to the [[management]], the [[communication]] and good knowledge of the socio-economic and political environment.\nGraduates of INSEA are expected to play a strategic role at various stages of the process of economic and social development, pursuing careers in the public sector, local communities and the private sector: [[bank]] [[companies' Insurance]] and large [[companies]] and national [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s.\n\nThe Institute is under the supervision of the [[High Commissioner for Planning]], National Board of Economic Planning of the country.\n\n== Specializations and careers ==\n\n;Statistics\n\nStatistics is the study of observations, its application areas are numerous and diverse, in fact almost all areas that lend themselves to numerical observations may be privileged fields of application.\nAn INSEAist statistician engineer may have different tasks: it is frequently entrusted with the planning of a full statistical study with constraints and objectives to meet. It must determine the number of observations necessary for the conclusions can be expressed with a level of certainty. It must, with experts in the field of study, discuss the variables mesurer.Il must explain the results of statistical analysis and specify, if necessary, restrictions on the conclusions given the methods and level of uncertainty present.\nThe engineering statistician can play the role of associate and / or consultant, he is also invited, on occasion, to play the role of expert. His expertise is often ad hoc, but still very important for the decision maker.\nIt may possibly be a member of a team of industrial production, collaboration is then as a specialist in quality assurance and reliability. The experimental research centers routinely use the statisticians.\n\n;Applied Economics\n\nINSEA aims to train engineers for economists to engage in professional activities in the specialized services of private or public companies, financial sectors, international organizations and national or regional communities. The Engineering Economist has three main roles: researcher, interpreter and adviser. Analysis of vacancies released four major categories of posts for engineers economists: economic analysis and forecasting company is to develop tools that support the decision to develop the strategy development of the business analysis of economic information in the company through economic studies, statistical studies of economic organization in a study such as quantitative and / or qualitative study or as a macro and micro economic public agency. For example, economic diagnosis prior to a public intervention, special study for a local authority before an operation of urbanization.\n\n;Computer Science\n\nIn the perspectives to contribute to good business efficiency in the institutional domain, INSEA form of computer engineers from state to apply in the field of business management and help the organization and operation.\nAn engineer who holds a diploma in computer INSEA is capable of handling analysis, design, development and piloting information systems, control and implement the tools to achieve computerized information system. acquire a conceptual vision in a multidisciplinary environment at both strategic and operational levels and also develop strong skills in business management from a practical approach.\nFor outlets, a state engineer may be a computer systems architect information, a database administrator, an engineer in business management ...\n\n;Actuarial Sciences and Finance\n\nThe rapid development of financial markets worldwide, has expanded considerably to the theory of finance, so the banking, insurance and large companies need \"experts\" in this field.\nIn this perspective, INSEA began training engineers actuarial funding status since 1998, engineers familiar with the new financial theories, while mastering tools, mathematics and statistics at top level.\nA state engineer holds a Diploma in Actuarial INSEA-finance can work in multiple markets such as market operators: they take positions and manage mission-oriented investment, hedging or speculation on behalf of institutions or customers; official who follows the market activities and control risk; fund manager: making investment choices, or take positions to ensure better use of the wallet, within the constraints of legislation and contracts spent with clients, managing assets / liabilities: Advisor of the Directorate General in the asset and liabilities, or organizer: adaptation and modernization of tools and methods.\n\n;Operational Research\n\nOperations research is the application of scientific method to master the complex problems encountered in the direction and management systems in industry, commerce and administration. The aim is to take an aid to decision making. The curriculum at INSEA attempts to provide both: a preparation for life in Operations Research, research and preparation of OR in the following areas: Combinatorial optimization, Graphs and Combinatorics and Discrete Mathematics.\nThrough cross-training acquired in INSEA, the engineer in OR is as much an expert analysis of organizational processes and phenomena that specializes in the management, design and operation of systems information.\nIt can therefore work in the following areas: computerization of a business information management (job description), analysis of financial flows (work schedule), designing databases, development of Master Plan (quality control ) management of telecommunications (forecast) and also in the system design decision support (inventory management).\n\n== Student life ==\n\nINSEA offers students a residence with a capacity of 670 persons (290 in Buildings A and B, 240 in buildings C and D and 140 provided in the building E).

Located in [[Rabat]] and created in 1961, its latest naming has changed by Royal Decree from the appellation ''The Training Centre of Engineers in Statistics'' in 1967 with the support of the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] (ECA).\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nINSEA provides training that gives equal weight to the [[statistics]] and [[economic]] analysis, and offers a specialization in the fields of [[computing]], [[finance]] and the [[actuarial]], [[demographic]] and [[operations research]]. This is the first school that offered training in computers at the national level and has developed the first computer to the kingdom and in the 1974.\n\nThe INSEA graduates have skills that allow them to perform the analysis and [[economic forecasting]], the [[engineering]] of [[information systems]] and statistical expertise, but they are also capable of develop [[Economic model|models]] to improve the sophisticated market analysis, refine the target [[marketing]], and measure the [[risk]] in a variety of areas.\n\nFurthermore, the training INSEA not limited to technical aspects of design, but also extends to the [[management]], the [[communication]] and good knowledge of the socio-economic and political environment.\nGraduates of INSEA are expected to play a strategic role at various stages of the process of economic and social development, pursuing careers in the public sector, local communities and the private sector: [[bank]] [[companies' Insurance]] and large [[companies]] and national [[multinational corporation|multinational]]s.\n\nThe Institute is under the supervision of the [[High Commissioner for Planning]], National Board of Economic Planning of the country.\n\n== Specializations and careers ==\n\n;Statistics\n\nStatistics is the study of observations, its application areas are numerous and diverse, in fact almost all areas that lend themselves to numerical observations may be privileged fields of application.\nAn INSEAist statistician engineer may have different tasks: it is frequently entrusted with the planning of a full statistical study with constraints and objectives to meet. It must determine the number of observations necessary for the conclusions can be expressed with a level of certainty. It must, with experts in the field of study, discuss the variables mesurer.Il must explain the results of statistical analysis and specify, if necessary, restrictions on the conclusions given the methods and level of uncertainty present.\nThe engineering statistician can play the role of associate and / or consultant, he is also invited, on occasion, to play the role of expert. His expertise is often ad hoc, but still very important for the decision maker.\nIt may possibly be a member of a team of industrial production, collaboration is then as a specialist in quality assurance and reliability. The experimental research centers routinely use the statisticians.\n\n;Applied Economics\n\nINSEA aims to train engineers for economists to engage in professional activities in the specialized services of private or public companies, financial sectors, international organizations and national or regional communities. The Engineering Economist has three main roles: researcher, interpreter and adviser. Analysis of vacancies released four major categories of posts for engineers economists: economic analysis and forecasting company is to develop tools that support the decision to develop the strategy development of the business analysis of economic information in the company through economic studies, statistical studies of economic organization in a study such as quantitative and / or qualitative study or as a macro and micro economic public agency. For example, economic diagnosis prior to a public intervention, special study for a local authority before an operation of urbanization.\n\n;Computer Science\n\nIn the perspectives to contribute to good business efficiency in the institutional domain, INSEA form of computer engineers from state to apply in the field of business management and help the organization and operation.\nAn engineer who holds a diploma in computer INSEA is capable of handling analysis, design, development and piloting information systems, control and implement the tools to achieve computerized information system. acquire a conceptual vision in a multidisciplinary environment at both strategic and operational levels and also develop strong skills in business management from a practical approach.\nFor outlets, a state engineer may be a computer systems architect information, a database administrator, an engineer in business management ...\n\n;Actuarial Sciences and Finance\n\nThe rapid development of financial markets worldwide, has expanded considerably to the theory of finance, so the banking, insurance and large companies need \"experts\" in this field.\nIn this perspective, INSEA began training engineers actuarial funding status since 1998, engineers familiar with the new financial theories, while mastering tools, mathematics and statistics at top level.\nA state engineer holds a Diploma in Actuarial INSEA-finance can work in multiple markets such as market operators: they take positions and manage mission-oriented investment, hedging or speculation on behalf of institutions or customers; official who follows the market activities and control risk; fund manager: making investment choices, or take positions to ensure better use of the wallet, within the constraints of legislation and contracts spent with clients, managing assets / liabilities: Advisor of the Directorate General in the asset and liabilities, or organizer: adaptation and modernization of tools and methods.\n\n;Operational Research\n\nOperations research is the application of scientific method to master the complex problems encountered in the direction and management systems in industry, commerce and administration.

The idea of a national theatre training school was initiated by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (AETT) in the mid-1950s. With the support of the then Vice-Chancellor (later Sir) Philip Baxter, NIDA was established in the grounds of the University of New South Wales.\u00a0 Robert Quentin, later Professor of Drama at UNSW, was appointed the inaugural Director.\n\nTeaching began in 1959 and in 1960, the first 23 students graduated with a Diploma in Acting; today, NIDA welcomes over 200 full-time students to the Kensington campus, more than 12,500 NIDA Open participants from across Australia take part in part-time and short classes, and 2,900 clients attend NIDA Corporate's training for professionals each year.\n\nFrom 1961 it offered both acting and production streams, and in the early 1970s design, technical production and directing streams were introduced. In 1991 NIDA expanded into the study of theatrical crafts \u2013 costume, properties, scenery and staging - and over the 2000s developed post-graduate courses in voice, movement studies, production management and playwriting. The current courses in six undergraduate, five post-graduate and four vocational diploma disciplines reflect NIDA's ongoing responsiveness to industry demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nida.edu.au/about-nida/history:|title=NIDA.edu.au: History}}</ref>\n\n==Admission==\nEntry to NIDA's Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Vocational courses is competitive, with more than 1,500 applicants from around the country competing for an annual offering of approximately 185 places across the six undergraduate, five post-graduate and four vocational diploma disciplines.\n\nNIDA's Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting is particularly competitive, with approximately 1,000 applicants per year attempting to secure one of 24 spots in the program.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Campus==\nNIDA is located on [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], across the road from the [[University of New South Wales]]. The campus was first opened in 1987, followed by additional buildings opened in 2001, which were awarded the 2002 [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] for public architecture.\n\n===Theatres===\nThe NIDA campus has six professional performance venues,<ref>https://www.nida.edu.au/venue-spaces</ref> in addition to studios and rehearsal rooms. As the largest of the performance venues at NIDA, the Parade Theatre offers seating for audiences of up to 709 people in its three-tiered, horseshoe-shaped auditorium. The Playhouse is a 155-seat amphitheatre, designed for more intimate productions. NIDA has three smaller black box theatres \u2013 the Space, the Studio Theatre and the Reg Grundy Studio \u2013 that are frequently adapted to suit different production needs.\n\n===Library===\nThe Rodney Seaborn Library is a specialist library for NIDA students, graduates and staff and is also open to the general public by appointment. Created in 1980.\n\nThe NIDA Archives collects, organises and preserves archival records created by or relating to NIDA.\n\n===Other facilities===\nThe NIDA campus includes rehearsal rooms, multi-media and computer-aided design (CAD) studios, a sound stage, a lighting studio, production workshops, audio-visual facilities, and the Reg Grundy Studio film and television training and production facility.\n\n== Alumni ==\n{{Main category|National Institute of Dramatic Art alumni}}\nThe National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) is Australia's leading centre for education and training in the performing arts.

The idea of a national theatre training school was initiated by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (AETT) in the mid-1950s. With the support of the then Vice-Chancellor (later Sir) Philip Baxter, NIDA was established in the grounds of the University of New South Wales.\u00a0 Robert Quentin, later Professor of Drama at UNSW, was appointed the inaugural Director.\n\nTeaching began in 1959 and in 1960, the first 23 students graduated with a Diploma in Acting; today, NIDA welcomes over 200 full-time students to the Kensington campus, more than 12,500 NIDA Open participants from across Australia take part in part-time and short classes, and 2,900 clients attend NIDA Corporate's training for professionals each year.\n\nFrom 1961 it offered both acting and production streams, and in the early 1970s design, technical production and directing streams were introduced. In 1991 NIDA expanded into the study of theatrical crafts \u2013 costume, properties, scenery and staging - and over the 2000s developed post-graduate courses in voice, movement studies, production management and playwriting. The current courses in six undergraduate, five post-graduate and four vocational diploma disciplines reflect NIDA's ongoing responsiveness to industry demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nida.edu.au/about-nida/history:|title=NIDA.edu.au: History}}</ref>\n\n==Admission==\nEntry to NIDA's Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Vocational courses is competitive, with more than 1,500 applicants from around the country competing for an annual offering of approximately 185 places across the six undergraduate, five post-graduate and four vocational diploma disciplines.\n\nNIDA's Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting is particularly competitive, with approximately 1,000 applicants per year attempting to secure one of 24 spots in the program.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Campus==\nNIDA is located on [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]], across the road from the [[University of New South Wales]]. The campus was first opened in 1987, followed by additional buildings opened in 2001, which were awarded the 2002 [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] for public architecture.\n\n===Theatres===\nThe NIDA campus has six professional performance venues<ref>https://www.nida.edu.au/venue-spaces</ref> , in addition to studios and rehearsal rooms. As the largest of the performance venues at NIDA, the Parade Theatre offers seating for audiences of up to 709 people in its three-tiered, horseshoe-shaped auditorium. The Playhouse is a 155-seat amphitheatre, designed for more intimate productions. NIDA has three smaller black box theatres \u2013 the Space, the Studio Theatre and the Reg Grundy Studio \u2013 that are frequently adapted to suit different production needs. \n\n===Library===\nThe Rodney Seaborn Library is a specialist library for NIDA students, graduates and staff and is also open to the general public by appointment. Created in 1980.\n\nThe NIDA Archives collects, organises and preserves archival records created by or relating to NIDA.\n\n===Other facilities===\nThe NIDA campus includes rehearsal rooms, multi-media and computer-aided design (CAD) studios, a sound stage, a lighting studio, production workshops, audio-visual facilities, and the Reg Grundy Studio film and television training and production facility.\n\n== Alumni ==\n{{Main category|National Institute of Dramatic Art alumni}}\nThe [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA) is Australia's leading centre for education and training in the performing arts.

{"title_page": "Telugu folk literature", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Underlinked|date=November 2012}}\n{{Orphan|date=November 2012}}\n{{inadequate lead|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n\nIt is not easy to trace out the origins of the '''Telugu folk literature''', for that matter any [[folk literature]]. It is as difficult as to decide the origin of any language. In other words, one can argue that the origin and existence of any folk literature can be a parallel phenomenon along with that language. Because the folk expressive traditions of any ethnic group are much earlier than the language of that particular ethnic group. Need not say about the developed [[literature]] in written tradition. The [[Cave paintings in India|cave paintings]], line drawings found in different [[archeological sites]] prove the ability of the creative expressions of [[prehistoric]] human beings even before they were not able to speak. The addition of verbal creativity in latter periods has widened the folk expressive tradition in another medium that is verbal folk arts or the folk literature. Therefore, the existence of any folk literature can go back to the time of the given language correspondingly.\n\n==The origins of Telugu folk literature==\n[[Telugu language|Telugu]] is the most widely-spoken [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language on Earth and is spoken in all of [[Andhra Pradesh]]  in [[India]] and parts of other southern states as well. The history of Telugu goes back as early as to 230 BC to 225 AD,<ref>Krishnamoorty, B.H.1974:2</ref> and the evidence for the existence of [[Telugu language]] is available in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' of the [[Bharatha people]]. Even better evidence is shown from the inscription of Nandampudi written by none other than the first Telugu poet Nannya goes back to the 11th century AD.<ref>Krishnamoorty, B.H.1974:4</ref> The author of ''Samagrandhra Sahityam'' (''The Comprehensive history of Telugu Literature'') [[Aarudhra]] has developed a different kind of argument. He says the word \"naagabu\" is there in an inscription of the [[Amaravati Stupa]] Buddha Sthupa, built between 200 BC to 200 AD <ref>Arudra 1965:6</ref> the [[suffix]] of this word 'bu' is a typical Telugu suffix and it can not be there unless the language was considerably developed in spoken form. (He considered the word a sacred '[[mantra]]' and printed it on the top place of the cover page of his book). More reliable evidence for the existence of Telugu language were shown by him at least from 350 AD. Based on this evidence it is possible to come to a rough idea that the verbal expressive traditions of Telugus may be there even at the beginning of the [[common era]].\n\nIndisputable concrete historical evidence of Telugu folk literature is available in the poetical work, the [[Kum\u0101rasambhava]] by Nannechoda who belongs to the 11th and 12th centuries. He has mentioned different kinds of songs sung by different folk groups (goudu geetamulu or songs of gouds).<ref>Mahadeva Sastri, Korada (ed). 1968: 128-130</ref> Some more inscriptional evidences for the existence of folk literature are also available in the [[6th century AD]].<ref>Ramaraju, B 1968:46-48</ref> According to [[Ramaraju]] some of the prosodic structures, found in this period, very closely resemble to the metrical order of folk songs of modern times. The evidence may not clearly show a particular song or its existence but one cannot rule out the possible existence of folk literature even before this period as the evidence for the existence of [[Telugu language]] was there from much earlier period.\n\nMany traditional Telugu poetical works of earlier and medieval age, taking form the Palkuriki Somanadha's Basava Purana to the Yakshagana (written works) of Nayaka kings of the [[17th century]], have mentioned about different performing castes and performing traditions, which were living and moving in the Andhra desa i.e., the present Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==Taxonomy of Telugu folk literary genres==\nThe Telugu folk literature is so enormously rich that it contains all major categories of world folk literature. The folk literary categories, which were classified in various languages by the scholars across the world, can be found in the Telugu folk literature. Some unique kind of folk literary forms like [[Caste system in India|caste]] myth also can be found in it. It is very rich not only in terms of variety of genres but the enormous size of the repertoires of various performing castes and individual singers. Many scholars have already classified Telugu folk literature in different divisions and sub divisions in an efficient way depending on the material they have considered for the study.<ref>Krishna Kumari, N.1977: 19</ref><ref>Ramaraju, B.1978b</ref><ref>Sundaram, R.V.S:1983</ref> [[Krishna Kumari]]'s classification is more comprehensive even among other works on Telugu folk literature. But few genres were missing even in this classification. She did not consider caste myth as a separate [[genre]]. It occupies a [[lion's share|lion share]] in Telugu folk literature in terms of size and a prominent place in terms of its social importance and function. And some more sub divisions can also be found in a close look at the [[grassroots|grassroot]] level of Telugu Folk Literature.\n\nThe Telugu folk literature can be classified on different aspects. The first aspect is on genre basis, second is on the persons and [[patronage]], the third one is its [[utility]]. It would be convenient to elaborate in reverse direction and first I would take utility aspect.\nFunctional and entertainment genres:\n\nThe entire Telugu folk literature can be classified on the basis of its utility that is how it is functioning. It can be divided into functional and nonfunctional or entertainment genres. Some of the literary forms are both at a time. Caste myths and Ritual narratives have specific social functions, they are not for entertainment. They are basically intended to carry a specific social function.\n\n===Caste [[Myth|myths]]===\nA caste myth is basically a myth by its [[:wikt::sacrality]], and it is unique by its structure and function. A caste myth is called a [[Kula Purana]] or Caste Purana. Names of these myths are formed along the name of the caste, like Gouda purana for the caste of Goudas, Rjaka puranams for Rajakas or Chakalivaru Washer men and so on. A caste myth is a myth or a narrative of a caste which explains the origin and establishment of a caste. It tries to establish a given caste as a higher most one in the social order and it is not inferior to any other caste. Each caste of 196 castes in Andhra Pradesh having its own Caste myth. Caste myths are very important folk literary forms in terms of their social function. They are very much alive and vigorous in functions, even in the modern democratic social order. Several evidences prove the existence of the caste myths in oral tradition and written tradition even from the [[11th century]]. Each caste has its own myth and the time for its narration may vary from three hours to 14 nights, i.e. at least 100 hours. Most castes of [[Andhra Pradesh]] have their own performing dependent castes to narrate or perform their caste myths once in a year in each patron family. They are called Arthi kulalu or Asrita kulalu. There  are more than 50 dependent performing castes still existing and functioning in A.P. A caste myth is an [[creation myth|origin narrative]] of a given caste and it is the pride of the each member of any caste. It is a sacred narrative, whose validity cannot be questioned, and it is a [[Mahabharata]] for that particular caste. Caste myths are available in song, performing and prose narrative forms in oral tradition. Though it is a myth by genre, caste myth has a different kind of structure than the general myth, so that the caste myth is itself an independent folk genre. (See: Kulapuranalu Asrita Vyavastha, Subbachary, p.&nbsp;2000: for the detailed study of the caste myths and the dependent caste system.)\n\n===Ritual narratives===\nA ritual narrative is narrative sung or performed in a ritual, as an inseparable part of that ritual. It loses its importance when it is dissociated from that ritual. It is another functional narrative. These narratives are nothing but the narratives of Goddesses and Gods. The narratives of mother goddesses of A.P enjoy a prominent social relevance in the society. These narratives are sung or performed in the Jataras or Tirunallas of the Mother goddess and the Perantalu or the deified women goddesses. The mother goddesses like, [[Ankalamma|Ankamma]], Maremma, Poleramma, Peddamma, Atalamma, Ellamma, Pochamma and so on are considered to be the goddesses of diseases. They are the destructive or malevolent goddesses. They are also protective or guardian deities but their prominence is for their destructive power. They have to be appeased time to time or annually, otherwise they would show their wrath by creating [[Epidemic|epidemics]]. The best ways of appeasing these goddess are to sing the narrative of the relevant goddess in her praise and offer hrt animal [[Sacrifice|sacrifices]]. Performing the narrative or the [[puranas|puranam]] or the myth of the goddess is very crucial in the week day ritual of any mother goddess. These myths are very long and performed from one night to seven nights. The audience listens to them not only with reverence but also with fear and obedience. They also get into trance while the narratives are being performed. Specific caste people from dalit communities Baindlas, Asadis are specialized and traditional singers for all these mother goddesses. The Kurumas are singers for the myths of the male gods Mallanna, Birappa and the Goddess Ellamma. The literature of these myths or the narratives is also very big repertoire in Telugu folk literature. No year goes without the performance of mother goddess narratives in several hundred places in A.P. A number of scholars Krishna Kumari.N, Venkata Subbarao.T.V, Premalata Ravi. Andamma.M and others did commendable research on mother goddess worship and narratives.\n\n===Proverbs===\nAnother important and powerful functional genre is the Telugu sameta or the [[Telugu folk literature|Telugu proverb]]. Any other folk literary genre may not be a part of everyday life of the speaker of a given language. But proverbs are part of day-to-day life. For the native speakers the proverb is an essential tool for their communicative needs and it is a folk literary genre.\n\nTelugu folk literature has a stunningly rich treasure trove of proverbs. People use them in any mode of their expression. Number of researchers have already collected thousands of proverbs and published them region wide. One scholar, [[Chilukuri Narayana Rao]], has collected to one hundred thousand proverbs to his credit. Lot of research was also done on various aspects of Telugu proverbs. Several Colonial officials too collected Telugu proverbs. Captain Carr's collection is prominent among them. He collected around three thousand proverbs and translated them into English.<ref>Carr M.W 1868, 1989</ref> One can find parallels in Telugu to the proverbs which are omnipresent in different languages across the world.\n\nThese are some of the basic Telugu folk literary forms which are in [[social function]]. The other folk literary forms or basically intended for entertainment their social function is secondary.\n\n==Persons and professional singers and patronage==\nThe second kind of classification can be made on the basis of persons and patronage. Telugu folk literature can be divided in two major classes: folk literature created by professional singers and/or performers and the literature created by others. The folk literary genres created by the professional performers are different from the other genres in terms of length, prose and poetry combination, narration, and in other aspects. A number of castes of Andhra Pradesh are specialized to perform different kinds folk art forms in which literature is a vital part. Singing and performing is their basic profession  and they get lively hood by this profession. Again the professional singers or the bards or ministerial can be divided into two kinds some performing castes perform their art form to any caste or family of any village. For example, [[snake charming|snake charmers]] or Pamula vallu, [[Haridasus]], Satanis, Jangamas, Saradakadus and such other performers when they enter into a village they do not restrict their singing to only some castes or families. Other kind of singers do not extend their services to any body except their own patrons. They are dependents to only one caste. They narrate myths, caste myths, or other narratives only to their patrons. Narrating to others encroaching into other singer's jurisdiction is a crime according to their caste laws.\n\nMost of the important Telugu folk narratives, myths, legends are created by the professional singers and performers of the performing caste, all the caste myths are created by the dependent caste singers or the Asritakulalavaru. Other important epics like Mahabharata, Ramayana, Palanati Virakatha, Bobbilikatha, Katamaraju Kathalu, the myths of mother goddesses, and other important lengthy wonder tales which are very popular among Telugus are created by professional singers or the caste performers.\n\nThe folk literature created by men, women, and children consists of folk songs, song narratives, lullabies, work songs, women songs, different other kind of songs, general tales, wonder tales proverbs, riddles and so on. Telugu folk literature is very rich for all these genres. Collection and researching of these folk genres has been started in the colonial period itself. After the advent of universities in A.P several scholars did research on all kinds of these genres.\n\n==The arena of folk literary genres==\nOne classification of folk literature is genre based. Krishnakumari made a comprehensive classification of Telugu folk literature. It can be followed here to enumerate the Telugu folk literature and some more items can also be added to this classification.\n\nThe Telugu folk literature has three basic divisions.\n\n===[[Prose]] or Vachana Sakha===\nThe Prose division has two important sections they are Katha Sahitham or Prose with story and Katha Rahitham or prose without story. The section prose with story contains Nitikathalu (moral tales) Vira Kathalu, (epics) Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales), Purakathalu (myths), Itihasalu (legends) Pedarasi Peddamma Kathalu (fables). Some more categories can also be identified like Kula Kathalu (caste myths in prose), Perantalla Kathalu (stories of deified women), Tirpu Kathalu (stories of judgments), and so on. The non-story prose genres are proverbs and riddles or Sametalu and Podupukathalu.\n\n===[[Poetry]] or Geya Sakha===\nThe poetry division again has Story and non story sections. In story section Sramika Geyamulu (work songs), Strila patalu (women songs) Asrita kulala vari Patalu (songs by different caste performers) are there. In work songs male female division is there. The songs by women while they are working in fields are very important. Several stories are revealed and they give vent to their feelings through these stories. The songs at home are different from these songs not only in rhythm but also in length and mode of narration. The women songs can be classified  into vrata  kathalu or the stories of women rituals and pouranika stories or the mythological stores. Songs of the professional singers or the dependent castes can be categorized into Vira Kathalu (heroic songs or ballads), Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales or fairy tales), Purakathalu (general myths and myths of mother goddesses), Charitraka Kathalu (historical songs) Strila kathalu (women related stories). The non story section in the Poetry division contain three important categories they are Sharmika Geyamulu or work songs, Paramarthika Geyamulu or mystic songs and Koutumbika Geyamulu or family songs. The work songs contain stringara (erotic), hasya (humor) and karuna (pathetic) kinds of songs and the family songs contain bandhutwa (songs of relation), and achara (ceremonious songs).\n\n===[[Drama]] or Drisya Sakha===\nThe third division Drisya Sakha or the folk drama or folk theatre. The division is basically belongs to the art forms, as literature is vital in the folk theatre therefore the division should invariably be included in the classification of Telugu folk literature. Telugu folklore is very rich for folk theatre. Most of the art forms of (more than fifty) the dependant castes are theatre forms. The art forms like Oggu katha, Bindla Katha, Kommula Katha, Sarada Katha, Burra katha, Runja Katha, Chindu [[Yakshagana|Yakshaganam]], chirutala Yakshaganam, Patam katha, Pandava Katha, and several folk art forms are very popular theatre forms in which the spoken word is vital, are very rich for literature. Vidhi natakam, Yakshaganam, Turpu Bhagotam, and some other folk art forms are there which are for all castes in any village. The theatre division can be classified into two sections one is theatre by the artists the other is puppet theatre. Literature is an essential ingredient even in the puppet theatre. The Ramayana story is basic theme for the shadow puppet theatre of Andhra Pradesh. Patam Katha or the scroll narrative contains the Mahabharata as its theme, entire Mahabharata is narrated in different episodes in the art form of Pandavalu and Kakipadagalu artists. Some other mythical caste mythical themes are also there is form of scroll narratives. Still there are more than 72 folk theatre art forms are living in the region.\n\nThe above classification is the general and primary genre based classification of Telugu folk literature. Innumerable number of examples for each category can be given. Each above category in all major divisions and different sections is very rich. It would be impractical in this paper to showcase them. But introducing some of the songs and narratives here would serve the purpose.\n\n==Songs of the soil==\nSome Telugu folk narratives are very popular in Andhra Pradesh. They are associated with the history and folk life of the region. Even the Mahabharata and Ramayana stories and a plethora of historical and semihistorical narratives in various folk art forms acclaimed wide popularity and educated the rural non literate people. They know the gods and goddesses kings and queens primarily from the folk narratives and visual media like Vidhi natakam (street play) Tolubommalata (shadow puppet theatre) Patam katha (scroll narrative) and so on. The cinema of early times did not try to go much away from the folk art forms. Cinema has not only got interested in folk art forms but also incorporated them in many ways. Folk literature, music, and art forms have their proper places in the cinema. Folk songs and their tunes are big money-making assets even in present day Telugu cinema.\n\n===Palnati Vira Charitra===\nIt is also called Palaanati Bharatam. The story of the epic resembles with the story of Mahabharata, this story also contains a ferocious battle between brothers and close relatives. It is a heroic [[epic]] of Telugus. The epic is the story of the Haihaya dynasty and belongs to the [[12th century]]. The battle is not just for the throne or the territory it is a battle between two religious philosophies, the Vaishanavism and [[Shaivism]]. The Brahmanaidu and the Nagamma take two sides. The Brahmanaidu advocates the equality of the castes and encourages the untouchable community to enter into the temples and allow them to dine with other village caste people. The effort was popularly called Chapakudu. The other religious sect under the leadership of Nagamma opposed the \u2018anarchy\u2019 but battled in the guise of cock fight, sending the kings to forests and finally to the battle field. Finally the blood of Telugu heroes and towering philosophy of  Brahmanaidu stand victorious, and remained for ever in the land. The characters Brahmanaidu, Balachandrudu, Nagamma, Manchala are very popular in the entire region. The heroes are worshipped in an annual ritual in the folk art form of Pichukunti Katha which is performed by Pichukuntis or the palnati vira vidyavantulu a performing caste of Andhra Pradesh. The singers perform the epic with swords and shields in their hands and use them as props for their performance. The principal narrator takes a  sword in the right hand and a shield in the left. A bunch of jingling bells are tied to the sword. The artist uses the sword as a musical instrument and it becomes a valuable prop in the narration of story. The singer becomes a battle hero. The tunes of the songs also appear in a different way. Most of the time they crate a mood of sorrow and valor. The Palnati epic is not only a pride symbol of Telugus it is one of the great folk heroic sagas of the nation. Different [[Scholar|scholars]] like Akkairaju Umakantam from the region collected the narrative and published. Gene H. Roghair collected the epic from the Pichukunti performers and published it along with English translation and a scholarly editorial. The epic is very popular not only in Pichukunti katha but also other folk art forms like Burra katha, Sarada katha.\n\n===Katamaraju Kathalu===\nIt is a very long folk ballad. It is a very popular heroic song of the land. It is a [[Epic of Katamaraju|big epic]] of a battle between the kings of Katamaraju, and Manumasiddhi of the [[Nellore Chodas]]. The battle occurred in the [[13th century]], it is the dispute of territory and the misunderstanding of two kings. The valor of Khadga Tikkana and the Telugu kings has been portrayed in this heroic song and the epic is being carried through folk literature and the art form Kommula Katha or Pumba Katha, performed by the caste Kommulas. Telugu culture and the pastoral life are widely described in the long epic. It is not only rich for the description of culture of the land but also for the poetry and expressions of the singers. The epic singers Kommulas and Pumbalas perform it in such a way that the audience immerses in the themes and they identify themselves in all the rasas or the emotions of the narrative. The folk epic is a pride symbol of Telugus. This [[ballad]] [[song cycle|cycle]] has been collected and published in two big volumes of around three thousand pages, enriched by scholarly editorial by Tangirala Venkata Subbarao.\n\n===Bobbili Katha===\n{{See also|Bobbili Yuddham|Vijayaramaraju }}\nIt is another heroic folk epic of Telugu it is not just an epic it is a recent history of Telugu land. [[Bobbili]] is a small principalityof Northern Andhra. The French commander, [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]], attacked the fort of Bobbili in 1757. This is happened because of the rivalry between the two kingdoms of Bobbili and [[Vijayanagaram]]. Ultimately the treachery of kind Vijayaramaraju resulted in the war. The Bobbili heroes fought against the guns and cannons of French soldiers with their swords and arrows until they fall on the battlefield. The French soldiers were astonished by the utmost courage shown by the kings of Bobbili and other soldiers and even by the women soldiers.{{cn}} The heroes [[Tandra Paparayudu | Paparayudu]], Rangarayudu, and Vengalarayudu became househo;d words in Andhra. The people sing the valor of their heroes with pride. The saga of heroes remained in different folk literary genres i.e. song, drama Burrakatha, Sarada Katha apart from the classical literary forms.\n\n===Other important narratives===\nApart from the above very popular folk literary themes some other themes are also very popular in the land even in the modern times. All the caste myths regularly performed by the caste singers are very popular and considered sacred and authentic by their respective castes. More than 150 caste myths are alive and vibrant among the castes. Most of the myths of mother goddesses and the Perantal goddesses are also popular and heard with high respect, Ankamma katha, Maremma katha Ellamma katha, Mandhata katha, Tirupamma katha, Kamma katha, Sanysamma katha and such myths are still have currency in the folk life of Andhras. They are still being performed in the annual Jataras of the goddesses in most of the parts of Andhra.\n\nDifferent types of folk tales shown in the aforementioned classification exist in Telugu folk literature. Short fables, bedtime tales, long wonder tales and such other types of tales still exist in large numbers. Balanagamma katha, Kumara Ramuni katha, Desingu raju katha and kasimajuli kathalu, Tenali Ramalingani kathalu and other tale cycles are very popular and taking breath in the winds of the Telugu villages.\n\nTelugu folk song has a strong life it is very powerful across the ages. It is not only amusing the people by its sweet tunes but also shivering the misrules with its powerful words.{{what|date=April 2020}} Folk song when it is applied for the revolutionary is becoming a weapon. Folk song is not inferior to any literary genre, and it is very rich in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHundreds and thousands of [[Folk music|folk songs]] were collected right from 1850 to present day, several collections were published and number of scholars did research on different themes of folk songs and published these. Still lot of work has to be done and collection of the folk songs in district, mandal and village level has to be under taken. Song narratives particularly women's narratives on different themes are very important. Little attention has been paid to this genre. Song narratives of women are of two kinds: one is for at work and the other is for at home and in domestic rituals of vratas. Both are very important in terms of literature and gender issues.\n\nRiddle is another very important prose genre of Telugu folk literature. Riddles in Telugu are entertaining and educating not only for the children but also for the elders. They come down from generation to generation. Telugu riddle does not have any ritual importance like riddles among other ethnic groups of the land. Thousands of riddles were collected by several scholars and published. Dr. Kasireddy Venkatareddy has done a remarkable research on Telugu riddles.\n\nSome other unique kind of folk literary genres also can be find in Andhra Pradesh the performances by single individual artists like Pittala Dora, Hari Katha, Runja Katha are unique in their mode of presentation and narrative techniques. The narrative in the Pittala dora is very interesting. It does not contain any story or theme but it is a prose rendition goes on more than an hour in each performance. It attracts big crowds in the villages. The text creates high quality of humor by the gossip and themeless boosting speech by the artist. In similar fashion Runja Katha is known for its unique kind of narrating techniques. One artist takes the roles of all characters of the theme. Harikatha is also performed by a single singer but it is supported by two to other [[Musical instrument|musical instruments]]. Though it can be considered as a folk art form it is a semi classical in its nature, music and literature. Most of the themes in Harikatha are mythological.\n\n==Conclusion==\nThat is the bird's-eye view of the landscape of the Telugu folk literature today. Though it is centuries old it is not old. Yes, some of the rare art forms are gradually disappearing. But the overall situation is not alarming. Telugu folk literature, song and drama are not only very much alive, but also dynamic and vibrant. It is a valuable social asset of the land. It not only gives pleasure to the people it awakes them and carries out an important social function, keeping the social identity of its patrons. Still it is a very big [[treasure]] of material for researchers and social scientists as still there are many unexplored areas in this landscape.\n\n== Select bibliography ==\n*Arudra 1965 : Samgra Andhra Sahityam, (Vol.1) Secunderabad, M.

It is as difficult as to decide the origin of any language. In other words, one can argue that the origin and existence of any folk literature can be a parallel phenomenon along with that language. Because the folk expressive traditions of any ethnic group are much earlier than the language of that particular ethnic group. Need not say about the developed [[literature]] in written tradition. The [[Cave paintings in India|cave paintings]], line drawings found in different [[archeological sites]] prove the ability of the creative expressions of [[prehistoric]] human beings even before they were not able to speak. The addition of verbal creativity in latter periods has widened the folk expressive tradition in another medium that is verbal folk arts or the folk literature. Therefore, the existence of any folk literature can go back to the time of the given language correspondingly.\n\n==The origins of Telugu folk literature==\n[[Telugu language|Telugu]] is the most widely-spoken [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language on Earth and is spoken in all of [[Andhra Pradesh]]  in [[India]] and parts of other southern states as well. The history of Telugu goes back as early as to 230 BC to 225 AD,<ref>Krishnamoorty, B.H.1974:2</ref> and the evidence for the existence of [[Telugu language]] is available in the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' of the [[Bharatha people]]. Even better evidence is shown from the inscription of Nandampudi written by none other than the first Telugu poet Nannya goes back to the 11th century AD.<ref>Krishnamoorty, B.H.1974:4</ref> The author of ''Samagrandhra Sahityam'' (''The Comprehensive history of Telugu Literature'') [[Aarudhra]] has developed a different kind of argument. He says the word \"naagabu\" is there in an inscription of the [[Amaravati Stupa]] Buddha Sthupa, built between 200 BC to 200 AD <ref>Arudra 1965:6</ref> the [[suffix]] of this word 'bu' is a typical Telugu suffix and it can not be there unless the language was considerably developed in spoken form. (He considered the word a sacred '[[mantra]]' and printed it on the top place of the cover page of his book). More reliable evidence for the existence of Telugu language were shown by him at least from 350 AD. Based on this evidence it is possible to come to a rough idea that the verbal expressive traditions of Telugus may be there even at the beginning of the [[common era]].\n\nIndisputable concrete historical evidence of Telugu folk literature is available in the poetical work, the [[Kum\u0101rasambhava]] by Nannechoda who belongs to the 11th and 12th centuries. He has mentioned different kinds of songs sung by different folk groups (goudu geetamulu or songs of gouds).<ref>Mahadeva Sastri, Korada (ed). 1968: 128-130</ref> Some more inscriptional evidences for the existence of folk literature are also available in the [[6th century AD]].<ref>Ramaraju, B 1968:46-48</ref> According to [[Ramaraju]] some of the prosodic structures, found in this period, very closely resemble to the metrical order of folk songs of modern times. The evidence may not clearly show a particular song or its existence but one cannot rule out the possible existence of folk literature even before this period as the evidence for the existence of [[Telugu language]] was there from much earlier period.\n\nMany traditional Telugu poetical works of earlier and medieval age, taking form the Palkuriki Somanadha's Basava Purana to the Yakshagana (written works) of Nayaka kings of the [[17th century]], have mentioned about different performing castes and performing traditions, which were living and moving in the Andhra desa i.e., the present Andhra Pradesh.\n\n==Taxonomy of Telugu folk literary genres==\nThe Telugu folk literature is so enormously rich that it contains all major categories of world folk literature. The folk literary categories, which were classified in various languages by the scholars across the world, can be found in the Telugu folk literature. Some unique kind of folk literary forms like [[Caste system in India|caste]] myth also can be found in it. It is very rich not only in terms of variety of genres but the enormous size of the repertoires of various performing castes and individual singers. Many scholars have already classified Telugu folk literature in different divisions and sub divisions in an efficient way depending on the material they have considered for the study.<ref>Krishna Kumari, N.1977: 19</ref><ref>Ramaraju, B.1978b</ref><ref>Sundaram, R.V.S:1983</ref> [[Krishna Kumari]]'s classification is more comprehensive even among other works on Telugu folk literature. But few genres were missing even in this classification. She did not consider caste myth as a separate [[genre]]. It occupies a [[lion's share|lion share]] in Telugu folk literature in terms of size and a prominent place in terms of its social importance and function. And some more sub divisions can also be found in a close look at the [[grassroots|grassroot]] level of Telugu Folk Literature.\n\nThe Telugu folk literature can be classified on different aspects. The first aspect is on genre basis, second is on the persons and [[patronage]], the third one is its [[utility]]. It would be convenient to elaborate in reverse direction and first I would take utility aspect.\nFunctional and entertainment genres:\n\nThe entire Telugu folk literature can be classified on the basis of its utility that is how it is functioning. It can be divided into functional and nonfunctional or entertainment genres. Some of the literary forms are both at a time. Caste myths and Ritual narratives have specific social functions, they are not for entertainment. They are basically intended to carry a specific social function.\n\n===Caste [[Myth|myths]]===\nA caste myth is basically a myth by its [[:wikt::sacrality]], and it is unique by its structure and function. A caste myth is called a [[Kula Purana]] or Caste Purana. Names of these myths are formed along the name of the caste, like Gouda purana for the caste of Goudas, Rjaka puranams for Rajakas or Chakalivaru Washer men and so on. A caste myth is a myth or a narrative of a caste which explains the origin and establishment of a caste. It tries to establish a given caste as a higher most one in the social order and it is not inferior to any other caste. Each caste of 196 castes in Andhra Pradesh having its own Caste myth. Caste myths are very important folk literary forms in terms of their social function. They are very much alive and vigorous in functions, even in the modern democratic social order. Several evidences prove the existence of the caste myths in oral tradition and written tradition even from the [[11th century]]. Each caste has its own myth and the time for its narration may vary from three hours to 14 nights, i.e. at least 100 hours. Most castes of [[Andhra Pradesh]] have their own performing dependent castes to narrate or perform their caste myths once in a year in each patron family. They are called Arthi kulalu or Asrita kulalu. There  are more than 50 dependent performing castes still existing and functioning in A.P. A caste myth is an [[creation myth|origin narrative]] of a given caste and it is the pride of the each member of any caste. It is a sacred narrative, whose validity cannot be questioned, and it is a [[Mahabharata]] for that particular caste. Caste myths are available in song, performing and prose narrative forms in oral tradition. Though it is a myth by genre, caste myth has a different kind of structure than the general myth, so that the caste myth is itself an independent folk genre. (See: Kulapuranalu Asrita Vyavastha, Subbachary, p.&nbsp;2000: for the detailed study of the caste myths and the dependent caste system.)\n\n===Ritual narratives===\nA ritual narrative is narrative sung or performed in a ritual, as an inseparable part of that ritual. It loses its importance when it is dissociated from that ritual. It is another functional narrative. These narratives are nothing but the narratives of Goddesses and Gods. The narratives of mother goddesses of A.P enjoy a prominent social relevance in the society. These narratives are sung or performed in the Jataras or Tirunallas of the Mother goddess and the Perantalu or the deified women goddesses. The mother goddesses like, [[Ankalamma|Ankamma]], Maremma, Poleramma, Peddamma, Atalamma, Ellamma, Pochamma and so on are considered to be the goddesses of diseases. They are the destructive or malevolent goddesses. They are also protective or guardian deities but their prominence is for their destructive power. They have to be appeased time to time or annually, otherwise they would show their wrath by creating [[Epidemic|epidemics]]. The best ways of appeasing these goddess are to sing the narrative of the relevant goddess in her praise and offer hrt animal [[Sacrifice|sacrifices]]. Performing the narrative or the [[puranas|puranam]] or the myth of the goddess is very crucial in the week day ritual of any mother goddess. These myths are very long and performed from one night to seven nights. The audience listens to them not only with reverence but also with fear and obedience. They also get into trance while the narratives are being performed. Specific caste people from dalit communities Baindlas, Asadis are specialized and traditional singers for all these mother goddesses. The Kurumas are singers for the myths of the male gods Mallanna, Birappa and the Goddess Ellamma. The literature of these myths or the narratives is also very big repertoire in Telugu folk literature. No year goes without the performance of mother goddess narratives in several hundred places in A.P. A number of scholars Krishna Kumari.N, Venkata Subbarao.T.V, Premalata Ravi. Andamma.M and others did commendable research on mother goddess worship and narratives.\n\n===Proverbs===\nAnother important and powerful functional genre is the Telugu sameta or the [[Telugu folk literature|Telugu proverb]]. Any other folk literary genre may not be a part of everyday life of the speaker of a given language. But proverbs are part of day-to-day life. For the native speakers the proverb is an essential tool for their communicative needs and it is a folk literary genre.\n\nTelugu folk literature has a stunningly rich treasure trove of proverbs. People use them in any mode of their expression. Number of researchers have already collected thousands of proverbs and published them region wide. One scholar, [[Chilukuri Narayana Rao]], has collected to one hundred thousand proverbs to his credit. Lot of research was also done on various aspects of Telugu proverbs. Several Colonial officials too collected Telugu proverbs. Captain Carr's collection is prominent among them. He collected around three thousand proverbs and translated them into English.<ref>Carr M.W 1868, 1989</ref> One can find parallels in Telugu to the proverbs which are omnipresent in different languages across the world.\n\nThese are some of the basic Telugu folk literary forms which are in [[social function]]. The other folk literary forms or basically intended for entertainment their social function is secondary.\n\n==Persons and professional singers and patronage==\nThe second kind of classification can be made on the basis of persons and patronage. Telugu folk literature can be divided in two major classes: folk literature created by professional singers and/or performers and the literature created by others. The folk literary genres created by the professional performers are different from the other genres in terms of length, prose and poetry combination, narration, and in other aspects. A number of castes of Andhra Pradesh are specialized to perform different kinds folk art forms in which literature is a vital part. Singing and performing is their basic profession  and they get lively hood by this profession. Again the professional singers or the bards or ministerial can be divided into two kinds some performing castes perform their art form to any caste or family of any village. For example, [[snake charming|snake charmers]] or Pamula vallu, [[Haridasus]], Satanis, Jangamas, Saradakadus and such other performers when they enter into a village they do not restrict their singing to only some castes or families. Other kind of singers do not extend their services to any body except their own patrons. They are dependents to only one caste. They narrate myths, caste myths, or other narratives only to their patrons. Narrating to others encroaching into other singer's jurisdiction is a crime according to their caste laws.\n\nMost of the important Telugu folk narratives, myths, legends are created by the professional singers and performers of the performing caste, all the caste myths are created by the dependent caste singers or the Asritakulalavaru. Other important epics like Mahabharata, Ramayana, Palanati Virakatha, Bobbilikatha, Katamaraju Kathalu, the myths of mother goddesses, and other important lengthy wonder tales which are very popular among Telugus are created by professional singers or the caste performers.\n\nThe folk literature created by men, women, and children consists of folk songs, song narratives, lullabies, work songs, women songs, different other kind of songs, general tales, wonder tales proverbs, riddles and so on. Telugu folk literature is very rich for all these genres. Collection and researching of these folk genres has been started in the colonial period itself. After the advent of universities in A.P several scholars did research on all kinds of these genres.\n\n==The arena of folk literary genres==\nOne classification of folk literature is genre based. Krishnakumari made a comprehensive classification of Telugu folk literature. It can be followed here to enumerate the Telugu folk literature and some more items can also be added to this classification.\n\nThe Telugu folk literature has three basic divisions.\n\n===[[Prose]] or Vachana Sakha===\nThe Prose division has two important sections they are Katha Sahitham or Prose with story and Katha Rahitham or prose without story. The section prose with story contains Nitikathalu (moral tales) Vira Kathalu, (epics) Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales), Purakathalu (myths), Itihasalu (legends) Pedarasi Peddamma Kathalu (fables). Some more categories can also be identified like Kula Kathalu (caste myths in prose), Perantalla Kathalu (stories of deified women), Tirpu Kathalu (stories of judgments), and so on. The non-story prose genres are proverbs and riddles or Sametalu and Podupukathalu.\n\n===[[Poetry]] or Geya Sakha===\nThe poetry division again has Story and non story sections. In story section Sramika Geyamulu (work songs), Strila patalu (women songs) Asrita kulala vari Patalu (songs by different caste performers) are there. In work songs male female division is there. The songs by women while they are working in fields are very important. Several stories are revealed and they give vent to their feelings through these stories. The songs at home are different from these songs not only in rhythm but also in length and mode of narration. The women songs can be classified  into vrata  kathalu or the stories of women rituals and pouranika stories or the mythological stores. Songs of the professional singers or the dependent castes can be categorized into Vira Kathalu (heroic songs or ballads), Adbhuta Kathalu (wonder tales or fairy tales), Purakathalu (general myths and myths of mother goddesses), Charitraka Kathalu (historical songs) Strila kathalu (women related stories). The non story section in the Poetry division contain three important categories they are Sharmika Geyamulu or work songs, Paramarthika Geyamulu or mystic songs and Koutumbika Geyamulu or family songs. The work songs contain stringara (erotic), hasya (humor) and karuna (pathetic) kinds of songs and the family songs contain bandhutwa (songs of relation), and achara (ceremonious songs).\n\n===[[Drama]] or Drisya Sakha===\nThe third division Drisya Sakha or the folk drama or folk theatre. The division is basically belongs to the art forms, as literature is vital in the folk theatre therefore the division should invariably be included in the classification of Telugu folk literature. Telugu folklore is very rich for folk theatre. Most of the art forms of (more than fifty) the dependant castes are theatre forms. The art forms like Oggu katha, Bindla Katha, Kommula Katha, Sarada Katha, Burra katha, Runja Katha, Chindu [[Yakshagana|Yakshaganam]], chirutala Yakshaganam, Patam katha, Pandava Katha, and several folk art forms are very popular theatre forms in which the spoken word is vital, are very rich for literature. Vidhi natakam, Yakshaganam, Turpu Bhagotam, and some other folk art forms are there which are for all castes in any village. The theatre division can be classified into two sections one is theatre by the artists the other is puppet theatre. Literature is an essential ingredient even in the puppet theatre. The Ramayana story is basic theme for the shadow puppet theatre of Andhra Pradesh. Patam Katha or the scroll narrative contains the Mahabharata as its theme, entire Mahabharata is narrated in different episodes in the art form of Pandavalu and Kakipadagalu artists. Some other mythical caste mythical themes are also there is form of scroll narratives. Still there are more than 72 folk theatre art forms are living in the region.\n\nThe above classification is the general and primary genre based classification of Telugu folk literature. Innumerable number of examples for each category can be given. Each above category in all major divisions and different sections is very rich. It would be impractical in this paper to showcase them. But introducing some of the songs and narratives here would serve the purpose.\n\n==Songs of the soil==\nSome Telugu folk narratives are very popular in Andhra Pradesh. They are associated with the history and folk life of the region. Even the Mahabharata and Ramayana stories and a plethora of historical and semihistorical narratives in various folk art forms acclaimed wide popularity and educated the rural non literate people. They know the gods and goddesses kings and queens primarily from the folk narratives and visual media like Vidhi natakam (street play) Tolubommalata (shadow puppet theatre) Patam katha (scroll narrative) and so on. The cinema of early times did not try to go much away from the folk art forms. Cinema has not only got interested in folk art forms but also incorporated them in many ways. Folk literature, music, and art forms have their proper places in the cinema. Folk songs and their tunes are big money-making assets even in present day Telugu cinema.\n\n===Palnati Vira Charitra===\nIt is also called Palaanati Bharatam. The story of the epic resembles with the story of Mahabharata, this story also contains a ferocious battle between brothers and close relatives. It is a heroic [[epic]] of Telugus. The epic is the story of the Haihaya dynasty and belongs to the [[12th century]]. The battle is not just for the throne or the territory it is a battle between two religious philosophies, the Vaishanavism and [[Shaivism]]. The Brahmanaidu and the Nagamma take two sides. The Brahmanaidu advocates the equality of the castes and encourages the untouchable community to enter into the temples and allow them to dine with other village caste people. The effort was popularly called Chapakudu. The other religious sect under the leadership of Nagamma opposed the \u2018anarchy\u2019 but battled in the guise of cock fight, sending the kings to forests and finally to the battle field. Finally the blood of Telugu heroes and towering philosophy of  Brahmanaidu stand victorious, and remained for ever in the land. The characters Brahmanaidu, Balachandrudu, Nagamma, Manchala are very popular in the entire region. The heroes are worshipped in an annual ritual in the folk art form of Pichukunti Katha which is performed by Pichukuntis or the palnati vira vidyavantulu a performing caste of Andhra Pradesh. The singers perform the epic with swords and shields in their hands and use them as props for their performance. The principal narrator takes a  sword in the right hand and a shield in the left. A bunch of jingling bells are tied to the sword. The artist uses the sword as a musical instrument and it becomes a valuable prop in the narration of story. The singer becomes a battle hero. The tunes of the songs also appear in a different way. Most of the time they crate a mood of sorrow and valor. The Palnati epic is not only a pride symbol of Telugus it is one of the great folk heroic sagas of the nation. Different [[Scholar|scholars]] like Akkairaju Umakantam from the region collected the narrative and published. Gene H. Roghair collected the epic from the Pichukunti performers and published it along with English translation and a scholarly editorial. The epic is very popular not only in Pichukunti katha but also other folk art forms like Burra katha, Sarada katha.\n\n===Katamaraju Kathalu===\nIt is a very long folk ballad. It is a very popular heroic song of the land. It is a [[Epic of Katamaraju|big epic]] of a battle between the kings of Katamaraju, and Manumasiddhi of the [[Nellore Chodas]]. The battle occurred in the [[13th century]], it is the dispute of territory and the misunderstanding of two kings. The valor of Khadga Tikkana and the Telugu kings has been portrayed in this heroic song and the epic is being carried through folk literature and the art form Kommula Katha or Pumba Katha, performed by the caste Kommulas. Telugu culture and the pastoral life are widely described in the long epic. It is not only rich for the description of culture of the land but also for the poetry and expressions of the singers. The epic singers Kommulas and Pumbalas perform it in such a way that the audience immerses in the themes and they identify themselves in all the rasas or the emotions of the narrative. The folk epic is a pride symbol of Telugus. This [[ballad]] [[song cycle|cycle]] has been collected and published in two big volumes of around three thousand pages, enriched by scholarly editorial by Tangirala Venkata Subbarao.\n\n===Bobbili Katha===\n{{See also|Bobbili Yuddham|Vijayaramaraju }}\nIt is another heroic folk epic of Telugu it is not just an epic it is a recent history of Telugu land. [[Bobbili]] is a small principalityof Northern Andhra. The French commander, [[Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau]], attacked the fort of Bobbili in 1757. This is happened because of the rivalry between the two kingdoms of Bobbili and [[Vijayanagaram]]. Ultimately the treachery of kind Vijayaramaraju resulted in the war. The Bobbili heroes fought against the guns and cannons of French soldiers with their swords and arrows until they fall on the battlefield. The French soldiers were astonished by the utmost courage shown by the kings of Bobbili and other soldiers and even by the women soldiers.{{cn}} The heroes [[Tandra Paparayudu | Paparayudu]], Rangarayudu, and Vengalarayudu became househo;d words in Andhra. The people sing the valor of their heroes with pride. The saga of heroes remained in different folk literary genres i.e. song, drama Burrakatha, Sarada Katha apart from the classical literary forms.\n\n===Other important narratives===\nApart from the above very popular folk literary themes some other themes are also very popular in the land even in the modern times. All the caste myths regularly performed by the caste singers are very popular and considered sacred and authentic by their respective castes. More than 150 caste myths are alive and vibrant among the castes. Most of the myths of mother goddesses and the Perantal goddesses are also popular and heard with high respect, Ankamma katha, Maremma katha Ellamma katha, Mandhata katha, Tirupamma katha, Kamma katha, Sanysamma katha and such myths are still have currency in the folk life of Andhras. They are still being performed in the annual Jataras of the goddesses in most of the parts of Andhra.\n\nDifferent types of folk tales shown in the aforementioned classification exist in Telugu folk literature. Short fables, bedtime tales, long wonder tales and such other types of tales still exist in large numbers. Balanagamma katha, Kumara Ramuni katha, Desingu raju katha and kasimajuli kathalu, Tenali Ramalingani kathalu and other tale cycles are very popular and taking breath in the winds of the Telugu villages.\n\nTelugu folk song has a strong life it is very powerful across the ages. It is not only amusing the people by its sweet tunes but also shivering the misrules with its powerful words.{{what|date=April 2020}} Folk song when it is applied for the revolutionary is becoming a weapon. Folk song is not inferior to any literary genre, and it is very rich in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHundreds and thousands of [[Folk music|folk songs]] were collected right from 1850 to present day, several collections were published and number of scholars did research on different themes of folk songs and published these. Still lot of work has to be done and collection of the folk songs in district, mandal and village level has to be under taken. Song narratives particularly women's narratives on different themes are very important. Little attention has been paid to this genre. Song narratives of women are of two kinds: one is for at work and the other is for at home and in domestic rituals of vratas. Both are very important in terms of literature and gender issues.\n\nRiddle is another very important prose genre of Telugu folk literature. Riddles in Telugu are entertaining and educating not only for the children but also for the elders. They come down from generation to generation. Telugu riddle does not have any ritual importance like riddles among other ethnic groups of the land. Thousands of riddles were collected by several scholars and published. Dr. Kasireddy Venkatareddy has done a remarkable research on Telugu riddles.\n\nSome other unique kind of folk literary genres also can be find in Andhra Pradesh the performances by single individual artists like Pittala dora, Hari Katha, Runja Katha are unique in their mode of presentation and narrative techniques. The narrative in the Pittala dora is very interesting. It does not contain any story or theme but it is a prose rendition goes on more than an hour in each performance. It attracts big crowds in the villages. The text creates high quality of humor by the gossip and themeless boosting speech by the artist. In similar fashion Runja Katha is known for its unique kind of narrating techniques. One artist takes the roles of all characters of the theme. Harikatha is also performed by a single singer but it is supported by two to other [[Musical instrument|musical instruments]]. Though it can be considered as a folk art form it is a semi classical in its nature, music and literature. Most of the themes in Harikatha are mythological.\n\n==Conclusion==\nThat is the bird's-eye view of the landscape of the Telugu folk literature today. Though it is centuries old it is not old. Yes, some of the rare art forms are gradually disappearing. But the overall situation is not alarming. Telugu folk literature, song and drama are not only very much alive, but also dynamic and vibrant. It is a valuable social asset of the land. It not only gives pleasure to the people it awakes them and carries out an important social function, keeping the social identity of its patrons. Still it is a very big [[treasure]] of material for researchers and social scientists as still there are many unexplored areas in this landscape.\n\n== Select bibliography ==\n*Arudra 1965 : Samgra Andhra Sahityam, (Vol.1) Secunderabad, M.

The Task Force worked closely with the Nepalese Ambassadors in Canada and the United States of America as the Government of Nepal's representatives for coordination in the initial work. Later, the NRNA signed an agreement with the Nepal's Ministry of Education that provided official mandate of working on the OUN agenda to NRNA. Nepali Diaspora academics around the world rallied behind the OUN initiative, which turned into an important Diaspora project. Later, a series of Memoranda of Understandings were signed between the Government of Nepal and NRNA (2013, 2014 and 2015) and many workshops, webinars and symposia were held in different parts of the world including Canada, US, Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, and Nepal between 2010 and 2016. The places of these meetings, workshops and symposia included Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Houston, Sydney, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Kathmandu. Athabasca University (AU), Canada's Open University, located near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, provided technical support, and academic impetus throughout the process of formulating the plan and in the implementation of the program for the OUN.
