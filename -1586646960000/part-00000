There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley County Borough|Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established as an administrative and defensive unit in 918,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], London and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

And only an annoying loss with a minimum score in the semi-final [[Shirvani Muradov]]a (Russia), who became the winner of the tournament, did not give Khetagh to become an Olympic champion. \n\nThe Olympic carpet of London can not be called successful for Khetag. Having started the tournament well, he then lost to Ukrainian Valeri Andrejtsev, in view of the sharply deteriorating state of health. He was already taken to the hospital when he found out that he had the opportunity to qualify for a bronze medal. Khetag urged the doctors to turn around and take him back. He was given a dropper, and in this condition he went out to fight with a representative of Tajikistan.

Thomas, Earl of Ailesbury: ''Memoirs'' (1890) volume II, p.499</ref> or a bribe.<ref>\"...sugar-plum makers are as numerous in the Parisian Lombard-street, as are the traffickers in ''douceurs'' of a more substantial character in its namesake in London.\" \"New Year's Day In Paris,\" The Times [London, England] 1 January 1823, p.3.</ref> However, by the 1860s manufacturers were using steam heat and mechanized rotating pans, and it was then available for mass consumption.<ref name=Kawash/>\n\nToday, some candy manufacturers have taken \"sugar plum\" literally, creating plum-flavored, plum-shaped candies and marketing them as \"sugar plum candy\".\n\nAnother 21st-century take on the \"sugar plum\" instructs home cooks to combine dried fruits and [[almond]]s with [[honey]] and aromatic seeds ([[anise]], [[fennel]], [[caraway]], [[cardamom]]), form this mixture into balls, then coat in sugar or shredded coconut.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Brown\n  | first = Alton\n  | title = Sugarplums Recipe\n  | publisher = [[Good Eats]]\n  | year = 2009\n  | url = http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/sugarplums-recipe/index.html}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nSugar plums are widely associated with [[Christmas]], through cultural phenomena such as the Sugar Plum Fairy in ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' (composed by [[Tchaikovsky]], 1892), as well as the line \"While visions of sugar plums danced in their heads,\" from Clement C. Moore's poem ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]'' (1823), better known as \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\".\n\nIn the children's board game [[Candy Land]] the character Plumpy, a gingerbread troll, wore a sugar plum around his neck. Receiving the Plumpy card meant the player had to undo most of their progress, which could lead to great frustration and often prolonged the game. The Plumpy character was replaced in 2002 by Mama Gingertree.\n\nSugar plums have also gained widespread recognition through the poem ''\"The Sugar Plum Tree\"'' by [[Eugene Field]]. The poem begins \"Have you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree? 'Tis a marvel of great renown!\"<ref>The Sugar Plum Tree, by [[Eugene Field]] (from [http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/poems/field.asp FirstScience] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822143549/http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/poems/field.asp |date=2006-08-22 }}).</ref> \"[[Sugar Plum (jazz song)|Sugar Plum]]\" is also a 1971 jazz song by American jazz pianist [[Bill Evans]], while [[Sugar Plum Fairies]] is a Norwegian folk and pop band formed in 2000.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Christmas food]]\n[[Category:Confectionery]]\n", "name_user": "Arms & Hearts", "label": "safe", "comment": "fmt ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_plum"}
{"title_page": "Intake ramp", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2015}}\nAn '''intake ramp''' is a rectangular, plate-like device within the [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air intake]] of a [[jet engine]], designed to generate a number of [[shock wave]]s to aid the inlet compression process at [[supersonic]] speeds. The ramp sits at an acute angle to deflect the intake air from the longitudinal direction. At [[supersonic]] flight speeds, the deflection of the air stream creates a number of oblique shock waves at each change of gradient along at the ramp. Air crossing each shock wave suddenly slows to a lower [[Mach number]], thus increasing [[pressure]].\n\nIdeally, the first oblique shock wave should intercept the air intake lip, thus avoiding air spillage and pre-entry drag on the outer boundary of the deflected streamtube. For a fixed geometry intake at zero incidence, this condition can only be achieved at one particular flight Mach number, because the angle of the shock wave (to the longitudinal direction) becomes more acute with increasing aircraft speed.\n\nMore advanced supersonic intakes feature a ramp with a number of discrete changes of gradient in order to generate multiple oblique shock waves. In the case of [[Concorde]], the first (converging) intake ramp is followed by a diverging ramp. After the air passes the end of the first ramp it has become subsonic such that the diverging ramp further contributes towards the reduction in airstream velocity and consequently its increase in pressure. This intake design thus ensures excellent pressure recovery and contributes to Concorde's improved fuel efficiency whilst [[Supercruise|cruising supersonically]] at up to Mach 2.2 (beyond which airframe heating effects limit any further increase in speed).\n\nFor a fixed geometry it is feasible to use curved intakes without any shocks before the final normal shock.\nModern fighter jets (like the [[F-22 Raptor]]) have engines so powerful that top speed is not limited by them,\nthus spillage at the intake is acceptable and a lightweight fixed geometry chosen. The nacelle has a round outer lip to deflect spillage back into the longitudinal direction. The nacelle thus gets a very large cross section with more volume than needed for the engine and in the F-22 the nacelles are combined with the fuselage to create a large weapon bay, place for fuel, and a wide body, which generates some lift.\nModern jets have a horizontal ramp thus spillage at least produces some lift.\nIn the case of the F-22 the inlet has two ramps placed in a diamond shape, thus for most Mach- and thrust-conditions spillage occurs only at the aft / lower corner of that diamond.{{Or|date=June 2010}}\nIn the case of the F-22 the leading edges of the wing become supersonic at Mach 1.8 and certainly are as large a source of wave drag as the inlet.\n\nVariable geometry intakes, such as those on Concorde, vary the ramp angle to focus the series of oblique shock waves onto the intake lip, control of which is accomplished by complex non-linear control laws using the ramp void pressure (the pressure of the air in the gap between the two ramps) as a control input.\n\n==Intake gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Concordeintake.gif| Concorde ramps move to suit flight condition\nImage:Concorde Ramp.jpg| The ramps in two of the Concorde intakes are visible and clearly labelled as such.\nImage:F-14_3_Yokota_Tokyo.jpg| [[F-14]] with internal ramps forming upper surface of intake duct\nImage:North American XB-70 above runway ECN-792.jpg|Vertical ramps on inboard surface of intake duct [[XB-70]]\nImage:F-15E Strike Eagle is parked by a crew chief from Elmendorf Air Force Base.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] internal ramps form upper surface of intake duct behind the intake upper lips which are shown in different positions\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inlet cone]]\n*[[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|Splitter plate]]\n{{Aircraft components}}\n\n[[Category:Aircraft propulsion components]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2015}}\nAn '''intake ramp''' is a rectangular, plate-like device within the [[Components of jet engines#Air intakes|air intake]] of a [[jet engine]], designed to generate a number of [[shock wave]]s to aid the inlet compression process at [[supersonic]] speeds.
