It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title=Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California \u2013 San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191022/http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|archivedate=29 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the development of processing grain.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].\n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root. In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power. He emphasized that chronologically the [[Industrial Revolution]] follows the modern Agricultural Revolution and spatially the world's industrial regions are bound to cereal regions. Taken from space, map of the global illumination is said to indicate by its brightest parts the industrial regions.<ref>https://www.shutterstock.com/nl/video/clip-28056478-world-city-lights-map-animation-silhouettes-continents</ref> These regions coincide with cereal regions. Ostrovsky formulized the universal indicator of national power which unambiguously demonstrates the unipolar international hierarchy of the present world order:<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 119.</ref>\n\n: ''Total cereal tonnage produced by one percent of nation\u2019s manpower''\n\n==The Green Revolution==\n{{main|Green Revolution}}\nDuring the second half of the 20th century there was a significant increase in the production of high-yield cereal crops worldwide, especially wheat and rice, due to an initiative known as the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name=FAOGreenRevolution>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w2612e/w2612e06a.htm|title=Lessons from the green revolution: towards a new green revolution|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]]|accessdate=5 June 2017|quote=The green revolution was a technology package comprising material components of improved high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of two staple cereals (rice or \"wheat\"), irrigation or controlled \"water\" supply and improved moisture utilization, fertilizers and pesticides and associated management skills.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518074944/http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w2612e/w2612e06a.htm|archivedate=18 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The strategies developed by the Green Revolution focused on fending off starvation and increasing yield-per-plant, and were very successful in raising overall yields of cereal grains, but did not give sufficient relevance to nutritional quality.<ref name=SandsMorris2009>{{cite journal| vauthors=Sands DC, Morris CE, Dratz EA, Pilgeram A| title=Elevating optimal human nutrition to a central goal of plant breeding and production of plant-based foods. | journal=Plant Sci | year= 2009 | volume= 177 | issue= 5 | pages= 377\u201389 | pmid=20467463 | doi=10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.07.011 | pmc=2866137 | type=Review }}</ref> These modern high yield-cereal crops tend have low [[Protein quality|quality proteins]], with [[essential amino acid]] deficiencies, are high in [[carbohydrate]]s, and lack balanced [[essential fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[mineral]]s and other quality factors.<ref name=SandsMorris2009 /> So-called ancient grains and heirloom varieties have seen an increase in popularity with the \"organic\" movements of the early 21st century, but there is a tradeoff in yield-per-plant, putting pressure on resource-poor areas as food crops are replaced with cash crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/did-quinoa-get-too-popular-for-its-own-good.htm|title=Did Quinoa Get Too Popular for Its Own Good?|date=2018-11-05|website=HowStuffWorks|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Farming==\n[[File:040719 172 dorset marnhull.jpg|thumb|A wheat field in [[Dorset]], [[England]]]]\nWhile each individual species has its own peculiarities, the cultivation of all cereal crops is similar. Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

[[Emmer|Emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], and [[barley]] were three of the so-called [[Neolithic founder crops]] in the development of agriculture. Around the same time, millets and rices were starting to become domesticated in East Asia. Sorghum and millets were also being domesticated in sub-Saharan West Africa.\n\n==Cereals and civilization==\nCereals were the foundation of human civilization. Cereal frontiers coincided with civilizational frontiers. The term [[Fertile Crescent]] explicitely implies the spatial dependence of civilization on cereals. [[The Great Wall]] of China and the [[Roman limes|Roman limes]] demarkated the same northern limit of the cereal cultivation. The [[Silk Road]] stretched along the cereal belt of Eurasia. Numerous Chinese imperial edicts stated: \u201cAgriculture is the foundation of this empire,\u201d<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 86.</ref> while the foundation of agriculture were the [[Five Grains]].  \n\nCereals determined how large and for how long an army could be mobilized. For this reason, [[Shang Yang]] called agriculture and war \u201cthe One.\u201d<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 62.</ref> [[Guan Zhong]], [[Chanakya]] (the author of ''[[Arthashastra]]'')<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 63-64.</ref> and [[Hannibal]]<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 85.</ref> expressed similar concepts. At the dawn of history, the Sumerians believed that if agriculture of a state declines, [[Inanna]], the goddess of war, leaves this state.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 68.</ref> Several gods of antiquity combined the functions of what Shang Yang called \u201cthe One\u201d \u2013 agriculture and war: the Hittite [[Sun goddess of Arinna]], the Canaanite [[Lahmu]] and the Roman [[Janus]]. These were highly important gods in their time leaving their legacy until today. We still begin the year with the month of Janus (January). The Jews believe that Messiah will be born in the town of Lahmu ([[Bethlehem]]) and the Christians believe that he was already born there. Lahmu is the responsible why in Hebrew until today ''bread'' (''lehem'') and ''warfare'' (''lehima'') are of the same root.  In fact, most persistent and flourishing empires throughout history in both hemispheres were centered in regions fertile for cereals.\n\nHistorian Max Ostrovsky argues that this historic pattern never changed, not even in the [[Industrial Age]].<ref>Max Ostrovsky, ''The Hyperbola of the World Order'', Lanham: University Press of America, 2006, p 111-126.</ref> He stresses that all modern great powers have traditionally remained first and foremost great ''cereal'' powers. The \u201cfinest hour\u201d of the Axis powers \u201cended precisely the moment they threw themselves against the two largest cereal lebensraums\u201d (the United States and the USSR).<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 159.</ref> The outcome of the Cold War followed the Soviet grave and long-lasting cereal crisis, exacerbated by the cereal embargo imposed on the USSR in 1980.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 172.</ref> And, called \u201cthe grain basket of the world,\u201d the most productive \u201ccereal lebensraum\u201d dominates the world ever since.<ref>Ostrovsky 2006: p 206.</ref>\n\nHaving analyzed the mechanism at work behind this pattern, Ostrovsky outlined that the cereal power determines the percentage of manpower available to non-agricultural sectors including the heavy industry vital for military power. He emphasized that chronologically the [[Industrial Revolution]] follows the modern Agricultural Revolution and spatially the world\u2019s industrial regions are bound to cereal regions. Taken from space, map of the global illumination is said to indicate by its brightest parts the industrial regions.<ref>https://www.shutterstock.com/nl/video/clip-28056478-world-city-lights-map-animation-silhouettes-continents</ref> These regions coincide with cereal regions.

Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it ' \"may\" ' be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,{{efn|1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.}} 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210214103/http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=10 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013\n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205\n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

It is high in fiber and protein. Its flour is often used to make [[injera]]. It can also be eaten as a warm breakfast cereal similar to [[farina (food)|farina]] with a chocolate or nutty flavor. Its flour and whole grain products can usually be found in natural foods stores.\n* [[Wild rice]], grown in small amounts in North America.\n\nSeveral other species of wheat have also been domesticated, some very early in the history of agriculture:\n* [[Spelt]], a close relative of common wheat.\n* [[Einkorn]], a wheat species with a single grain.\n* [[Emmer]], one of the first crops domesticated in the [[Fertile Crescent]].\n* [[Durum]], the only [[tetraploid]] species of wheat currently cultivated, used to make [[semolina]].\n* [[Kamut]], an ancient relative of durum with an unknown history.\n\nIn 2013 global cereal production reached a record 2,521 million tonnes.

That is why many vegetarian cultures, in order to get a balanced diet, combine their diet of grains with [[legume]]s. Many legumes, however, are deficient in the essential amino acid [[methionine]], which grains contain. Thus, a [[protein combining|combination]] of legumes with [[grain]]s forms a well-balanced diet for vegetarians. Common examples of such combinations are [[dal]] (lentils) with [[rice]] by [[South India]]ns and [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], dal with wheat in [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]], [[beans]] with corn tortillas, [[tofu]] with rice, and [[peanut butter]] with wheat bread (as sandwiches) in several other cultures, including the Americas.<ref name=\"vogel301\">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/primemovernatura0000voge |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

At that point, there was a summit at Trigoria between Roma Sporting Director [[Walter Sabatini]] and the entire staff, including head coach [[Rudi Garcia]] and Simone Beccaccioli. Talks between the two clubs continued, where it was growing likely that the deal would officially be announced the following Monday.

At that point, there was a summit at Trigoria between Roma Sporting Director [[Walter Sabatini]] and the entire staff, including head coach [[Rudi Garcia]] and Simone Beccaccioli. Talks between the two clubs continued, where it was growing likely that the deal would officially be announced the following Monday.

Early membership consisted of the four founders and their friends. Interest in CAMRA and its objectives spread rapidly, with 5,000 members signed up by 1973. Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of ''Death of the English Pub'', who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of ''The Beer Drinker's Companion'', and later the many times ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'' editor, [[Roger Protz]].\n\nIn the 1980s, CAMRA was influential in campaigning against the \"Big Six\" breweries who had a stranglehold on the UK's pubs. The resulted in the [[The Beer Orders|The Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989]], more commonly known as the Beer Orders. The orders limited the number of pubs that a brewery could own but an unintended consequence was that many breweries ceased producing beer to focus solely on being pub-owning businesses or PubCos. In the late 1980s, CAMRA added cider campaigning to its remit with the creation of APPLE.\n\nIn 1991, CAMRA reached 30,000 members across the UK and abroad and, a year later, helped to launch the European Beer Consumers Union. CAMRA remains EBCU's largest contributor, despite the UK's exit from the European Union.\n\nOn 31 March 2016, founder Michael Hardman returned to chair a Revitalisation Project Steering Group. The aim of the Revitalisation Project was to review the organisation's purpose and future direction. Consultation meetings took place in the spring and summer of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/revitalisation/events|title=CAMRA's Revitalisation Project Events \u2013 CAMRA|website=CAMRA|language=en-GB|access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> and further discussion took place at the [[Bournemouth]] AGM and Conference in spring 2017 leading to possible refinement of proposals then subject to a final vote of all members at spring 2018's AGM and Conference. At that 2018 meeting, all but one of the proposed special resolutions were passed by voting, which all members could participate in. The failed special resolution related to a proposal for the Campaign to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub-goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers.\n\n==Aims==\nCAMRA's stated aims are:\n# To secure the long-term future of real ale, real cider and real perry by increasing their quality, availability and popularity\n#To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage\n#To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking\n#To play a leading role in the provision of information, education and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider and perry of any type\n#To ensure, where possible, that producers and retailers of beer, cider and perry act in the best interests of the customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|title=Archived copy|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163235/http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaigns&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/campaigns|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer, including [[Stout beer|stout]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], and [[Mild beer|mild]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Different Styles |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |accessdate=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729041918/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |archivedate=29 July 2013 }}</ref> as well as traditional [[cider]] and [[perry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Cider&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|accessdate=26 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122031136/http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|archivedate=22 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's states that real ale can only be served without the use of additional carbonation.

In recent times CAMRA has obtained benefits for its members from some commercial organisations and increasingly some licensed premises offer members price reductions on real ale (and sometimes cider and perry).\n\n==Publications and Websites==\nCAMRA publishes the ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'', an annually compiled directory of the best 4,500 real ale outlets and listing of real ale brewers.\nCAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''. In 2013 CAMRA launched public access to a national pub database, [http://www.whatpub.com WhatPub]. This database is maintained by local volunteers, covering all pubs in the UK and listing information such as opening times, location and beers available .It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs.\n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]\nCAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |title=List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals |access-date=25 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729002251/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Members often get discounted or free entrance to CAMRA festivals.\n\nThe Campaign also organises the annual [[Great British Beer Festival]] in August. It is now held in the Great, National & West Halls at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]], in [[Kensington]], London, having been held for a few years at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds. This is the UK's largest beer festival, with over 900 beers, ciders and perrys available over the week long event.\n\nFor many years, CAMRA also organised the National Winter Ales Festival. However, in 2017 this was re-branded as the Great British Beer Festival Winter. Unlike the Great British Beer Festival, the Winter event does not have a permanent venue and is rotated throughout the country every three years. Recent hosts have been Derby and Norwich, with the event currently held each February in Birmingham. In 2020 CAMRA also launched the Great Welsh Beer Festival, to be held in Cardiff in April.\n\n==Awards==\nCAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]]. The competition begins in the preceding year with branches choosing their local pub of the year through either a ballot or a panel of judges. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who agree the best using a scoring system that looks at beer quality, aesthetic, and welcome.

Early membership consisted of the four founders and their friends. Interest in CAMRA and its objectives spread rapidly, with 5,000 members signed up by 1973. Other early influential members included Christopher Hutt, author of ''Death of the English Pub'', who succeeded Hardman as chairman, Frank Baillie, author of ''The Beer Drinker's Companion'', and later the many times ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'' editor, [[Roger Protz]].\n\nIn the 1980s, CAMRA was influential in campaigning against the \"Big Six\" breweries who had a stranglehold on the UK's pubs. The resulted in the [[The Beer Orders|The Supply of Beer (Tied Estate) Order 1989]], more commonly known as the Beer Orders. The orders limited the number of pubs that a brewery could own but an unintended consequence was that many breweries ceased producing beer to focus solely on being pub-owning businesses or PubCos. In the late 1980s, CAMRA added cider campaigning to its remit with the creation of APPLE. \n\nIn 1991, CAMRA reached 30,000 members across the UK and abroad and, a year later, helped to launch the European Beer Consumers Union. CAMRA remains EBCU's largest contributor, despite the UK's exit from the European Union.  \n\nOn 31 March 2016, founder Michael Hardman returned to chair a Revitalisation Project Steering Group. The aim of the Revitalisation Project was to review the organisation's purpose and future direction. Consultation meetings took place in the spring and summer of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/revitalisation/events|title=CAMRA's Revitalisation Project Events \u2013 CAMRA|website=CAMRA|language=en-GB|access-date=25 April 2016}}</ref> and further discussion took place at the [[Bournemouth]] AGM and Conference in spring 2017 leading to possible refinement of proposals then subject to a final vote of all members at spring 2018's AGM and Conference. At that 2018 meeting, all but one of the proposed special resolutions were passed by voting, which all members could participate in. The failed special resolution related to a proposal for the Campaign to act as the voice and represent the interests of all pub-goers and beer, cider and perry drinkers.\n\n==Aims==\nCAMRA's stated aims are:\n# To secure the long term future of real ale, real cider and real perry by increasing their quality, availability and popularity\n#To promote and protect pubs and clubs as social centres as part of the UK's cultural heritage\n#To increase recognition of the benefits of responsible, moderate social drinking\n#To play a leading role in the provision of information, education and training to all those with an interest in beer, cider and perry of any type\n#To ensure, where possible, that producers and retailers of beer, cider and perry act in the best interests of the customer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|title=Archived copy|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615163235/http://www.camra.org.uk/press-releases/-/asset_publisher/CfaqMGfKvAEU/content/camra-members-vote-to-approve-change-following-largest-consultation-on-47-year-history|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's campaigns include promoting small brewing and pub businesses, reforming licensing laws, reducing tax on beer, and stopping continued consolidation among local British brewers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Campaigns&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/campaigns|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref> It also makes an effort to promote less common varieties of beer, including [[Stout beer|stout]], [[Porter (beer)|porter]], and [[Mild beer|mild]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Different Styles |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |accessdate=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729041918/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerstyles |archivedate=29 July 2013 }}</ref> as well as traditional [[cider]] and [[perry]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Cider&nbsp;\u2013 CAMRA|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|accessdate=26 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122031136/http://www.camra.org.uk/aboutcider|archivedate=22 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCAMRA's states that real ale can only be served without the use of additional carbonation.

In recent times CAMRA has obtained benefits for its members from some commercial organisations and increasingly some licensed premises offer members price reductions on real ale (and sometimes cider and perry).\n\n==Publications and Websites==\nCAMRA publishes the ''[[Good Beer Guide]]'', an annually compiled directory of the best 4,500 real ale outlets and listing of real ale brewers.\nCAMRA members receive a monthly newspaper called ''What's Brewing'' and a quarterly colour magazine called ''Beer''. In 2013 CAMRA launched public access to a national pub database, [http://www.whatpub.com WhatPub]. This database is maintained by local volunteers, covering all pubs in the UK and listing information such as opening times, location and beers available .It also maintains a [[CAMRA Pub Heritage Group|National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors]] to help bring greater recognition and protection to Britain's most historic pubs. \n\n==Festivals==\n[[File:GBBF 2.jpg|thumb|Great British Beer Festival 2004]]\nCAMRA supports and promotes beer and cider festivals around the country, which are organised by local CAMRA branches. Generally, each festival charges an entry fee which either covers entry only or also includes a commemorative glass showing the details of the festival. A festival programme is usually also provided, with a list and description of the drinks available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |title=List of upcoming CAMRA beer festivals |access-date=25 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729002251/http://www.camra.org.uk/beerfestivals |archive-date=29 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Members often get discounted or free entrance to CAMRA festivals.\n\nThe Campaign also organises the annual [[Great British Beer Festival]] in August. It is now held in the Great, National & West Halls at the [[Olympia, London|Olympia Exhibition Centre]], in [[Kensington]], London, having been held for a few years at [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earl's Court]] as well as regionally in the past at venues such as Brighton and Leeds. This is the UK's largest beer festival, with over 900 beers, ciders and perrys available over the week long event. \n\nFor many years, CAMRA also organised the National Winter Ales Festival. However, in 2017 this was re-branded as the Great British Beer Festival Winter. Unlike the Great British Beer Festival, the Winter event does not have a permanent venue and is rotated throughout the country every three years. Recent hosts have been Derby and Norwich, with the event currently held each February in Birmingham. In 2020 CAMRA also launched the Great Welsh Beer Festival, to be held in Cardiff in April. \n\n==Awards==\nCAMRA presents awards for beers and pubs, such as the [[National Pub of the Year]]. The competition begins in the preceding year with branches choosing their local pub of the year through either a ballot or a panel of judges. The branch winners are entered into 16 regional competitions which are then visited by several individuals who agree the best using a scoring system that looks at beer quality, aesthetic, and welcome. The four finalists are announced each year before a ceremony to crown the winner in the spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Article/2020/02/12/250-year-old-family-gem-wins-CAMRA-s-pub-of-the-year|title=250-year-old family gem wins CAMRA's pub of the year|last=morningadvertiser.co.uk|website=morningadvertiser.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref> There are also the [[Pub Design Awards]], which are held in association with [[English Heritage]] and the [[Victorian Society]].

The theme tune was by David Pringle, who also wrote opening music for ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Fun House (UK game show)|Fun House]]'' and ''[[The Pyramid Game]]''.\n\nTo end the first series, in 1989, the show was presented via satellite from Disneyland, California. Produced by Granada's Field Producer, Brian Thomas, the set was built directly in front of 'Sleeping Beauty Castle', a first for Disney.

Every year, each 20 year old has a chance of getting to the Offshore through a series of tests called \"the Process\", but only 3% make it. Michele is one of them, entering with her best friend Bruna. The head of the Process, Ezequiel, is observed by an Offshore woman named Aline. The first test is an interview, after which one candidate commits suicide out of frustration for failing. Fernando wonders if he will pass because he is in a wheelchair, but he does. After being placed into groups, a candidate named Joana notices another candidate, Rafael, has faked his registration. The second test is for each person to assemble nine cubes out of a collection of complex blocks. Rafael cheats, stealing a cube from another, but Ezequiel allows him to pass. Michele only has eight, but Fernando puts them all together to make a ninth, allowing them both to pass. Joana makes eleven cubes. Later Michele and Bruna are led to the back, as the Offshore suspects one of them is an infiltrated mole for a revolutionary group known as \"the Cause\". Michele convinces Bruna to attack the interrogator and Bruna is killed. The testers then assume that Bruna was the mole, although in fact it was Michele, who breaks down in tears for having caused her friend's death.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Chapter 02: Coins\n |DirectedBy      = Daina Giannecchini & Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = C\u00e1ssio Koshikumo & Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = When physically examined, Fernando is told that his legs can be healed at the Offshore, but he tells Michele he wishes to remain in his wheelchair, as his life would not be the same without it. The third test is a fake crime scene set in the Offshore. The group must figure out what happened here. At first it appears that the dummy woman is simply choking, but Fernando believes the choking woman was poisoned. The group agrees, but Rafael points out the clues are misleading, and the woman is actually having an allergic reaction to silver. Fernando eventually agrees, and they pass with Rafael's theory. Aline tracks down Ezequiel, who disappears for the fourth test. The next test involves voting who in the group will be kicked out; the winners take a coin to prove that they are moving on. Despite arguments, Marco suggests they draw scarf lengths to remain the most fair. Joana draws the shortest scarf but never returned her coin to the bag, stealing what should have been Lucas' spot.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Chapter 03: Corridor\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura & Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = The group must walk down a dark corridor together, but a gas is released that causes hallucinations.

Despite the effects being meant to wear off, \u00c1gata continues to hallucinate, and tries to kill Joana, but Rafael intervenes. Meanwhile, Ezequiel is shown to have been sneaking out to see a young boy named Augusto who lives in the Inland. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Joana accidentally killed a gangster's son, which prompted her to fake a registration as well in order to be allowed in the process and evade retaliation. Rafael notices her fake registration, and the two blackmail each other. When Augusto sneaks in and is almost caught by Aline, Ezequiel tells him to never come back.

While looking for a way out, Marco reflects on his family history, as each of them have successfully passed the Process and made it to the Offshore. He organizes everyone to get food and pass the test, and the group succeeds with ease. Ezequiel is displeased that they all have passed, and he decides to modify the test, no longer sending food to see how the candidates react. Eventually, Marco and some other men fashion weapons out of the beds to pry open the gate, and when they realize that there's no way out, they (notably Marco) assume that the test will be a survival of the fittest type with limited supplies. The group of men then attack the others who sat around rather than trying to pry the gate, stealing their food and taking them prisoner. Marco loses it as the candidates try to hide food, killing a girl. Meanwhile Michele and friends build a barricade to keep Marco's group out, while Joana escapes from the test by climbing a vent. Ezequiel meets her and explains that only she can stop the test, as he will not. Joana returns, freeing the people whom Marco subjected. Everyone violently attacks Marco's group, beating and presumably killing a few. The gates open and the prisoners escape, minus everyone in Marco's group. Marco attempts to flee, but the door catches him, presumably killing him or seriously maiming him; either way, he is eliminated. Meanwhile, Aline is caught snooping through Ezequiel's things, and it is revealed that Rafael attempted the Process last year and failed, before stealing the registry of his unconscious brother to take the Process for a second time. He also reveals to Michele that he is a mole for the Cause as well.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Chapter 05: Water\n |DirectedBy      = C\u00e9sar Charlone\n |WrittenBy       = Pedro Aguilera\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = Five years prior to the start of the series, Ezequiel becomes the head proctor for the 99th Process and onward.

During his first time in charge, she disqualifies a candidate who had done no wrong\u2014the candidate simply admitted to having a child. Later, she and Ezequiel monitor a raid, where a young boy is seen in the footage. J\u00falia breaks down in tears at the sight of the boy, and she later reveals to Ezequiel he is Augusto, the son she abandoned when she passed the Process. Throughout Ezequiel's time as head proctor, J\u00falia's behavior becomes more and more erratic until she attempts to escape to the Inland to see Augusto. Ezequiel stops her and has her committed to the Rehabilitation and Treatment Center, where she drowns herself in the ocean, committing the first suicide in the history of the Offshore. Ezequiel breaks down and goes to see Augusto himself, secretly beginning a relationship with the boy that continues today.

Michele and Rafael pass; Joana is confronted by a henchmen sent by the father of the boy she killed who entered her room posing as her father. He tells her she can either stay there and be killed or walk out with him and live, since the Process is offering more money than the price put on her head. She decides to stay and the man reveals himself to be a citizen of the Offshore, who tells her that she passed. Fernando goes through a reverse experience as his father tries to convince him to stay while he is willing to go back. He decides to carry on when his father tells him he will have nowhere to go if he returns. The remaining candidates head for their final, individual tests: Michele must tell Bruna's parents she is dead and convince them to allow their younger daughter to take part of the Process; Fernando must design a new test for the Process; and Rafael must seek help from another candidate in order to press two buttons at the same time. They all pass; Rafael made it with Fernando's help after revealing to him that he and Michele are both with the Cause. Ezequiel goes to tell Augusto he cannot see him anymore, and Aline agrees to keep Ezequiel's secret.

Michele poisons Ezequiel's drink using the poison from the capsule she removed from her hip, but he and C\u00e9sar inadvertently exchange their cups, resulting in C\u00e9sar being killed instead. Knowing he was the real target, Ezequiel interrogates all candidates individually and Rafael, who saw Michele's actions, drops the empty capsule over a railing. Ezequiel and C\u00e1ssia stage a fake confession from the captured Cause member they hold in which he names Aline as a fellow member, and she is arrested, suspected of the murder. In a final attempt to prove her innocence, she tries to send the Council some files incriminating Ezequiel, but Nair interferes and has her send them a positive report on him.

Meanwhile, Michele is actually being tortured by drowning and with a ''[[Pau de Arara#Torture technique|pau de arara]]''. Ezequiel reveals to her the only reason he hasn't killed her yet is because he was also a member of the Cause and knows what is like to be in her shoes. He also shows her footage of her brother alive and well and says she has been fooled. Michele finally reveals where she was supposed to meet the Cause leader and he is arrested, while she is still allowed to the Offshore. The \"purification\" ritual is revealed to be a sterilization procedure so that heritability is completely replaced by meritocracy. Rafael is shocked at first, but hesitantly proceeds anyway. Joana quits the Process when Ezequiel offers her to earn a position among his \u00e9lite by murdering a member of the gang which is after her. She meets Fernando as she leaves and they both express their frustration with the Process. Joana is last seen staring at some Cause graffiti and Fernando watches his father from afar.

Inland, Joana joins the Cause. She and another recruit are given a challenge to each create three suicide capsules from poisonous frogs; both fail as a result of Joana's refusal to help her partner. However, Joana helps Silas to find a secret note from the Old Man about what to do in the event of his death. The plan involves stealing fertilizer from Gerson. They are successful, though Joana is shot and they trigger a surveillance warning in doing so. Joana later learns that the Cause plans to plant a bomb in the next Process and is reluctant to accept that they are willing to kill so many innocent people. In the Offshore, Michele's brother Andr\u00e9 is kept as a prisoner as the first murderer in the history of the Offshore. Ezequiel offers to secure her brother's freedom if she works on his plan and creates a new test for the Process. The test is a maze of both transparent and mirror walls that move in unpredictable patterns, but Ezequiel quickly develops ways of finding the exit, even managing to trap her inside. Meanwhile, he faces strong opposition from the Process's head of security, Marcela ([[Laila Garin]]), who disdains him for having commanded Processes which approved Andr\u00e9 (a murder suspect) and Michele (a former member of the Cause). Following Joana's and Sila's actions, Ezequiel tasks Michele with infiltrating the Cause and spoiling their plans. \n |LineColor       = 383554\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Chapter 02: Toaster\n |DirectedBy      = Daina Giannecchini\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|4|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = After his arrival in the Offshore, Rafael attempts to build a radio to contact the Cause, but fails because the parts from Offshore are too advanced for what he needs. At a hookup party, Rafael seems uninterested in anyone, even rejecting a lady who is a \"87% match\", but hooks up with nurse Elisa, a 1.4% match. Rafael uses parts from Elisa's antique toaster and successfully builds the radio, but still fails to contact the Cause. Elisa catches Rafael using the radio but decides to let him off, informing him about the frequency block in the area. Rafael trains to become a soldier for the Process, and succeeds in passing the training mission after begging for a second chance. The test involved (initially unbeknownst to him) a simulation in which he is captured and tortured into confessing his true allegiance; he doesn't reveal his connection to the Cause even when Elisa is executed in front of him. It was all a plan Marcela had prepared to make sure he was loyal to the Offshore. Inland, Joana and Silas argue over the Cause's plan. Fernando works as the radio technician for his father's preachings, and helps candidates train for the Process. His childhood friend Gl\u00f3ria ([[Cynthia Senek]]) is turning 20 this year and plans to take part in the upcoming process.

Ezequiel instructs Michele to keep pretending to be a Cause infiltrator so as to locate the leaders and to get information on their bombing plan. During the registration for the upcoming Process, Fernando tries to warn Gl\u00f3ria and pleads for her not to join the Process, to which Gl\u00f3ria stomps off in anger, saying she rather die than be a quitter like him. At the Cause quarters, the members receive radio signals from Michele but Silas and Ivana (another important Cause member) fight over the credibility of the infiltrator, culminating in Silas destroying the radio. Joana takes the device to Fernando, and while he fixes it, he studies a register and comes up with a plan to stop the Process by wiping all the candidates' data. Rafael gets posted to build the Process and dopes his fellow comrade to take his ACU post, where he spots Michele undercover. Rafael then feigns being attacked to destroy his camera and tail Michele. Gl\u00f3ria spots Fernando working together with Joana and ends her friendship with Fernando. Fernando meets up with Michele after decoding her radio signals, and run away together when Silas tries to snipe them both.

Rafael admits to have fallen in love with an Offshore citizen and reveals their sterilization policy. Marcela, believing that Rafael was attacked and abducted by the Cause, soon arrives with her armed forces to rescue him. Michele plans to betray Ezequiel and escape with Joana and the others, but he allows Andr\u00e9 to communicate with her, causing her to back off. Ezequiel then instructs her to escape through a secret passageway while Ivana makes Rafael kill her in order for Rafael to keep up with his pretense as a loyal Offshore member.

Rafael decides to rat Michele out to Marcela, seeing how she was ready to betray him during the interrogation. Silas abruptly arrives at the hideout where Joana and Michele are, and is about to kill Michele when Ezequiel appears, claiming that he is there to save the Cause. Flashing back, a younger Ezequiel is ambitious and eager to infiltrate Offshore, a plan he devised himself. When he is told by the Old Man that he is not selected, Ezequiel becomes mad that the Cause questions his loyalty, throws a burning lamp at the Old Man and runs off. After succeeding in the Process, Ezequiel falls in love with J\u00falia, but she commits the Offshore's first suicide ever for being unable to see her son back at the Inland. Consumed by grief, Ezequiel takes it upon himself to destroy the Offshore. Back to the present, C\u00e1ssia and Marcela break into Ezequiel's station and listen into his conversation with the Cause members in the hideout. Ezequiel reveals that he wants to bring the Process and Council members down, creating a New World where there is no division. Ezequiel also reveals that he dictated the Old Man's note for him to write, meaning that bombing the Process is his idea, and that the flask that Michele carries is not to detonate the bomb, but to conceal it from security scanners. Joana and Michele are strongly against the idea of hurting masses of innocents but Silas agrees with Ezequiel. As Ezequiel and Michele head back to the Process quarters, Marcela has already sent troops out to capture the Cause members. Ezequiel is killed by Marcela, who proceeds to frame the Cause for it, and takes over Ezequiel's role as the Process Leader.

Meanwhile, Gl\u00f3ria has jitters about the upcoming Process. Using a device he stole from the registration booth, Fernando announces the truth about the sterilization process to the public as they celebrate the day of the Process, and this creates confusion and doubt among the Inland people. An Offshore soldier approaches Gl\u00f3ria to goad her into betraying Fernando in exchange for an advantage in the Process. Meanwhile, Joana and Michele successfully steals the bomb from Silas but Michele betrays the Cause for her brother by giving the bomb to Marcela. As she heads back to the Offshore, Marcela instructs C\u00e1ssia to pick her up when she arrives. Gl\u00f3ria meets Fernando in secret and argues with him, eventually coming to an agreement and they kiss. It is revealed that Fernando lost the ability to walk from falling off a building as he played with Gl\u00f3ria when they were children, even though she had a chance to warn him about the loose brick that caused his fall. He tells her he always knew it because her mother told him what happened. The Offshore soldiers find Fernando and he is locked up, thinking that Gl\u00f3ria sold him out. In charge of searching Fernando, Rafael allows him to pass the security check with a hidden radio.

Michele returns to the Offshore and is subjected to a simulation test to wipe her memories regarding the truth of Ezequiel's death, but she resists it and manages to wake herself up, knock C\u00e1ssia unconscious, set her brother free and escape with him. At the registration booth, Elisa tends to a man who refuses to cooperate and is taken aback when she sees his face. It turns out that Elisa had long ago found out about Rafael's fake identity (his actual name is Tiago) and when she confronted him, Rafael ultimately still withheld the truth about the Cause from her. She recognizes this man, the real Rafael, and clears him, who is now assuming a fake identity.

In a flashback, Marco is shown being treated by the Offshore medical team after he was maimed by heavy doors during the Process. He was sent back to the Inland after being set up with prosthetic legs and a walking stick but he was too ashamed to return to his family and attempted to join the militia instead. After surprising Gerson and passing his admission tests, he is granted a place, but following ten months, he's still treated like a maid. Gerson plans to publicly execute Joana, but she convinces Marco to let her go. When Gerson confronts him about doing so, Marco kills him, takes over the militia and goes back home, stating he will call the shots there from now on. He also arranges a meeting with Marcela, who is revealed to be his mother. He offers her vital information about the Cause's new plan in exchange for a second shot at the Process.

The rest of the population live in dire states and are on the brink of a civil war. Samira's father is one of the sponsors and he asks the Trio to expedite the migration even though the Offshore is not ready to sustain the large population yet. He suggests to make the scientists currently on the island to leave and the Trio refuses to comply, saying the Offshore is for competent people and not for rich morons to manipulate their way in. By blocking access to the island, Samira negotiates and requests the sponsors to build an Offshore unit in the Inland. However, La\u00eds and V\u00edtor are unwilling to go back to the Inland and start everything from scratch again and they suggest blowing up the Inland's power plant to destroy the banking data, causing the rich to lose their status. They argue and Samira gets killed. La\u00eds and V\u00edtor proceed their plan, forming the present day of Founding Couple and way of governance. In the present, Michele learns of the Founding Trio and Andr\u00e9 recovers his memory \u2014 he knew of the Founding Trio but stood by the Founding Couple's ideology hence, he did indeed commit a murder: he killed his mentor Olavo when he wanted to inform the Council about the truth. Later, Marcela subjected him to the memory suppression procedure used with Michele in the second-to-last episode in order to hide the truth and he was later locked up. Michele says the Offshore and the Process must end and leaves after hearing Rafael's plan over the comm, wearing the necklace she collected from Samara's skeleton, which contains a small shell. Rafael smuggles Joana into the Process facility and passes a ring to Fernando to break out and destroy the power supply, shutting down security cameras so that Joana can destroy the data while Rafael destroys the backup. Eventually, Fernando learns it was his own father who sold him out to the agents.\n |LineColor       = 383554\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 10\n |Title           = Chapter 10: Blood\n |DirectedBy      = Philippe Barcinski\n |WrittenBy       = Guilherme Freitas\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|4|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = Marcela tightens up security but Fernando manages to carry out his part successfully without being detected. However, Joana gets chased by Marco and Fernando has to take over her role. Fernando cuts himself to let his blood contaminate the data and becomes very weak from losing too much blood. Joana becomes trapped in Michele's glass maze, where she confronts and knocks Marco out. When he wakes up, Marcela says that was his \"second shot\" and expels him from the Process building, deeming him unworthy. He is last seen destroying objects in his house, including his mother's portrait. Joana rescues Fernando and goes into hiding with him. Meanwhile, Rafael has trouble accessing the backup data room, but Michele appears and claims that she wants to help them, opening the doors with the necklace. However, as they are in the room, Michele knocks Rafael unconscious. She then proceed to move the backup data to another storage device. At the same time, Marcela manages to restore the power supply, but all the data has already been wiped. Discontent begins to rise among the Process participants as they are denied entry due to the data loss and they break into the facility, clashing with Marcela and her agents. Joana and Fernando take the opportunity to escape among the chaos. Michele goes to meet Councilor Nair to make a deal for the backup data. Unaware that Michele sabotaged their plan, Joana and Fernando celebrate with the Cause. Rafael regains consciousness and contacts Joana, informing her about the sabotage and that the Process will be carrying on. After an argument of making hurtful jabs at each other, Rafael seems to have enough of everything and goes back to seek a reunion with Elisa. Back at the Process facility, the protesters are about to get gunned down when Councilor Nair announces the start of Process 105. It is revealed that Michele had made a deal to hold onto the data and only releasing it once a year during the Process, in exchange for Offshore supplies for the Inland. Marcela cruelly mocks Marco for failing once again. The Process candidates take their tests. Joana burns Silas' body. Rafael comes clean to Elisa. Michele invites Fernando to help her with her ultimate plan - to use the supplies to build a third, new location as an alternative to both the Inland and the Offshore: the Shell. \n |LineColor       = 383554\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2019)===\n{{Episode table |background=#F67011 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=17 |director=23 |writer=30 |airdate=20 |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Chapter 01: Sand\n |DirectedBy      = Daina Giannecchini\n |WrittenBy       = Denis Nielsen & Pedro Aguilera\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Michele succeeds in building the Shell, an alternative to both the Offshore and the Inland. When she switches the power on for the first time, reactions vary elsewhere. Joana says they are just another enemy; Fernando's father warns people against going there; Marco contemplates the light while one of his lieutenants comments that they'll lose power; and Marcela and Nair watch from the Offshore. Some time later, Fernando has been killed by pro-Offshore extremists when trying to invite people to the Shell and his wheelchair is kept on display inside the place as a monument to him; Elisa and Rafael are among the residents, now that Rafael's status as a Cause member was unveiled to the Offshore. Elisa acts as a nurse and Rafael drinks and does nothing all day, besides watching over his little brother Artur. Marco moved in with his son Mauricio, as well. One day, Joana visits the place and Xavier, a resident who belongs to a family whose members have never been able to pass the Process, shows her around and she insists to know more about the facility's generator. A massive sandstorm ravages the Shell, damaging its vital mechanisms, including the water collecting system, but Michele pleads the residents to join forces and rebuild the place, since their supplies are still intact. However, during Xavier's turn at watching over them, he is locked inside a room by a Shell drone and somebody steals almost all the food. Tension rises among residents as the Shell's unsustainability becomes obvious. Marco offers Michele the list of 20 people who left the Shell the night the supplies were stolen and suggests they go after them to retrieve the supplies. Gloria, on the other hand, recommends her to implement a new process to decide who's worthy of staying. Also, Andr\u00e9 and Marcela learn about the situation and offer to recover the place in exchange for ceding control of it to the Offshore. Michele ultimately decides to start a selection process to save the Shell by reducing its inhabitants to 10%. Those who stay should help rebuild it so that, later, everyone can be welcome again. As the selection's first test, people are told to remove their registers in order to cut all ties to the Offshore, leading some to abandon the selection and, consequently the Shell. Elisa offers Marco to be listed among residents who need medical treatment and who are consequently exempt from the selection, but he refuses. Joana grabs Michele's communicator from her and uses its shell to remove her register, promising to stay only \"to see her fall\".\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Chapter 02: Scalpel\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Carol Rodrigues\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Joana gathers all former Cause members and reveals that she wants to use the Shell's generator to destroy the Offshore with an EMP, but Natalia is initially reluctant and still believes in the Shell. Michele tells Joana about Marcela's offer and that she had refused it, and that the selection is the solution to save the Shell, but Joana is even less trustful of Michele now that she knows she's been in contact with the Offshore. Joana, Marco and Rafael pass their next test where they have to work as a trio in order to collectively overcome temporary disabilities to which each of them is subjected. The next test eliminates people based on how they react to failure; Ot\u00e1vio loses his mind over failing it and threatens to kill Michele with a blade. Joana manages to talk him out of it, but Rafael enters the room and tension re-erupts, culminating in Michele's throat being slit and Ot\u00e1vio committing suicide. Earlier in the episode, it is revealed that Ot\u00e1vio was Elisa's former lover, but their relationship came to an end when Elisa and Ot\u00e1vio passed and failed the Process, respectively. Joana has a chance to leave Michele for dead, but hesitates and saves her. Later, Natalia recognizes that the selection process messes with people's minds and agrees to help Joana with her plan. As Artur goes to sleep, he checks on a serious bruise on his left arm.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 21\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Chapter 03: Medicine\n |DirectedBy      = Daina Giannecchini\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = One year prior to the events of the season, the actual Rafael reveals his older brother's status as a Cause member, forcing him to grab Elisa and flee. Rafael goes back home for shelter, but his mother expels him. Artur follows him and begs him to take care of him, since he can't stand living with their mother anymore. Back to the present, Elisa attempts to contact the Offshore to check the possibility of coming back, but Andr\u00e9 takes the call and says she is not welcome there anymore now that she's a suspect of treason. Artur's condition worsens and he admits the bruise was caused after an ill-faded attempt to re-implant his register so he could one day go to the Offshore. Elisa treats him and realizes the register is broken, putting an end to his dream. While recovering, Michele assigns Elisa as her replacement in conducting the next test. Feeling better, she resumes work on the selection and prepares yet another step, which consists in trios deciding on a rule to expel someone in the trio in the next room. Gloria, Joana and Artur are up against Rafael, Natalia and Marco. After intense debating, Joana's group decides on a criterion based on whether the person has already killed someone (so that Marco is eliminated) while Rafael's group proposes (under his protests) a criterion based on age, with the youngest having to leave - so that Artur is eliminated. In the end, Michele reveals they will actually have to apply their criteria to their own groups, resulting in Joana's and Natalia's elimination. However, Artur ends up eliminated, as well, after Elisa tells Michele about the register. On his way out, he berates Rafael and later Elisa reveals she did it as payback for Rafael making her a treason suspect.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Chapter 04: Duck\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Andr\u00e9a Midori Sim\u00e3o\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Only 100 people are left in the Shell and rationing of meals is getting extreme. Michele intends to reduce the population by a half as a last selection. Duos are to presents ideas of a test and Michele chooses one. For Rafael and Marco, the test is a coin toss, Rafael's idea, and Marco loses. For Gloria and Xavier, the last candidates, the test is to assemble a puzzle box. Both finish virtually at the same time, but Michele decides Xavier was first. Marco goes live on the streets of the Inland with Mauricio and Gloria is told by Joana about Marcela's proposal. Gloria then goes meet Marcela, who suggests to her that she invades the Shell, and she is last seen communicating with the eliminated candidates to reveal the proposal Michele hid from everyone. In flashbacks, as the 10th Process was underway, it is shown how the early Offshore Council realized they were running out of supplies and that a method to further reduce the local population was urgent. The Founding Couple proposed the sterilization policy which is in use up to the present, but the Council wanted to expand it so it affected children born in the Offshore as well, resulting in all of them being sent to the Inland until they were 20 and became eligible to go through the Process. 11 years later, T\u00e2nia, the daughter of the Founding Couple, turned 20 and entered the Process, but failed her first test and was eliminated despite begging for her parents' mercy. Soon later, she is seen founding The Cause.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Chapter 05: Lever\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = One year ago, following the disbandment of the Militia, Marco leaves his house with Mauricio for the Shell, where he registers both without a surname. Back to the present, he resorts to stealing to feed his son, but his first attempt ends up with him being beaten up. He decides to leave the child back at home (where his maid Larissa can care for him) and joins Gloria, who's leading an uprising against the Shell. She even fantasizes about becoming a new Founding Couple together with Marco, although he isn't initially interested. Joana and Natalia try to talk her out of working with the Offshore, but they flee as Gloria threatens to hand them over to the Division. The duo find shelter in an abandoned bus, where Joana expresses frustration over letting so many people down and admits her involvement in Sila's death (see Season 2's [[3%#ep16|Chapter 08: Frogs]] for details), but Natalia insists she cares about others more than most. They almost share a kiss, but Joana resists. Soon after, they argue over what to do next and Natalia leaves her alone. Gloria and dozens of former Shell inhabitants march towards the place and force their way in while the remaining residents mount barricades to hold them off. Once Michele realizes they won't resist much longer, she reluctantly activates the Shell's defense mechanism (now that the generator is back and running) and Marco ends up electrocuted. He survives and Gloria's group take over the Shell while Michele flees alone. Rafael tries to take Elisa with him, but she says she'll stay even at the risk of having her memory wiped by Marcela as a punishment for her deserting, revealing she would rather forget about him. Rafael injures his foot while fleeing and is forced to hide inside the Shell. Meanwhile, it is revealed that one of the councilors is Marcela's father, and he is dying out of disappointment at Mauricio becoming unregistered. Marcela promises to solve the situation and preserve their family's honor and legacy. She informs Marco she will take over the Shell in 24 hours as he delivers a speech and is hailed by the Shell's population. Gloria mentions his surname, which the crowd echoes repeatedly and Marco accepts it again.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Chapter 06: Trapdoor\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = The Shell's population demand food and Marco offers it as a reward for whoever manages to capture Michelle, Joana, Rafael or Natalia. The latter is caught and locked up. Meanwhile, Elisa secretly treats Rafael's wound and is approached by Marco and Gloria, who offer her a place back at the Offshore if she reveals the fugitives' whereabouts. Andr\u00e9 later contacts her and confirms the proposal. Michele arrives at Joana's bus, but is told to leave. Joana investigates a piece of the Shell's water collecting system which she had found nearby earlier and realizes it had been sabotaged so the sandstorm would rip it off. She finds a passed out Michele far in the desert, reanimates her and discusses her discovery. They recognize their own mistakes and form a reluctant allegiance in order to take back the Shell, which is now heavily guarded by Gloria and Marco's henchpeople. Via radio, Michele instructs Rafael to open the trapdoor so she can secretly enter, but since he struggles to walk, he asks Elisa to do it instead, though she initially refuses. In order to buy time, Michele surrenders and is brought in. In flashbacks, Elisa and Ot\u00e1vio take part in the 99th Process and go through a test in which candidates have dinner and have to influence another person to do something before being influenced themselves. Andr\u00e9 approaches Elisa and offers her information on her target in exchange for information on Ot\u00e1vio, his target. Elisa eventually gives in and Andr\u00e9 successfully influences Ot\u00e1vio, causing him to be eliminated. Both Andr\u00e9 and Elisa would later be among the 3%. Back to the present, Elisa decides not to play the Offshore's game again and lets Joana in.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Chapter 07: Gardrone\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Ricardo Gon\u00e7alves\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gloria hosts a court on Michele and, despite the latter's pleads, the people declare her to be guilty and Gloria decides that the sentence will be to send her back to the Offshore so that her brain is erased. Before she leaves, she asks Gloria to remove Fernando's wheelchair from the Shell, since it is now becoming the exact opposite of what he envisioned; Gloria is later seen crying next to it. Constantly watched by Marco's henchman Wander, Elisa manages to sneak past and meet with Joana and Rafael. They figure out a specific saw was used to sabotage the Shell and Elisa pinpoints the exact date and time when the saboteur gained access to the tools' room, but the name is still unknown. They first suspect of Marco, but Elisa says he was undergoing treatment for his injuries that night. Then they suggest Gloria, but Rafael checks security footage of that night and it registers the sound of a [[rebec]], Gloria being the only person in the Shell capable of playing it. Elisa scans the saw for DNA and comes up with a list of ten people who touched the tool, Rafael and Xavier included. The latter is kidnapped for interrogation and suggests they look at the recording of the Gardrone. After Joana captures it, she witnesses Tadeu telling Gloria that \"they did it\". Artur deduces Rafael's hideout after spotting some grease on Elisa's sandals and meets him, but is convinced to stay to see the truth. When they all look at the Gardrone footage, they see Rafael with the saw, who is surprised. In flashbacks, Gloria is seen succeeding in the penultimate test of the Process. Marcela informs her that Fernando is about to die after being seriously beaten up as he tried to recruit people for the Shell and gives her a choice between continuing in the Process or abandoning it to treat him. Gloria choses the second option.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 26\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Chapter 08: Wave\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Andr\u00e9a Midori Sim\u00e3o & Pedro Aguilera\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Marcela meets her father, who insists his illness developed out of sheer frustration for Marco's failure in passing the Process and Mauricio's register removal. Rafael disputes being the saboteur, despite the footage showing otherwise. To make his situation worse, Artur says he witnessed him waking up and leaving the dorms the night the sandstorm happened. Because at that time the registers were still active, he has a theory that maybe he was remote-controlled. Records show that there was indeed a transmission at that time. When the (inaudible) transmission is replayed, Rafael gets up. After changing the speed of the recording, they hear \"get up, find a saw, cut the reeling cable\". In flashbacks, it is revealed that before being sold out by his brother (the actual Rafael), he was subjected to a memory investigation by Marcela, who found out about his alignment to the Cause. By exploiting his trauma of killing Ivana (see Season 2's [[3%#ep12|Chapter 04: Napkin]] for details), Marcela managed to create a coded, subliminal message that would cause Rafael to obey her orders to sabotage the Shell. Rafael and Joana show the recording to Marco and Gloria just as the Division arrives with food and water, but Gloria doesn't care, and Marco orders that they be locked up, and later says he destroyed the recording. Marcela re-implants a register on Mauricio, who is now renamed Leonardo, after Marcela's father. Wander tries to capture Elisa, but she tranquilizes him and frees everybody. While they run, Joana meets Marco, who hands her back the recording. Joana plays the recording for all to listen, and the Shell population turn against the Division, who is forced to leave in a hurry. Rafael is almost killed by a former Division mate, but Artur knocks her out and saves him. Andr\u00e9 and Michele stumble upon each other, recognize they are blinded by their respective ideologies and split. Marcela stays to try and retrieve her grandson, but she is caught and locked up, not before Marco tells his mother that his son is never going to the Offshore. She is given a meal inside her cage and finds among the food a note saying she has a female ally inside the Shell. Joana and Natalia reconcile and share a kiss. Gloria apologizes to Michele. Andre and the Division take over the Council and say \"now it's war\".

Every year, each 20 year old has a chance of getting to the Offshore through a series of tests called \"the Process\", but only 3% make it. Michele is one of them, entering with her best friend Bruna. The head of the Process, Ezequiel, is observed by an Offshore woman named Aline. The first test is an interview, after which one candidate commits suicide out of frustration for failing. Fernando wonders if he will pass because he is in a wheelchair, but he does. After being placed into groups, a candidate named Joana notices another candidate, Rafael, has faked his registration. The second test is for each person to assemble nine cubes out of a collection of complex blocks. Rafael cheats, stealing a cube from another, but Ezequiel allows him to pass. Michele only has eight, but Fernando puts them all together to make a ninth, allowing them both to pass. Joana makes eleven cubes. Later Michele and Bruna are led to the back, as the Offshore suspects one of them is an infiltrated mole for a revolutionary group known as \"the Cause\". Michele convinces Bruna to attack the interrogator and Bruna is killed. The testers then assume that Bruna was the mole, although in fact it was Michele, who breaks down in tears for having caused her friend's death.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Chapter 02: Coins\n |DirectedBy      = Daina Giannecchini & Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = C\u00e1ssio Koshikumo & Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = When physically examined, Fernando is told that his legs can be healed at the Offshore, but he tells Michele he wishes to remain in his wheelchair, as his life would not be the same without it. The third test is a fake crime scene set in the Offshore. The group must figure out what happened here. At first it appears that the dummy woman is simply choking, but Fernando believes the choking woman was poisoned. The group agrees, but Rafael points out the clues are misleading, and the woman is actually having an allergic reaction to silver. Fernando eventually agrees, and they pass with Rafael's theory. Aline tracks down Ezequiel, who disappears for the fourth test. The next test involves voting who in the group will be kicked out; the winners take a coin to prove that they are moving on. Despite arguments, Marco suggests they draw scarf lengths to remain the most fair. Joana draws the shortest scarf but never returned her coin to the bag, stealing what should have been Lucas' spot.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = Chapter 03: Corridor\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura & Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = The group must walk down a dark corridor together, but a gas is released that causes hallucinations.

Despite the effects being meant to wear off, \u00c1gata continues to hallucinate, and tries to kill Joana, but Rafael intervenes. Meanwhile, Ezequiel is shown to have been sneaking out to see a young boy named Augusto who lives in the Inland. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Joana accidentally killed a gangster's son, which prompted her to fake a registration as well in order to be allowed in the process and evade retaliation. Rafael notices her fake registration, and the two blackmail each other. When Augusto sneaks in and is almost caught by Aline, Ezequiel tells him to never come back.

While looking for a way out, Marco reflects on his family history, as each of them have successfully passed the Process and made it to the Offshore. He organizes everyone to get food and pass the test, and the group succeeds with ease. Ezequiel is displeased that they all have passed, and he decides to modify the test, no longer sending food to see how the candidates react. Eventually, Marco and some other men fashion weapons out of the beds to pry open the gate, and when they realize that there's no way out, they (notably Marco) assume that the test will be a survival of the fittest type with limited supplies. The group of men then attack the others who sat around rather than trying to pry the gate, stealing their food and taking them prisoner. Marco loses it as the candidates try to hide food, killing a girl. Meanwhile Michele and friends build a barricade to keep Marco's group out, while Joana escapes from the test by climbing a vent. Ezequiel meets her and explains that only she can stop the test, as he will not. Joana returns, freeing the people whom Marco subjected. Everyone violently attacks Marco's group, beating and presumably killing a few. The gates open and the prisoners escape, minus everyone in Marco's group. Marco attempts to flee, but the door catches him, presumably killing him or seriously maiming him; either way, he is eliminated. Meanwhile, Aline is caught snooping through Ezequiel's things, and it is revealed that Rafael attempted the Process last year and failed, before stealing the registry of his unconscious brother to take the Process for a second time. He also reveals to Michele that he is a mole for the Cause as well.\n |LineColor       = 92A89E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Chapter 05: Water\n |DirectedBy      = C\u00e9sar Charlone\n |WrittenBy       = Pedro Aguilera\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|11|25}}\n |ShortSummary    = Five years prior to the start of the series, Ezequiel becomes the head proctor for the 99th Process and onward.

During his first time in charge, she disqualifies a candidate who had done no wrong\u2014the candidate simply admitted to having a child. Later, she and Ezequiel monitor a raid, where a young boy is seen in the footage. J\u00falia breaks down in tears at the sight of the boy, and she later reveals to Ezequiel he is Augusto, the son she abandoned when she passed the Process. Throughout Ezequiel's time as head proctor, J\u00falia's behavior becomes more and more erratic until she attempts to escape to the Inland to see Augusto. Ezequiel stops her and has her committed to the Rehabilitation and Treatment Center, where she drowns herself in the ocean, committing the first suicide in the history of the Offshore. Ezequiel breaks down and goes to see Augusto himself, secretly beginning a relationship with the boy that continues today.

Michele and Rafael pass; Joana is confronted by a henchmen sent by the father of the boy she killed who entered her room posing as her father. He tells her she can either stay there and be killed or walk out with him and live, since the Process is offering more money than the price put on her head. She decides to stay and the man reveals himself to be a citizen of the Offshore, who tells her that she passed. Fernando goes through a reverse experience as his father tries to convince him to stay while he is willing to go back. He decides to carry on when his father tells him he will have nowhere to go if he returns. The remaining candidates head for their final, individual tests: Michele must tell Bruna's parents she is dead and convince them to allow their younger daughter to take part of the Process; Fernando must design a new test for the Process; and Rafael must seek help from another candidate in order to press two buttons at the same time. They all pass; Rafael made it with Fernando's help after revealing to him that he and Michele are both with the Cause.

Knowing he was the real target, Ezequiel interrogates all candidates individually and Rafael, who saw Michele's actions, drops the empty capsule over a railing. Ezequiel and C\u00e1ssia stage a fake confession from the captured Cause member they hold in which he names Aline as a fellow member, and she is arrested, suspected of the murder. In a final attempt to prove her innocence, she tries to send the Council some files incriminating Ezequiel, but Nair interferes and has her send them a positive report on him.

Meanwhile, Michele is actually being tortured by drowning and with a ''[[Pau de Arara#Torture technique|pau de arara]]''. Ezequiel reveals to her the only reason he hasn't killed her yet is because he was also a member of the Cause and knows what is like to be in her shoes. He also shows her footage of her brother alive and well and says she has been fooled. Michele finally reveals where she was supposed to meet the Cause leader and he is arrested, while she is still allowed to the Offshore. The \"purification\" ritual is revealed to be a sterilization procedure so that heritability is completely replaced by meritocracy. Rafael is shocked at first, but hesitantly proceeds anyway. Joana quits the Process when Ezequiel offers her to earn a position among his \u00e9lite by murdering a member of the gang which is after her. She meets Fernando as she leaves and they both express their frustration with the Process. Joana is last seen staring at some Cause graffiti and Fernando watches his father from afar.

Inland, Joana joins the Cause. She and another recruit are given a challenge to each create three suicide capsules from poisonous frogs; both fail as a result of Joana's refusal to help her partner. However, Joana helps Silas to find a secret note from the Old Man about what to do in the event of his death. The plan involves stealing fertilizer from Gerson. They are successful, though Joana is shot and they trigger a surveillance warning in doing so. Joana later learns that the Cause plans to plant a bomb in the next Process and is reluctant to accept that they are willing to kill so many innocent people. In the Offshore, Michele's brother Andr\u00e9 is kept as a prisoner as the first murderer in the history of the Offshore. Ezequiel offers to secure her brother's freedom if she works on his plan and creates a new test for the Process. The test is a maze of both transparent and mirror walls that move in unpredictable patterns, but Ezequiel quickly develops ways of finding the exit, even managing to trap her inside. Meanwhile, he faces strong opposition from the Process's head of security, Marcela ([[Laila Garin]]), who disdains him for having commanded Processes which approved Andr\u00e9 (a murder suspect) and Michele (a former member of the Cause).

At a hookup party, Rafael seems uninterested in anyone, even rejecting a lady who is a \"87% match\", but hooks up with nurse Elisa, a 1.4% match. Rafael uses parts from Elisa's antique toaster and successfully builds the radio, but still fails to contact the Cause. Elisa catches Rafael using the radio but decides to let him off, informing him about the frequency block in the area. Rafael trains to become a soldier for the Process, and succeeds in passing the training mission after begging for a second chance. The test involved (initially unbeknownst to him) a simulation in which he is captured and tortured into confessing his true allegiance; he doesn't reveal his connection to the Cause even when Elisa is executed in front of him. It was all a plan Marcela had prepared to make sure he was loyal to the Offshore. Inland, Joana and Silas argue over the Cause's plan. Fernando works as the radio technician for his father's preachings, and helps candidates train for the Process.

During the registration for the upcoming Process, Fernando tries to warn Gl\u00f3ria and pleads for her not to join the Process, to which Gl\u00f3ria stomps off in anger, saying she rather die than be a quitter like him. At the Cause quarters, the members receive radio signals from Michele but Silas and Ivana (another important Cause member) fight over the credibility of the infiltrator, culminating in Silas destroying the radio. Joana takes the device to Fernando, and while he fixes it, he studies a register and comes up with a plan to stop the Process by wiping all the candidates' data. Rafael gets posted to build the Process and dopes his fellow comrade to take his ACU post, where he spots Michele undercover. Rafael then feigns being attacked to destroy his camera and tail Michele. Gl\u00f3ria spots Fernando working together with Joana and ends her friendship with Fernando. Fernando meets up with Michele after decoding her radio signals, and run away together when Silas tries to snipe them both.

Under the guidance of Ezequiel, Michele successfully avoids exposing herself as the traitor (going as far as to reveal Ezequiel's past connection to the cause) and makes Joana and Fernando believe in her, although Ivana still trusts Rafael over her. Rafael admits to have fallen in love with an Offshore citizen and reveals their sterilization policy. Marcela, believing that Rafael was attacked and abducted by the Cause, soon arrives with her armed forces to rescue him. Michele plans to betray Ezequiel and escape with Joana and the others, but he allows Andr\u00e9 to communicate with her, causing her to back off. Ezequiel then instructs her to escape through a secret passageway while Ivana makes Rafael kill her in order for Rafael to keep up with his pretense as a loyal Offshore member.

Rafael decides to rat Michele out to Marcela, seeing how she was ready to betray him during the interrogation. Silas abruptly arrives at the hideout where Joana and Michele are, and is about to kill Michele when Ezequiel appears, claiming that he is there to save the Cause. Flashing back, a younger Ezequiel is ambitious and eager to infiltrate Offshore, a plan he devised himself. When he is told by the Old Man that he is not selected, Ezequiel becomes mad that the Cause questions his loyalty, throws a burning lamp at the Old Man and runs off. After succeeding in the Process, Ezequiel falls in love with J\u00falia, but she commits the Offshore's first suicide ever for being unable to see her son back at the Inland. Consumed by grief, Ezequiel takes it upon himself to destroy the Offshore. Back to the present, C\u00e1ssia and Marcela break into Ezequiel's station and listen into his conversation with the Cause members in the hideout. Ezequiel reveals that he wants to bring the Process and Council members down, creating a New World where there is no division. Ezequiel also reveals that he dictated the Old Man's note for him to write, meaning that bombing the Process is his idea, and that the flask that Michele carries is not to detonate the bomb, but to conceal it from security scanners. Joana and Michele are strongly against the idea of hurting masses of innocents but Silas agrees with Ezequiel. As Ezequiel and Michele head back to the Process quarters, Marcela has already sent troops out to capture the Cause members. Ezequiel is killed by Marcela, who proceeds to frame the Cause for it, and takes over Ezequiel's role as the Process Leader.

This causes unrest among the citizens. Among the hatred and fear for the Cause, Joana notes that the Cause is probably not to be blamed for Ezequiel's death, and Fernando suggests to reveal the sterilization process to the citizens in hopes to make them reconsider joining the Process while Joana and Michele discuss about ways to stop the bombing. Meanwhile, Gl\u00f3ria has jitters about the upcoming Process. Using a device he stole from the registration booth, Fernando announces the truth about the sterilization process to the public as they celebrate the day of the Process, and this creates confusion and doubt among the Inland people. An Offshore soldier approaches Gl\u00f3ria to goad her into betraying Fernando in exchange for an advantage in the Process. Meanwhile, Joana and Michele successfully steals the bomb from Silas but Michele betrays the Cause for her brother by giving the bomb to Marcela. As she heads back to the Offshore, Marcela instructs C\u00e1ssia to pick her up when she arrives. Gl\u00f3ria meets Fernando in secret and argues with him, eventually coming to an agreement and they kiss. It is revealed that Fernando lost the ability to walk from falling off a building as he played with Gl\u00f3ria when they were children, even though she had a chance to warn him about the loose brick that caused his fall. He tells her he always knew it because her mother told him what happened. The Offshore soldiers find Fernando and he is locked up, thinking that Gl\u00f3ria sold him out. In charge of searching Fernando, Rafael allows him to pass the security check with a hidden radio.

As Fernando remains locked in a cell, Rafael approaches him and insists that he did not betray the Cause, even though all of the Cause members have already strongly believe otherwise. Michele returns to the Offshore and is subjected to a simulation test to wipe her memories regarding the truth of Ezequiel's death, but she resists it and manages to wake herself up, knock C\u00e1ssia unconscious, set her brother free and escape with him. At the registration booth, Elisa tends to a man who refuses to cooperate and is taken aback when she sees his face. It turns out that Elisa had long ago found out about Rafael's fake identity (his actual name is Tiago) and when she confronted him, Rafael ultimately still withheld the truth about the Cause from her. She recognizes this man, the real Rafael, and clears him, who is now assuming a fake identity. When Rafael goes to the registration booth to learn about the data storage process from Elisa, she gets upset at him and it is revealed that his brother, the real Rafael, had stolen the identity of their another younger brother. As Elisa tells Rafael he started a \"tradition\" within his family and that she pities his youngest brother, who won't have anyone to steal the register from, a Cause member suddenly appears and tries to kill Rafael, but Rafael kills him first, not without injuring Elisa. Elisa survives and she begs Rafael to follow her and return to Offshore, to which he agrees only to leave her at the very end. Joana manages to free herself from captivity. While trying to escape the militia compound, Joana bumps into Marco, who is revealed to be alive following his failure in the previous Process (see [[3%#ep4|Chapter 04: Gateway]] for details).\n |LineColor       = 383554\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 16\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Chapter 08: Frogs\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|4|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = Marco chains Joana up, spewing words of hatred towards her as he feels that Joana is the one who brought the misery upon him. In a flashback, Marco is shown being treated by the Offshore medical team after he was maimed by heavy doors during the Process. He was sent back to the Inland after being set up with prosthetic legs and a walking stick but he was too ashamed to return to his family and attempted to join the militia instead. After surprising Gerson and passing his admission tests, he is granted a place, but following ten months, he's still treated like a maid. Gerson plans to publicly execute Joana, but she convinces Marco to let her go. When Gerson confronts him about doing so, Marco kills him, takes over the militia and goes back home, stating he will call the shots there from now on. He also arranges a meeting with Marcela, who is revealed to be his mother. He offers her vital information about the Cause's new plan in exchange for a second shot at the Process. Instructed by Fernando, who is able to use the radio Rafael ignored, Joana goes to the frog basement to meet Rafael but she sees Silas and it is revealed that Silas sold Joana out to obtain more fertilizer. Rafael arrives and Silas was about to shoot him when Joana pushes Silas away into the pond of frogs, and he dies from the poison.

The rest of the population live in dire states and are on the brink of a civil war. Samira's father is one of the sponsors and he asks the Trio to expedite the migration even though the Offshore is not ready to sustain the large population yet. He suggests to make the scientists currently on the island to leave and the Trio refuses to comply, saying the Offshore is for competent people and not for rich morons to manipulate their way in. By blocking access to the island, Samira negotiates and requests the sponsors to build an Offshore unit in the Inland. However, La\u00eds and V\u00edtor are unwilling to go back to the Inland and start everything from scratch again and they suggest blowing up the Inland's power plant to destroy the banking data, causing the rich to lose their status. They argue and Samira gets killed. La\u00eds and V\u00edtor proceed their plan, forming the present day of Founding Couple and way of governance. In the present, Michele learns of the Founding Trio and Andr\u00e9 recovers his memory \u2014 he knew of the Founding Trio but stood by the Founding Couple's ideology hence, he did indeed commit a murder: he killed his mentor Olavo when he wanted to inform the Council about the truth. Later, Marcela subjected him to the memory suppression procedure used with Michele in the second-to-last episode in order to hide the truth and he was later locked up. Michele says the Offshore and the Process must end and leaves after hearing Rafael's plan over the comm, wearing the necklace she collected from Samara's skeleton, which contains a small shell. Rafael smuggles Joana into the Process facility and passes a ring to Fernando to break out and destroy the power supply, shutting down security cameras so that Joana can destroy the data while Rafael destroys the backup.

However, Joana gets chased by Marco and Fernando has to take over her role. Fernando cuts himself to let his blood contaminate the data and becomes very weak from losing too much blood. Joana becomes trapped in Michele's glass maze, where she confronts and knocks Marco out. When he wakes up, Marcela says that was his \"second shot\" and expels him from the Process building, deeming him unworthy. He is last seen destroying objects in his house, including his mother's portrait. Joana rescues Fernando and goes into hiding with him. Meanwhile, Rafael has trouble accessing the backup data room, but Michele appears and claims that she wants to help them, opening the doors with the necklace. However, as they are in the room, Michele knocks Rafael unconscious. She then proceed to move the backup data to another storage device. At the same time, Marcela manages to restore the power supply, but all the data has already been wiped. Discontent begins to rise among the Process participants as they are denied entry due to the data loss and they break into the facility, clashing with Marcela and her agents.

Unaware that Michele sabotaged their plan, Joana and Fernando celebrate with the Cause. Rafael regains consciousness and contacts Joana, informing her about the sabotage and that the Process will be carrying on. After an argument of making hurtful jabs at each other, Rafael seems to have enough of everything and goes back to seek a reunion with Elisa. Back at the Process facility, the protesters are about to get gunned down when Councilor Nair announces the start of Process 105. It is revealed that Michele had made a deal to hold onto the data and only releasing it once a year during the Process, in exchange for Offshore supplies for the Inland. Marcela cruelly mocks Marco for failing once again. The Process candidates take their tests. Joana burns Silas' body. Rafael comes clean to Elisa.

When she switches the power on for the first time, reactions vary elsewhere. Joana says they are just another enemy; Fernando's father warns people against going there; Marco contemplates the light while one of his lieutenants comments that they'll lose power; and Marcela and Nair watch from the Offshore. Some time later, Fernando has been killed by pro-Offshore extremists when trying to invite people to the Shell and his wheelchair is kept on display inside the place as a monument to him; Elisa and Rafael are among the residents, now that Rafael's status as a Cause member was unveiled to the Offshore. Elisa acts as a nurse and Rafael drinks and does nothing all day, besides watching over his little brother Artur. Marco moved in with his son Mauricio, as well. One day, Joana visits the place and Xavier, a resident who belongs to a family whose members have never been able to pass the Process, shows her around and she insists to know more about the facility's generator. A massive sandstorm ravages the Shell, damaging its vital mechanisms, including the water collecting system, but Michele pleads the residents to join forces and rebuild the place, since their supplies are still intact. However, during Xavier's turn at watching over them, he is locked inside a room by a Shell drone and somebody steals almost all the food. Tension rises among residents as the Shell's unsustainability becomes obvious. Marco offers Michele the list of 20 people who left the Shell the night the supplies were stolen and suggests they go after them to retrieve the supplies. Gloria, on the other hand, recommends her to implement a new process to decide who's worthy of staying. Also, Andr\u00e9 and Marcela learn about the situation and offer to recover the place in exchange for ceding control of it to the Offshore. Michele ultimately decides to start a selection process to save the Shell by reducing its inhabitants to 10%. Those who stay should help rebuild it so that, later, everyone can be welcome again. As the selection's first test, people are told to remove their registers in order to cut all ties to the Offshore, leading some to abandon the selection and, consequently the Shell. Elisa offers Marco to be listed among residents who need medical treatment and who are consequently exempt from the selection, but he refuses.

Joana, Marco and Rafael pass their next test where they have to work as a trio in order to collectively overcome temporary disabilities to which each of them is subjected. The next test eliminates people based on how they react to failure; Ot\u00e1vio loses his mind over failing it and threatens to kill Michele with a blade. Joana manages to talk him out of it, but Rafael enters the room and tension re-erupts, culminating in Michele's throat being slit and Ot\u00e1vio committing suicide. Earlier in the episode, it is revealed that Ot\u00e1vio was Elisa's former lover, but their relationship came to an end when Elisa and Ot\u00e1vio passed and failed the Process, respectively. Joana has a chance to leave Michele for dead, but hesitates and saves her. Later, Natalia recognizes that the selection process messes with people's minds and agrees to help Joana with her plan.

Back to the present, Elisa attempts to contact the Offshore to check the possibility of coming back, but Andr\u00e9 takes the call and says she is not welcome there anymore now that she's a suspect of treason. Artur's condition worsens and he admits the bruise was caused after an ill-faded attempt to re-implant his register so he could one day go to the Offshore. Elisa treats him and realizes the register is broken, putting an end to his dream. While recovering, Michele assigns Elisa as her replacement in conducting the next test. Feeling better, she resumes work on the selection and prepares yet another step, which consists in trios deciding on a rule to expel someone in the trio in the next room. Gloria, Joana and Artur are up against Rafael, Natalia and Marco. After intense debating, Joana's group decides on a criteria based on whether the person has already killed someone (so that Marco is eliminated) while Rafael's group proposes (under his protests) a criteria based on age, with the youngest having to leave - so that Artur is eliminated. In the end, Michele reveals they will actually have to apply their criteria to their own groups, resulting in Joana's and Natalia's elimination. However, Artur ends up eliminated, as well, after Elisa tells Michele about the register. On his way out, he berates Rafael and later Elisa reveals she did it as payback for Rafael making her a treason suspect.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = Chapter 04: Duck\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Andr\u00e9a Midori Sim\u00e3o\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Only 100 people are left in the Shell and rationing of meals is getting extreme. Michele intends to reduce the population by a half as a last selection. Duos are to presents ideas of a test and Michele chooses one. For Rafael and Marco, the test is a coin toss, Rafael's idea, and Marco loses. For Gloria and Xavier, the last candidates, the test is to assemble a puzzle box. Both finish virtually at the same time, but Michele decides Xavier was first. Marco goes live on the streets of the Inland with Mauricio and Gloria is told by Joana about Marcela's proposal. Gloria then goes meet Marcela, who suggests to her that she invades the Shell, and she is last seen communicating with the eliminated candidates to reveal the proposal Michele hid from everyone. In flashbacks, as the 10th Process was underway, it is shown how the early Offshore Council realized they were running out of supplies and that a method to further reduce the local population was urgent. The Founding Couple proposed the sterilization policy which is in use up to the present, but the Council wanted to expand it so it affected children born in the Offshore as well, resulting in all of them being sent to the Inland until they were 20 and became eligible to go through the Process. 11 years later, T\u00e2nia, the daughter of the Founding Couple, turned 20 and entered the Process, but failed her first test and was eliminated despite begging for her parents' mercy. Soon later, she is seen founding The Cause.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 23\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = Chapter 05: Lever\n |DirectedBy      = Dani Libardi\n |WrittenBy       = Denis Nielsen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = One year ago, following the disbandment of the Militia, Marco leaves his house with Mauricio for the Shell, where he registers both without a surname. Back to the present, he resorts to stealing to feed his son, but his first attempt ends up with him being beaten up. He decides to leave the child back at home (where his maid Larissa can care for him) and joins Gloria, who's leading an uprising against the Shell. She even fantasizes about becoming a new Founding Couple together with Marco, although he isn't initially interested. Joana and Natalia try to talk her out of working with the Offshore, but they flee as Gloria threatens to hand them over to the Division. The duo find shelter in an abandoned bus, where Joana expresses frustration over letting so many people down and admits her involvement in Sila's death (see Season 2's [[3%#ep16|Chapter 08: Frogs]] for details), but Natalia insists she cares about others more than most. They almost share a kiss, but Joana resists. Soon after, they argue over what to do next and Natalia leaves her alone. Gloria and dozens of former Shell inhabitants march towards the place and force their way in while the remaining residents mount barricades to hold them off. Once Michele realizes they won't resist much longer, she reluctantly activates the Shell's defense mechanism (now that the generator is back and running) and Marco ends up electrocuted. He survives and Gloria's group take over the Shell while Michele flees alone. Rafael tries to take Elisa with him, but she says she'll stay even at the risk of having her memory wiped by Marcela as a punishment for her deserting, revealing she would rather forget about him. Rafael injures his foot while fleeing and is forced to hide inside the Shell. Meanwhile, it is revealed that one of the councilors is Marcela's father, and he is dying out of disappointment at Mauricio becoming unregistered. Marcela promises to solve the situation and preserve their family's honor and legacy. She informs Marco she will take over the Shell in 24 hours as he delivers a speech and is hailed by the Shell's population. Gloria mentions his surname, which the crowd echoes repeatedly and Marco accepts it again.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 24\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Chapter 06: Trapdoor\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Ivan Nakamura\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = The Shell's population demand food and Marco offers it as a reward for whoever manages to capture Michelle, Joana, Rafael or Natalia. The latter is caught and locked up. Meanwhile, Elisa secretly treats Rafael's wound and is approached by Marco and Gloria, who offer her a place back at the Offshore if she reveals the fugitives' whereabouts. Andr\u00e9 later contacts her and confirms the proposal. Michele arrives at Joana's bus, but is told to leave. Joana investigates a piece of the Shell's water collecting system which she had found nearby earlier and realizes it had been sabotaged so the sandstorm would rip it off. She finds a passed out Michele far in the desert, reanimates her and discusses her discovery. They recognize their own mistakes and form a reluctant allegiance in order to take back the Shell, which is now heavily guarded by Gloria and Marco's henchpeople. Via radio, Michele instructs Rafael to open the trapdoor so she can secretly enter, but since he struggles to walk, he asks Elisa to do it instead, though she initially refuses. In order to buy time, Michele surrenders and is brought in. In flashbacks, Elisa and Ot\u00e1vio take part in the 99th Process and go through a test in which candidates have dinner and have to influence another person to do something before being influenced themselves. Andr\u00e9 approaches Elisa and offers her information on her target in exchange for information on Ot\u00e1vio, his target. Elisa eventually gives in and Andr\u00e9 successfully influences Ot\u00e1vio, causing him to be eliminated. Both Andr\u00e9 and Elisa would later be among the 3%. Back to the present, Elisa decides not to play the Offshore's game again and lets Joana in.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 25\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Chapter 07: Gardrone\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Ricardo Gon\u00e7alves\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gloria hosts a court on Michele and, despite the latter's pleads, the people declare her to be guilty and Gloria decides that the sentence will be to send her back to the Offshore so that her brain is erased. Before she leaves, she asks Gloria to remove Fernando's wheelchair from the Shell, since it is now becoming the exact opposite of what he envisioned; Gloria is later seen crying next to it. Constantly watched by Marco's henchman Wander, Elisa manages to sneak past and meet with Joana and Rafael. They figure out a specific saw was used to sabotage the Shell and Elisa pinpoints the exact date and time when the saboteur gained access to the tools' room, but the name is still unknown. They first suspect of Marco, but Elisa says he was undergoing treatment for his injuries that night. Then they suggest Gloria, but Rafael checks security footage of that night and it registers the sound of a [[rebec]], Gloria being the only person in the Shell capable of playing it. Elisa scans the saw for DNA and comes up with a list of ten people who touched the tool, Rafael and Xavier included. The latter is kidnapped for interrogation and suggests they look at the recording of the Gardrone. After Joana captures it, she witnesses Tadeu telling Gloria that \"they did it\". Artur deduces Rafael's hideout after spotting some grease on Elisa's sandals and meets him, but is convinced to stay to see the truth. When they all look at the Gardrone footage, they see Rafael with the saw, who is surprised. In flashbacks, Gloria is seen succeeding in the penultimate test of the Process. Marcela informs her that Fernando is about to die after being seriously beaten up as he tried to recruit people for the Shell and gives her a choice between continuing in the Process or abandoning it to treat him. Gloria choses the second option.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 26\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n |Title           = Chapter 08: Wave\n |DirectedBy      = Jotag\u00e1 Crema\n |WrittenBy       = Andr\u00e9a Midori Sim\u00e3o & Pedro Aguilera\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|7}}\n |ShortSummary    = Marcela meets her father, who insists his illness developed out of sheer frustration for Marco's failure in passing the Process and Mauricio's register removal. Rafael disputes being the saboteur, despite the footage showing otherwise. To make his situation worse, Artur says he witnessed him waking up and leaving the dorms the night the sandstorm happened. Because at that time the registers were still active, he has a theory that maybe he was remote-controlled. Records show that there was indeed a transmission at that time. When the (inaudible) transmission is replayed, Rafael gets up. After changing the speed of the recording, they hear \"get up, find a saw, cut the reeling cable\". In flashbacks, it is revealed that before being sold out by his brother (the actual Rafael), he was subjected to a memory investigation by Marcela, who found out about his alignment to the Cause. By exploiting his trauma of killing Ivana (see Season 2's [[3%#ep12|Chapter 04: Napkin]] for details), Marcela managed to create a coded, subliminal message that would cause Rafael to obey her orders to sabotage the Shell. Rafael and Joana show the recording to Marco and Gloria just as the Division arrives with food and water, but Gloria doesn't care, and Marco orders that they be locked up, and later says he destroyed the recording. Marcela re-implants a register on Mauricio, who is now renamed Leonardo, after Marcela's father. Wander tries to capture Elisa, but she tranquilizes him and frees everybody. While they run, Joana meets Marco, who hands her back the recording. Joana plays the recording for all to listen, and the Shell population turn against the Division, who is forced to leave in a hurry. Rafael is almost killed by a former Division mate, but Artur knocks her out and saves him. Andr\u00e9 and Michele stumble upon each other, recognize they are blinded by their respective ideologies and split. Marcela stays to try and retrieve her grandson, but she is caught and locked up, not before Marco tells his mother that his son is never going to the Offshore. She is given a meal inside her cage and finds among the food a note saying she has a female ally inside the Shell. Joana and Natalia reconcile and share a kiss. Gloria apologizes to Michele. Andre and the Division take over the Council and say \"now it's war\". Marco, Rafael, Xavier, Gloria, Elisa, Michele, Natalia and Joana discuss a defense plan and agree that they should attack first, by destroying the Offshore with an EMP, just like the Founding Couple did with the Continent.\n |LineColor       = F67011\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCreator and writer Pedro Aguilera developed ''3%'' from a 2009 independent [[pilot episode]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thacker.diraol.eng.br/mirrors/www.cultura.gov.br/site/2009/06/10/fictvmais-cultura-6/|title=Minist\u00e9rio da Cultura - MinC \" Resultado do FICTV/Mais Cultura|last=Mesquita|first=Marcelo|website=thacker.diraol.eng.br|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Netflix gave the series an 8-episode order for the first season.<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.facebook.com/netflixbrasil/videos/973614829361977/?comment_id=973912195998907&reply_comment_id=973915855998541&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D ''Netflix Brasil''] Facebook page.</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|last=Vaquer|first=Gabriel|title=Netflix anuncia estreia de s\u00e9rie brasileira \"3%\" para novembro|url=http://natelinha.uol.com.br/series/2016/09/05/netflix-anuncia-estreia-de-serie-brasileira-3_porcento-para-novembro-101878.php|website=NaTelinha|publisher=[[Universo Online]]|date=September 5, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016|language=Portuguese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906212234/http://natelinha.uol.com.br/series/2016/09/05/netflix-anuncia-estreia-de-serie-brasileira-3_porcento-para-novembro-101878.php|archive-date=2016-09-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is the first Portuguese-language [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix|Netflix original series]] and the second non-English production, after the Spanish-language series ''[[Club de Cuervos]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9100661/netflix-3-percent-original-programming-brazil|title=Netflix's newest original series is a dystopian thriller in Brazil|last=Cox|first=Jamieson|date=August 5, 2015|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Cinematography|cinematographer]] [[C\u00e9sar Charlone (cinematographer)|C\u00e9sar Charlone]], known for ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' and ''[[Blindness (2008 film)|Blindness]]'', served as [[Film director|director]] alongside Daina Giannecchini, Dani Libardi, and Jotag\u00e1 Crema.

In [[1977 Denver Broncos season|1977]], four years later, they qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history and advanced to [[Super Bowl XII]].

However, Homer complains that he wanted to own the [[Dallas Cowboys]], as the Broncos team that just arrived are playing very sloppy football on his front lawn (a reference to the team losing four Super Bowl appearances, three by significant margins including [[Super Bowl XII]] against Dallas). Incidentally, the Broncos were 13\u20133 in the 1996 season, and won the Super Bowl the next two seasons. Only two seasons later in the Super Bowl-centric episode \"[[Sunday, Cruddy Sunday]]\", Homer chooses Denver as his [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] pick over Moe's choice of the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. In the episode, \"[[The Bonfire of the Manatees]]\", Homer picks the Broncos to win the Super Bowl over the [[Seattle Seahawks]].
