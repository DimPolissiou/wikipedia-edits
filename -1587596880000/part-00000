Kiryu is a [[yakuza]] who takes the blame for his boss' death to protect his best friend, resulting in his expulsion from the clan and a ten-year stay in prison. After leaving prison, Kiryu realizes the crime world has changed and fights against the new threats in his life. He is voiced by [[Takaya Kuroda]] in Japanese and by [[Darryl Kurylo]] in the English version of the first game.\n\nKiryu was created to appeal to a broad audience, and was the series' playable character during its first three games.

Writer Hasei Seishu told the staff the positions were too high for his age and thus Kiryu's age was revised. When describing Kiryu, the staff found his position would be of the noble samurai type who would often protect others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|title=A Heart-To-Heart With Yakuza's Development Team|website=1UP.com|date=October 9, 2008|author=Gifford, Kevin|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701161732/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|archivedate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> According to Sega producer [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|title=Ryu Ga Gotoku Update|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|website=IGN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222226/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|archivedate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> When the spin-off ''Yakuza Kenzan'' was released, he commented that the tale of Kazuma Kiryu had yet to be completed.

Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for ''Yakuza 3'' was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game. Due to Kiryu taking care of the orphans, Yokoyama feared the character became too kind.<ref name=\"kuroda\">{{cite book|title=Ryu ga Gotoku 3 Guidebook|pages=522\u2013527}}</ref>\n\nAcross all these games, the development team developed a sturdy understanding of his personality, and there was a lot of effort put into making the character attractive to the audiences as a result of being the only playable character. By ''Yakuza 4'', Kiryu was seen as \"indestructible\" by the staff, and as a result, he was made the last character playable in the game, following three new characters that stood out thanks to their different traits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|title=Interview: Defining Direction, Writing, Art And Music On Yakuza 4|website=Gamasutra|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329100644/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> In localizing the games, the character was often referred to by his first name, but by ''Yakuza 4'', producer Yasuhiro Noguchi made him most commonly called Kiryu in an attempt to make him fit with the other main characters also called by their last names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|title=Yakuza 4 producer Yasuhiro Noguchi on re-localizing the series|publisher=Joystiq|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408231529/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|archivedate=April 8, 2014}}</ref> For ''Yakuza 5'', while once again there were other protagonists alongside Kiryu, a new one, Haruka, was added as playable for the first time in order to make her character arc connect with the role of Kiryu and the other characters.

Sega described Kiryu as a \"straight man trait \u2013 tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit\" implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game, ''Kiwami'', the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions while being both friends and enemies at the same time. ''Yakuza 0'' also served as a story of Kiryu that Sega wanted players to know before reaching ''Yakuza 6''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/21/sega-on-the-challenges-of-bringing-yakuza-0-west.aspx|title=How Sega Brought Yakuza 0 To The West|date=February 21, 2017|magazine=Game Informer|accessdate=October 30, 2017|author=Gwaltney, Javy}}</ref> Kiryu's traits in ''Yakuza 0'' were specifically changed to a \"loose-cannon hot-head\" to the point long time fans would be surprised by his actions.

They compared the character with [[James Bond]] whose actor changed multiple times across his movies. Describing him as \"a super-cool and masculine guy, but since he's a well-established character with a specific personality, there are things that he would and wouldn't do\" the team decided he would need a successor who would bring the staff more creativity to work with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-creator-talks-007-inspirations-wacky-humor-/1100-6451146/|title=Yakuza Creator Talks 007 Inspirations, Wacky Humor, And What's Next|website=GameSpot|accessdate=October 28, 2017|date=June 24, 2017}}</ref> In late 2016, Nagoshi claimed he had been doing Kazuma's story for nearly a decade, stating \"it had its pros and cons\".

In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in different styles.

game]] series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]''. Kiryu is a [[yakuza]] who takes the blame for his boss' death to protect his best friend, resulting in his expulsion from the clan and a ten-year stay in prison. After leaving prison, Kiryu realizes the crime world has changed and fights against the new threats in his life. He is voiced by [[Takaya Kuroda]] in Japanese and by [[Darryl Kurylo]] in the English version of the first game.\n\nKiryu was created to appeal to a broad audience, and was the series' playable character during its first three games. Critical reception to Kiryu has been generally positive, and he is often considered a [[PlayStation]] mascot.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gallagher|first1=Simon|title=10 Characters We Want To See In Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale|url=http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-characters-we-want-to-see-in-playstation-all-stars-battle-royale|website=What Culture|accessdate=30 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730151201/http://whatculture.com/gaming/10-characters-we-want-to-see-in-playstation-all-stars-battle-royale|archivedate=30 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Robert|title=Feature: 5 Reasons Why Kazuma Kiryu Is the Hardest Man on PlayStation|url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2017/01/feature_5_reasons_why_kazuma_kiryu_is_the_hardest_man_on_playstation|website=Pushsquare|publisher=Gamernetwork|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref> Several have praised how Kiryu, despite identifying as a yakuza, stood out because of his kindness and [[character arc|character development]] across the series' story. On the other hand, he has also been viewed as a somewhat typical gaming protagonist.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn creating Kazuma Kiryu, there were some issues regarding how realistic his position and age were. Writer Hasei Seishu told the staff the positions were too high for his age and thus Kiryu's age was revised. When describing Kiryu, the staff found his position would be of the noble samurai type who would often protect others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|title=A Heart-To-Heart With Yakuza's Development Team|website=1UP.com|date=October 9, 2008|author=Gifford, Kevin|accessdate=March 28, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701161732/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&cId=3153161|archivedate=July 1, 2016}}</ref> According to Sega producer [[Toshihiro Nagoshi]], dragons have a strong image about them, and that when players sample it, they would, as the title suggests, get a feel for the strength and manliness of the main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|title=Ryu Ga Gotoku Update|date=September 11, 2005|accessdate=May 10, 2014|website=IGN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222226/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/09/11/ryu-ga-gotoku-update|archivedate=May 12, 2014}}</ref> When the spin-off ''Yakuza Kenzan'' was released, he commented that the tale of Kazuma Kiryu had yet to be completed.

Furthermore, Nagoshi said this difference is shown across the series. Nagoshi thanked staff member Yokoyama that the team could further develop Kiryu's appeal across the franchise. The inclusion of Kiryu running an orphanage for ''Yakuza 3'' was enjoyed by Yokoyama despite rewriting this subplot multiple times. Originally, Kiryu was meant to go to prison once again but because it was going to be obvious they changed his story in this game. Due to Kiryu taking care of the orphans, Yokoyama feared the character became too kind.<ref name=\"kuroda\">{{cite book|title=Ryu ga Gotoku 3 Guidebook|pages=522\u2013527}}</ref>\n\nAcross all these games, the development team developed a sturdy understanding of his personality, and there was a lot of effort put into making the character attractive to the audiences as a result of being the only playable character. By ''Yakuza 4'', Kiryu was seen as \"indestructible\" by the staff, and as a result, he was made the last character playable in the game, following three new characters that stood out thanks to their different traits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|title=Interview: Defining Direction, Writing, Art And Music On Yakuza 4|website=Gamasutra|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=March 28, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329100644/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35429/Interview_Defining_Direction_Writing_Art_And_Music_On_Yakuza_4.php|archivedate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> In localizing the games, the character was often referred to by his first name, but by ''Yakuza 4'', producer Yasuhiro Noguchi made him most commonly called Kiryu in an attempt to make him fit with the other main characters also called by their last names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|title=Yakuza 4 producer Yasuhiro Noguchi on re-localizing the series|publisher=Joystiq|date=June 28, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408231529/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/04/13/yakuza-4-producer-yasuhiro-noguchi-on-re-localizing-the-series/|archivedate=April 8, 2014}}</ref> For ''Yakuza 5'', while once again there were other protagonists alongside Kiryu, a new one, Haruka, was added as playable for the first time in order to make her character arc connect with the role of Kiryu and the other characters.

Sega described Kiryu as a \"straight man trait \u2013 tough but honorable and keeps to himself a bit\" implying there are not too many difficulties in writing him. Through this game and the remake of the first game, ''Kiwami'', the relationship between Kiryu and Majima becomes more explored in contrast to the initial game of the franchise, most notably because of the changes made to Majima's characterization and the way he sees Kiryu's actions while being both friends and enemies at the same time. ''Yakuza 0'' also served as a story of Kiryu that Sega wanted players to know before reaching ''Yakuza 6''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/02/21/sega-on-the-challenges-of-bringing-yakuza-0-west.aspx|title=How Sega Brought Yakuza 0 To The West|date=February 21, 2017|magazine=Game Informer|accessdate=October 30, 2017|author=Gwaltney, Javy}}</ref> Kiryu's traits in ''Yakuza 0'' were specifically changed to a \"loose-cannon hot-head\" to the point long time fans would be surprised by his actions.

They compared the character with [[James Bond]] whose actor changed multiple times across his movies. Describing him as \"a super-cool and masculine guy, but since he's a well-established character with a specific personality, there are things that he would and wouldn't do\" the team decided he would need a successor who would bring the staff more creativity to work with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yakuza-creator-talks-007-inspirations-wacky-humor-/1100-6451146/|title=Yakuza Creator Talks 007 Inspirations, Wacky Humor, And What's Next|website=GameSpot|accessdate=October 28, 2017|date=June 24, 2017}}</ref> In late 2016, Nagoshi claimed he had been doing Kazuma's story for nearly a decade, stating \"it had its pros and cons\".

However, he regrets some lines were lost in translation of the original game. Nevertheless, Kurylo enjoyed the experience to the point of playing the game multiple times alongside his son. In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in different styles. Kurylo still found more fun when doing the yells for the fight scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tojohq.github.io/interview-darryl-kurylo/|title=TojoHQ Interviews - Darryl Kurylo|publisher=TojoHQ|accessdate=September 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nNogashi was impressed by Kiryu's Japanese voice actor, [[Takaya Kuroda]], due to how he sang in the music minigame.

Near the end of the race, Bull rams into Joe's car, which results in Joe hitting Lui's car into the sea.\n\nJoe, terrified that he killed Lui, tells Ann what happened and Ann is upset at him until he leaves to turn himself in but she stops him and pleads him not to turn himself in. Katy arrives at Ann's home and Joe sneaks out through the window. Bull arrives afterwards and orders a gun on the phone to kill Joe and seek revenge for Lui. Katy then arrives at Joe's shop to warn him but his colleague do not trust her and abuse her until Joe arrives to stop them. Katy then returns to Ann's home where Bull is finds out about their plan is is enraged. At this moment, Joe arrives and Bull chases him down with a gun down the parking lot but Joe manages to knock his gun down and fight him. During this critical moment, Lui, who survived to crash, arrives to stop Bull but is too late when Bull manages to pick up his gun and shoots Joe, who dies in Ann's arms. Afterwards, Bull admits his greed for the HK$500,000 and is the cause of all this by ramming into Joe and Lui berates him for his impulsiveness. Bull then tries to make amends and lures the cops into a shootout, but Lui saves him in a car and drives out the parking lot when the police fire at them, eventually flipping the car.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Jacky Cheung]] as Lui\n*[[Max Mok]] as Joe\n*[[Rachel Lee]] as Ann\n*[[Ellen Chan]] as Katy\n*Karel Wong as Bull\n*[[Wu Ma]] as Lui's father\n*[[Lung Fong]] as Brother Bing\n*Ma Kei\n*Billy Ching\n*James Ha\n*Leung Sap-yat\n*Hung Chi-ming\n*Scott Kam\n*Lam Chi-wa\n*Ng Kwok-kin as Uncle Fei\n*Chiu Jun-chiu as Policeman\n\n==Theme song==\n*''Street Hero'' (\u99ac\u8def\u82f1\u96c4)\n**Composer: T.

Animals use their [[teeth]] to grind food down into smaller particles, increasing the surface area available for digestion. The epithelial tissue lining the digestive tract contains [[microvilli]], greatly increasing the area available for absorption. [[Elephant]]s have large [[ear]]s, allowing them to regulate their own body temperature. In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Thus, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

In other instances, animals will need to minimize surface area; for example, people will fold their arms over their chest when cold to minimize heat loss.\n\nThe [[surface area to volume ratio]] (SA:V) of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] imposes upper limits on size, as the volume increases much faster than does the surface area, thus limiting the rate at which substances diffuse from the interior across the [[cell membrane]] to interstitial spaces or to other cells. Indeed, representing a cell as an idealized [[sphere]] of radius ''r'', the volume and surface area are, respectively, ''V'' = 4/3 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>3</sup>; ''SA'' = 4 \u03c0 ''r''<sup>2</sup>. The resulting surface area to volume ratio is therefore 3/''r''. Thus, if a cell has a radius of 1 \u03bcm, the SA:V ratio is 3; whereas if the radius of the cell is instead 10 \u03bcm, then the SA:V ratio becomes 0.3. With a cell radius of 100, SA:V ratio is 0.03. Thus, the surface area falls off steeply with increasing volume.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Perimeter length]]\n* [[BET theory]], technique for the measurement of the specific surface area of materials\n* [[Spherical area]]\n* [[Surface integral]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references />\n\n* {{eom|title=Area|id=A/a013180|author=Yu.D.

Immediately afterwards, Ibrahim sent 5000 soldiers to the plains of [[Argos]] in order to seize [[Nafplion]]. When Ibrahim's forces reached the mills of Lerna on June 24, Captain Makrygiannis and Minister of War Metaxas organized a resistance force containing 350 Greek soldiers ([[Walter Alison Phillips]] places the number at 250<ref>Phillips, p. 179.</ref>). General [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]], Konstantinos Mavromichalis, Panagiotis Rodios and several [[philhellenes]] (such as Fran\u00e7ois Graillard and Heinrich Treiber) volunteered in the defense of the garrison.<ref name=\"Finlay, pp. 78-79\"/>\n\nProtecting Lerna was vital since the mills contained large quantities of grain that supplied food to Nafplion. The mills of Lerna were surrounded by a stone wall that was flanked by a deep pond and a marsh. Moreover, the garrison was supported by two gunboats that were anchored a short distance (or \"musket-shot distance\") from the shore. Unfortunately, the Greeks did not repair a small break in the stone wall. As a result, a small contingent of [[Arabs]] exploited this weakness in the defensive structure and attempted to create an entrance by increasing the size of the break. When the Arabs forced themselves through the break, they were prevented from regrouping once they entered the courtyard. Thirteen Arabs were killed by a charge of Greeks and philhellenes led by Makrygiannis. Ultimately, the remaining Arabs in the overall contingent were forced to flee. The Greeks, afterwards, attempted to fill in the gap in the stone wall. Despite the constant reinforcements he received, Ibrahim was aware of the fact that the Greeks were prepared to staunchly defend the Lerna Mills and he eventually retreated to the plains of Argos. From there, Ibrahim took his army to Tripolitsa on June 29, 1825.<ref name=\"Finlay, pp. 78-79\"/>\n\nGeneral Makriyannis in his Memoirs provides a vivid description of the situation before and during the battle. He and his corps were defending Neokastro and Palaiokastro in Methoni until surrendered under conditions to Ibrahim due to thirst and exhaustion. He came to defend the position first with selected members of his company and then came Ypsilantis and Mavromihalis but they had very few people with them. After Makriyannis it was Gikas that brought his band and later Liakopoulos came from Nafplion with 50 people.\nThe position was weak and they were very few compared to Ibrahim's army. Thus many were eager to leave using their horses or by fish boats but Makriyannis made sure all horses and fish boats were gone in secret. This made everybody more resolute in defending the position and they started digging trenches. Admiral De Rigny watched from aboard the helplessness of the Greeks and advised Makriyannis against defending the position but Makriyannis ignored him by saying: \n\n\"They are many indeed but we few have decided to die and have God on our side... And when the few decide to die, most times win... And if we die today we will die for our country and our religion and this death is a good one\". \"Tres bien\" replied De Rigny.\n\nThe first wave of the Egyptians was repelled successfully and this made some French naval officers to come ashore and congratulate Makriyannis. He was indeed that day the heart of the defenders in Myloi and he was eager to help wherever there was need. Thus he was shot in the right hand from musket fire but kept it secret until the end of the battle. He claims he was recognized by some of Ibrahim's shooters that remembered him from Neokastro. He was taken to the French frigate of Admiral De Rigny to be treated afterwards.\nHe estimated the Egyptian losses to 500-600 dead and more wounded. Greek casualties were 2 dead and 2 wounded.\nIn his account of the battle he praises all the defenders who \"fought that day like lions\" in a desperate struggle to repel Ibrahim and save Nafplion. \n\n==See also==\n*[[List of battles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Finlay, George.

They are known for poor brakes, and cannot go faster than about 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph). The vehicle often carries more than 20 people at a time in remote locations and poor road conditions. Today, a ''jugaad'' is one of the most cost-effective transportation solutions for rural Indians.\n\nThough no statistical data is available, it is reported that there are a number of instances of failing brakes, requiring a passenger to jump off and manually apply a wooden block as a brake. As part of research for his 2013 book, Innovation and a Global Knowledge Economy in India, Thomas Birtchnell, a lecturer of Sustainable Communities at [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]], found that of 2,139 cases of road traffic casualties in 72 hours at J N Medical College hospital in [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]], 13.88% of pedestrian casualties were due to ''jugaad''.

Hence, no [[road tax]] is paid on them, neither there exists any official count of such vehicles.\n\n''Jugaads'' are not officially recognized as road-worthy, and despite a few proposals to regulate them, [[Votebank|vote-bank politics]] have trumped safety concerns.

[[India]] has recognized the word \"Jugaad\" as the abbreviation of \"Justified Guideline to Achieve the Desired State\".\n\nAccording to author and professor [[Jaideep Prabhu]], ''jugaad'' is an \"important way out of the current economic crisis in developed economies and also holds important lessons for emerging economies\".<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/cambridge-expert-says-indian-jugaad-is-lesson-to-world/story-M3q6vFu8tEPj8eSNsAJo5M.html</ref>\n\nJugaad is often confused as \"Jugaar\", which is not correct, as its pronunciation comes from the last letter \"\u0921\u093c\", and not \"\u0930\".\n\n==Etymology and variants==\nIt is pronounced as ''jugaad'' or ''jugaadh'' in [[Hindi]], while in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu]] it is spelled as ''jagaad''. Themselves derived from \"Yog(a)\", meaning \"joining\" or \"union\", a cognate of \"[[yoke]]\". In [[Tamil language|Tamil]] it is translated as \u0b89\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd.\n\nAnother view is that the word originates from the [[Sanskrit word]] \"yukti\" which means \"a solution (to a problem) \".\n\nJugaad roughly corresponds to do-it-yourself ([[DIY]]) in the [[United States|US]], hacking or a bodge in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], urawaza (\u88cf\u6280) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], tapullo in parts of [[Italy]], ''z\u00eczh\u01d4 chu\u00e0ngx\u012bn'' (\u81ea\u4e3b\u521b\u65b0) in [[China]], Trick 17 in [[Germany]], ''gambiarra'' in [[Brazil]], ''syst\u00e8me D.'' in [[France]], or ''jua kali'' in [[Kenya]]; in addition, equivalent words within South Africa are ''\u2019n boer maak \u2019n plan'' in [[Afrikaans]], ''izenzele'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]],  ''iketsetse'' in [[Sotho language|Sotho]], and ''itirele'' in [[Tswana language|Tswana]].<ref>Angus Donald Campbell \u201c[http://www.angusdonaldcampbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/006_DESI_a_00424_Campbell_WEB_vB.pdf Lay Designers: Grassroots Innovation for Appropriate Change]\u201d, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], 2017</ref>\n\n==Low-cost vehicle==\n''Jugaad'' can also refer to a [[quadricycle]], a means of transportation in north India, made of wooden planks and old <!-- Deliberate link to relevant section of disambiguation page -->[[Jeep (disambiguation)#Jeep-type vehicles|jeep]] parts, variously known as ''kuddukka'' and ''pietereda.'' However, ''jugaad'' could be used as a term for any low cost vehicle which typically costs around Rs. 50,000 (about US$800).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Companies/Bt7C5EnNrvRyoqZAERSbMN/Rural-India8217s-jugaad-for-cheap-travel.html|title=Rural India's jugaad for cheap travel - Livemint|website=www.livemint.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}</ref> ''Jugaads'' are powered by diesel engines originally intended to power agricultural [[irrigation]] pumps. They are known for poor brakes, and cannot go faster than about 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph). The vehicle often carries more than 20 people at a time in remote locations and poor road conditions. Today, a ''jugaad'' is one of the most cost-effective transportation solutions for rural Indians.\n\nThough no statistical data is available, it is reported that there are a number of instances of failing brakes, requiring a passenger to jump off and manually apply a wooden block as a brake. As part of research for his 2013 book, Innovation and a Global Knowledge Economy in India, Thomas Birtchnell, a lecturer of Sustainable Communities at [[University of Wollongong]], [[Australia]], found that of 2,139 cases of road traffic casualties in 72 hours at J N Medical College hospital in [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh|Aligarh]], 13.88% of pedestrian casualties were due to ''jugaad''. It was stated by Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways [[Pon Radhakrishnan]] that ''jugaads'' do not conform to the specifications of a Motor Vehicle under the [[Motor Vehicles Act, 1988]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/one-hack-of-a-vehicle/|title=One hack of a vehicle|date=2015-10-25|website=The Indian Express|access-date=2016-04-09}}</ref> These vehicles hence do not have any [[vehicle registration plate]] and they are not registered with the [[Regional Transport Office]] (RTO). Hence, no [[road tax]] is paid on them, neither there exists any official count of such vehicles.\n\n''Jugaads'' are not officially recognized as road-worthy, and despite a few proposals to regulate them, [[Votebank|vote-bank politics]] have trumped safety concerns. The improvised vehicles have now become rather popular as a means to transport all manner of burdens, from lumber to steel rods to school children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://becauseitreallyispersonal.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/india-school-bus-tricycle.jpg|title=Bal Mandir Public School Transportation}}</ref> For safety reasons the government of India has officially banned ''jugaad'' vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Govt issues order to seize jugaads|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-03-21/jaipur/28116564_1_jugaads-govt-issues-order-transport|work=The Times of India|publisher=indiatimes.com|accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nA variant of the ''jugaad'' vehicle in [[Tamil Nadu]] in South India is the ''Meen Body Vandi.''

The part of the software that caused the interruption in the inertial system computers is used before launch to align the inertial reference system and, in Ariane 4, also to enable a rapid realignment of the system in case of a late hold in the countdown. This realignment function, which does not serve any purpose on Ariane 5, was nevertheless retained for commonality reasons and allowed, as in Ariane 4, to operate for approximately 40 seconds from lift-off.\n# During design of the software of the inertial reference system used for Ariane 4 and Ariane 5, a decision was taken that it was not necessary to protect the inertial system computer from being made inoperative by an excessive value of the variable related to the horizontal velocity, a protection provided for several other variables of the alignment software. When taking this design decision, it was not analysed or fully understood which values this particular variable might assume when the alignment software was allowed to operate after lift-off.\n# In Ariane 4 flights using the same type of inertial reference system there had been no such failure because the trajectory during the first 40 seconds of flight is such that the particular variable related to horizontal velocity cannot reach, with an adequate operational margin, a value beyond the limit present in the software.\n# Ariane 5 has a high initial acceleration and trajectory, which leads to a build-up of horizontal velocity five times more rapid than for Ariane 4. The higher horizontal velocity of Ariane 5 generated, within the 40-second timeframe, the excessive value that caused the inertial system computers to cease operation.\n# The purpose of the review process, which involves all major partners in the Ariane 5 programme, is to validate design decisions and to obtain flight qualification. In this process, the limitations of the alignment software were not fully analysed and the possible implications of allowing it to continue to function during flight were not realised.\n# The specification of the inertial reference system and the tests performed at equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane 5 trajectory data. Consequently, the realignment function was not tested under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions, and the design error was not discovered.\n# It would have been technically feasible to include almost the entire inertial reference system in the overall system simulations which were performed. For a number of reasons it was decided to use the simulated output of the inertial reference system, not the real system or its detailed simulation. Had the system been included, the failure could have been detected.\n# Post-flight simulations have been carried out on a computer with software of the inertial reference system and with a simulated environment, including the actual trajectory data from the Ariane 501 flight. These simulations have faithfully reproduced the chain of events leading to the failure of the inertial reference systems.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the failure, four replacement [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster II]] satellites were built. These were launched in pairs aboard [[Soyuz-U]]/[[Fregat]] rockets in 2000.\n\nThe launch failure brought the high risks associated with complex computing systems to the attention of the general public, politicians, and [[corporate officer|executives]], resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of [[safety-critical system]]s. The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane [[source code|code]] (written in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]) was the first example of large-scale [[static code analysis]] by [[abstract interpretation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=PolySpace Technologies History | last=Faure | first=Christ\u00e8le | url=http://christele.faure.pagesperso-orange.fr/polyspace.html | accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe failure also harmed the excellent success record of the European Space Agency's rocket family, set by the high success rate of the Ariane 4 model. It was not until 2007 that Ariane 5 launches were recognised as being as reliable as those of the predecessor model.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last = Todd\n  | first = David \n  | title = ASCEND Space Intelligence News\n  | date = March 2007\n  }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mars Climate Orbiter#The metric.2FUS customary units mix-up|Mars Climate Orbiter]] software that had been adapted from an earlier Mars Climate Orbiter was not adequately tested before launch\n* [[Apollo Guidance Computer#PGNCS trouble|Apollo guidance computer \u2013 PGNCS trouble]], another case where a spacecraft guidance computer suffered from having a subsystem inappropriately left running\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Thomas, L.D.

The failure has become known as one of the most infamous and expensive [[software bug]]s in history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gleick|first=James|title=A Bug and A Crash|url=http://www.around.com/ariane.html|work=New York Times Magazine|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=1 December 1996}}</ref>  The failure resulted in a loss of more than US$370 million.<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Ariane 5 Software Failure |date=March 1997 | volume = 22 | journal = Software Engineering Notes | last = Dowson | first = M. | pages  = 84 | doi = 10.1145/251880.251992 | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nCluster consisted of four {{convert|1200|kg}} cylindrical, [[spin-stabilisation|spin-stabilised]] spacecraft, powered by 224 watt solar cells.

The part of the software that caused the interruption in the inertial system computers is used before launch to align the inertial reference system and, in Ariane 4, also to enable a rapid realignment of the system in case of a late hold in the countdown. This realignment function, which does not serve any purpose on Ariane 5, was nevertheless retained for commonality reasons and allowed, as in Ariane 4, to operate for approximately 40 seconds from lift-off.\n# During design of the software of the inertial reference system used for Ariane 4 and Ariane 5, a decision was taken that it was not necessary to protect the inertial system computer from being made inoperative by an excessive value of the variable related to the horizontal velocity, a protection provided for several other variables of the alignment software. When taking this design decision, it was not analysed or fully understood which values this particular variable might assume when the alignment software was allowed to operate after lift-off.\n# In Ariane 4 flights using the same type of inertial reference system there had been no such failure because the trajectory during the first 40 seconds of flight is such that the particular variable related to horizontal velocity cannot reach, with an adequate operational margin, a value beyond the limit present in the software.\n# Ariane 5 has a high initial acceleration and trajectory, which leads to a build-up of horizontal velocity five times more rapid than for Ariane 4. The higher horizontal velocity of Ariane 5 generated, within the 40-second timeframe, the excessive value that caused the inertial system computers to cease operation.\n# The purpose of the review process, which involves all major partners in the Ariane 5 programme, is to validate design decisions and to obtain flight qualification. In this process, the limitations of the alignment software were not fully analysed and the possible implications of allowing it to continue to function during flight were not realised.\n# The specification of the inertial reference system and the tests performed at equipment level did not specifically include the Ariane 5 trajectory data. Consequently, the realignment function was not tested under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions, and the design error was not discovered.\n# It would have been technically feasible to include almost the entire inertial reference system in the overall system simulations which were performed. For a number of reasons it was decided to use the simulated output of the inertial reference system, not the real system or its detailed simulation. Had the system been included, the failure could have been detected.\n# Post-flight simulations have been carried out on a computer with software of the inertial reference system and with a simulated environment, including the actual trajectory data from the Ariane 501 flight. These simulations have faithfully reproduced the chain of events leading to the failure of the inertial reference systems.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the failure, four replacement [[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster II]] satellites were built. These were launched in pairs aboard [[Soyuz-U]]/[[Fregat]] rockets in 2000.\n\nThe launch failure brought the high risks associated with complex computing systems to the attention of the general public, politicians, and [[corporate officer|executives]], resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of [[safety-critical system]]s. The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane [[source code|code]] (written in [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]]) was the first example of large-scale [[static code analysis]] by [[abstract interpretation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=PolySpace Technologies History | last=Faure | first=Christ\u00e8le | url=http://christele.faure.pagesperso-orange.fr/polyspace.html | accessdate=3 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe failure also harmed the excellent success record of the European Space Agency's rocket family, set by the high success rate of the Ariane 4 model. It was not until 2007 that Ariane 5 launches were recognised as being as reliable as those of the predecessor model.<ref>{{Cite news\n  | last = Todd\n  | first = David \n  | title = ASCEND Space Intelligence News\n  | date = March 2007\n  }}</ref>{{Verify source|date=June 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mars Climate Orbiter#The metric.2FUS customary units mix-up|Mars Climate Orbiter]] software that had been adapted from an earlier Mars Climate Orbiter was not adequately tested before launch\n* [[Apollo Guidance Computer#PGNCS trouble|Apollo guidance computer \u2013 PGNCS trouble]], another case where a spacecraft guidance computer suffered from having a subsystem inappropriately left running\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Thomas, L.D.

It is closely related to the [[fusor]], the [[high beta fusion reactor]], the [[magnetic mirror]], and the [[biconic cusp]]. A set of [[electromagnets]] generates a magnetic field that traps [[electrons]]. This creates a negative voltage, which attracts positive [[ions]]. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their [[kinetic energy]] rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can [[nuclear fusion|fuse]].\n\nThe polywell is one of many devices that use an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Miley | first1=George H. | last2=Murali | first2=S.

The outer cage has a positive [[voltage]] versus the inner cage. A fuel, typically, [[deuterium]] gas, is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its [[Ionization energy|ionization temperature]], making positive [[ion]]<nowiki/>s. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly through the center of the device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, a [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] impels them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes [[Thermal conduction|conduct]] mass and energy away from the plasma, as well as spall off metal ions into the gas, which cools it.\n\nIn fusors, the [[potential well]] is made with a wire cage. Because most of the ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]] losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even.\n\n[[File:Fusor Mechanism.png|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 1''': Illustration of the basic mechanism of fusion in fusors. (1) The fusor contains two concentric wire cages. The cathode (blue) is inside the anode (red). (2) Positive ions are attracted to the inner cathode.

It can be defined separately for electrons and ions. The polywell concerns itself only for the electron beta, whereas the ion beta is of greater interest within Tokamak and other neutral-plasma machines. The two vary by a very large ratio, because of the enormous difference in mass between an electron and any ion. Typically in other devices the electron beta is neglected, as the ion beta determines more important plasma parameters. This is a significant point of confusion for scientists more familiar with more 'conventional' fusion plasma physics.\n\nNote that for the electron beta, only the electron number density and temperature are used, as both of these, but especially the latter, can vary significantly from the ion parameters at the same location.\n\n<math>\\beta_e = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\frac{n_e k_B T_e}{(B^2/2\\mu_0)}</math><ref>Wesson, J: \"Tokamaks\", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>\n\nMost experiments on polywells involve [[Beta (plasma physics)|low-beta plasma]] regimes (where ''\u03b2'' < 1),<ref name=\"Low beta confinement in a Polywell modeled with conventional point cusp theories\" /> where the plasma [[pressure]] is weak compared to the [[magnetic pressure]].

Sharply bent fields were used by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in a series of magnetic mirror machines from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a [[tokamak]]. Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist.\n\nIn June 2014 EMC2 published a preprint<ref name=\"Park 2014\" /> providing evidence that the effect is real, based on x-ray measurements and magnetic flux measurements during its experiment.\n\nAccording to Bussard, typical cusp leakage rate is such that an electron makes 5 to 8 passes before escaping through a cusp in a standard mirror confinement biconic cusp; 10 to 60 passes in a polywell under mirror confinement (low beta) that he called cusp confinement; and several thousand passes in Wiffle-Ball confinement (high beta).<ref name=\"EMC2-0191-02\">{{cite techreport |last1=Bussard |first1=Robert W. |last2=Krall |first2=Nicholas A. |title=Electron Leakage Through Magnetic Cusps in the Polywell Confinement Geometry |number=EMC2-0191-02 |institution=EMC2-DARPA |date=February 1991 |url=http://www.askmar.com/Fusion_files/EMC2%20Reports%20Reformatted/EMC2-0191-02%20Electron%20Leakage.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"IAC2006\" />\n\nIn February 2013, [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]] announced a new compact fusion machine, the [[high beta fusion reactor]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400 | title=Lockheed Martin announces compact Fusion Reactor plans |website=FuseNet | date=17 April 2013 | author=M.

All [[chemical element]]s can be fused; for elements with fewer protons than iron, this process changes [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass into energy]] that can potentially be captured to provide [[fusion power]].\n\nThe [[probability]] of a fusion reaction occurring is controlled by the [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of the fuel,<ref>\"Development of the indirect drive approach to inertial confinement fusion and the target physics basis for ignition and gain\" John Lindl, Physics of Plasma, 1995</ref> which is in turn a function of its temperature. The easiest nuclei to fuse are [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. Their fusion occurs when the ions reach 4 keV ([[kiloelectronvolt]]s), or about 45 million [[kelvin]]s. The Polywell would achieve this by accelerating an ion with a charge of [[Elementary charge|1]] down a 4,000 volt electric field. The high cost, short [[half-life]] and [[radioactive|radioactivity]] of [[tritium]] make it difficult to work with.\n\nThe second easiest reaction is to fuse [[deuterium]] with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium is commonly used by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse [[boron|boron-11]] with protons; this reaction is [[Aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]] (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-<sup>11</sup>B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using [[direct energy conversion]]. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency<ref>\u201cExperimental Results from a beam direct converter at 100 kV\u201d journal of fusion energy, Volume 2, Number 2, (1982) by R. W. MOIR, W. L.

To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly enough to make up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] and [[radiation]].<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> Conduction is when [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s or [[neutral particle|neutrals]] touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.\n\n'''Net Power = Efficiency &times; (Fusion &minus; Radiation Loss &minus; Conduction Loss)'''\n\n* Net Power \u2014 power output\n* Efficiency \u2014 fraction of energy needed to drive the device and convert it to electricity.\n* Fusion \u2014 energy generated by the fusion reactions.\n* Radiation \u2014 energy lost as light, leaving the plasma.\n* Conduction \u2014 energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma.\n\nLawson used this equation to estimate conditions for net power<ref name=\"Lawson\" /> based on a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] cloud.<ref name=\"Lawson\" />\n\nHowever, the Lawson criterion does not apply for Polywells if Bussard's conjecture that the plasma is nonthermal is correct. [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|Lawson]] stated in his founding report:<ref name=\"Lawson\" /> \"It is of course easy to postulate systems in which the velocity distribution of the particle is not Maxwellian. These systems are outside the scope of this report.\" He also ruled out the possibility of a nonthermal plasma to ignite: ''\"Nothing may be gained by using a system in which electrons are at a lower temperature [than ions]. The energy loss in such a system by transfer to the electrons will always be greater than the energy which would be radiated by the electrons if they were the [same] temperature.\"''\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nTodd Rider<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ll.mit.edu/60thAnniversary/rider.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314223354/http://www.ll.mit.edu/60thAnniversary/rider.html |archive-date=2017-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> calculated that [[bremsstrahlung|X-ray radiation]] losses with this fuel would exceed fusion power production by at least 20%.

In 1995 he sent a letter to the [[United States Congress|US Congress]] stating that he had only supported Tokamaks in order to get fusion research sponsored by the government, but he now believed that there were better alternatives.\n\n=== EMC2, Inc. ===\n\nBussard founded Energy/Matter Conversion Corporation, Inc. (aka EMC2) in 1985<ref name=\"google\"/><ref name=\"patent1989\" /> and after the HEPS program ended, the company continued its research. Successive machines were made, evolving from WB-1 to WB-8. The company won an [[SBIR]] I grant in 1992\u201393 and an [[SBIR]] II grant in 1994\u201395, both from the US Navy.<ref name=\"quick\" /> In 1993, it received a grant from the [[Electric Power Research Institute]].<ref name=\"quick\" /> In 1994, The company received small grants from [[NASA]] and [[LANL]].<ref name=\"quick\"/> Starting in 1999, the company was primarily funded by the US Navy.<ref name=\"quick\"/>\n\nWB-1 had six conventional [[magnet]]s in a cube. This device was 10&nbsp;cm across.<ref name=\"quick\"/> WB-2 used coils of wires to generate the magnetic field. Each [[electromagnet]] had a square cross section that created problems. The [[magnetic]] fields drove electrons into the metal rings, raising conduction losses and electron trapping. This design also suffered from \"funny cusp\" losses at the joints between magnets. WB-6 attempted to address these problems, by using circular rings and spacing further apart.<ref name=\"google\"/> The next device, PXL-1, was built in 1996 and 1997. This machine was 26&nbsp;cm across and used flatter rings to generate the field.<ref name=\"quick\"/> From 1998 to 2005 the company built a succession of six machines: WB-3, MPG-1,2, WB-4, PZLx-1, MPG-4 and WB-5. All of these reactors were six magnet designs built as a cube or [[truncated cube]]. They ranged from 3 to 40&nbsp;cm in radius.<ref name=\"quick\"/>\n\nInitial difficulties in spherical electron confinement led to the 2005 research project's termination.

He also stated that the density would scale with the square of the field (constant [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] conditions), and the maximum attainable magnetic field would scale with the radius. Under those conditions, the fusion power produced would scale with [[Power law|the seventh power of]] the radius, and the energy gain would scale with the fifth power. While Bussard did not publicly document the reasoning underlying this estimate,<ref>\nPossibly he assumed that the ion energy distribution is fixed, that the magnetic field scales with the linear size, and that the ion pressure (proportional to density) scales with the [[magnetic pressure]] (proportional to ''B''\u00b2). The ''R''<sup>7</sup> scaling results from multiplying the fusion power density (proportional to density squared, or ''B''<sup>4</sup>) with the volume (proportional to''R''\u00b3). On the other hand, if it is important to maintain the ratio of the [[Debye length]] or the [[gyroradius]] to the machine size, then the magnetic field strength would have to scale ''inversely'' with the radius, so that the total power output would actually be lower in a larger machine.</ref> if true, it would enable a model only ten times larger to be useful as a fusion power plant.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/>\n\n==== WB-6 ====\n\nFunding became tighter and tighter. According to [[Bussard]], \"The funds were clearly needed for the more important [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|War in Iraq]].\"<ref name=\"randi\"/> An extra $900k of [[Office of Naval Research]] funding allowed the program to continue long enough to reach WB-6 testing in November 2005. WB-6 had rings with circular cross sections that space apart at the joints. This reduced the metal surface area unprotected by magnetic fields. These changes dramatically improved system performance, leading to more electron recirculation and better electron confinement, in a progressively tighter core. This machine produced a fusion rate of 10<sup>9</sup> per second. This is based on a total of nine neutrons in five tests, giving a wide confidence interval.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/><ref name=\"lab_notes\"/> Drive voltage on the WB-6 tests was about 12.5 kV, with a resulting potential well depth of about 10 kV.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/> Thus deuterium ions could have a maximum of 10 keV of kinetic energy in the center. By comparison, a [[Fusor]] running deuterium fusion at 10 kV would produce a fusion rate almost too small to detect. [[Robert L. Hirsch|Hirsch]] reported a fusion rate this high only by driving his machine with a 150 kV drop between the inside and outside cages.<ref>Robert L. Hirsch, \"Inertial-Electrostatic Confinement of Ionized Fusion Gases\", Journal of Applied Physics, v. 38, no. 7, October 1967</ref> Hirsch also used [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], a much easier fuel to fuse, because it has a higher [[nuclear cross section]].\n\nWhile the WB-6 pulses were sub-millisecond, Bussard felt the physics should represent steady state. A last-minute test of WB-6 ended prematurely when the insulation on one of the hand-wound [[electromagnet]]s burned through, destroying the device.\n\n==== Efforts to restart funding ====\n\nWith no more funding during 2006, the project was stalled. This ended the US Navy's [[Robert Bussard#Appeal for funding|11-year embargo on publication and publicizing]] between 1994 and 2005.<ref>There is this clause in the [https://www.neco.navy.mil/upload/N68936/N6893609R0024RFP.pdf \"Solicitation, Offer and Award\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722210109/https://www.neco.navy.mil/upload/N68936/N6893609R0024RFP.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }} for the \"plasma wiffleball development project\", [https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=754cf58a3fd1b02abfe8521ff4f488a7&tab=core&_cview=1&cck=1&au=&ck= awarded] on March 3, 2009, to Matter Conversion Corporation:\n<blockquote>\n5252.204-9504 DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACT INFORMATION (NAVAIR) (JAN 2007)\n(a) The Contractor shall not release to anyone outside the Contractor's organization any unclassified information (e.g., announcement of contract award), regardless of medium (e.g., film, tape, document), pertaining to any part of this contract or any program related to this contract, unless the Contracting Officer has given prior written approval.\n(b) Requests for approval shall identify the specific information to be released, the medium to be used, and the purpose for the release.

Bussard had plans for WB-8 that was a higher-order polyhedron, with 12 electromagnets. However, this design was not used in the actual WB-8 machine.\n\nBussard believed that the WB-6 machine had demonstrated progress and that no intermediate-scale models would be needed. He noted, \"We are probably the only people on the planet who know how to make a real net power clean fusion system\"<ref name=\"fusor.net\"/> He proposed to rebuild WB-6 more robustly to verify its performance. After publishing the results, he planned to convene a conference of experts in the field in an attempt to get them behind his design. The first step in that plan was to design and build two more small scale designs (WB-7 and WB-8) to determine which full scale machine would be best. He wrote \"The only small scale machine work remaining, which can yet give further improvements in performance, is test of one or two WB-6-scale devices but with \"square\" or polygonal coils aligned approximately (but slightly offset on the main faces) along the edges of the vertices of the polyhedron. If this is built around a [[truncated dodecahedron]], near-optimum performance is expected; about 3\u20135 times better than WB-6.\"<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/> Bussard died on October 6, 2007 from [[multiple myeloma]] at age 79.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Dr. Robert W.

This left a mystery; both their machine and previous experiments showed clear and consistent evidence of the formation of a [[potential well]] that was trapping ions, which was previously ascribed to the formation of the electrodes. Exploring this problem, Bowden-Reid developed new field equations for the device that explained the potential well without electrode formation, and demonstrated that this matched both their results and those of previous experiments.<ref name=bowden/>\n\nFurther, exploring the overall mechanism of the virtual electrode concept demonstrated that its interactions with the ions and itself would make \"leak\" at a furious rate. Assuming plasma densities and energies required for net energy production, it was calculated that new electrons would have to be supplied at a rate of 200,000&nbsp;[[Ampere|Amps]]. This is essentially unfeasible.<ref name=bowden/>\n\nThe paper sums up the results this way:\n\n{{quote|Initial results indicate negligible charge trapping with little to no potential well formation. Further, it is shown that the existence of potential wells reported in previous publications can be explained without the requirement of a virtual cathode produced by trapped electrons. Moreover, it is shown that potential wells, which produce electron con\ufb01nement and heating from virtual cathodes, no longer exist with increasing plasma density.<ref name=bowden/>}}\n\nThe results were so convincing that it has been described as a \"final nail in the coffin for polywells.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/fusion/comments/dmqgd5/is_the_polywell_fusion_approach_still_under/ |title=Is the polywell fusion approach still under active development anywhere? |quote=I spoke to Joe Khachan (head of the USyd lab) about the results and he described the results as a \"final nail in the coffin for polywells.}}</ref>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Prometheus Fusion Perfection===\nMark Suppes built a polywell in Brooklyn.

It ran from 2015 to 2017. They developed a magneto-electrostatic reactor named \"F1\" that was based in-part on the polywell. It introduced a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces to provide a means of preserving energy and particle losses that would otherwise be lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremsstrahlung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis. Version 1 of the analytical model was developed by Senior Theoretical Physicist Dr Vladimir Mirnov and demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. These preliminary results were presented at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=site-page/alpha-2017-annual-review-meeting|title=ALPHA 2017 ANNUAL REVIEW MEETING|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  Phase 2 of the model removed key assumptions in the Rider analysis by incorporating a self-consistent treatment of the ion energy distribution (Rider assumed a purely Maxwellian distribution) and the power required to maintain the distribution and ion population. The results yielded an energy distribution that was non-thermal but more Maxwellian than monoenergetic. The input power required to maintain the distribution was calculated to be excessive and ion-ion thermalization was a dominant loss channel. With these additions, a pathway to commercial electricity generation was no longer feasible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Nuclear technology|Energy|Physics}}\n* [[Dense plasma focus]]\n* [[Fusion power#History of research|Fusion power \u00a7 History of research]]\n* [[George H.

It is closely related to the [[fusor]], the [[high beta fusion reactor]], the [[magnetic mirror]], and the [[biconic cusp]]. A set of [[electromagnets]] generates a magnetic field that traps [[electrons]]. This creates a negative voltage, which attracts positive [[ions]]. As the ions accelerate towards the negative center, their [[kinetic energy]] rises. Ions that collide at high enough energies can [[nuclear fusion|fuse]].\n\nThe polywell is one of many devices that use an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Miley | first1=George H. | last2=Murali | first2=S.

The outer cage has a positive [[voltage]] versus the inner cage. A fuel, typically, [[deuterium]] gas, is injected into this chamber. It is heated past its [[Ionization energy|ionization temperature]], making positive [[ion]]<nowiki/>s. The ions are positive and move towards the negative inner cage. Those that miss the wires of the inner cage fly through the center of the device at high speeds and can fly out the other side of the inner cage. As the ions move outward, a [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]] impels them back towards the center. Over time, a core of ionized gas can form inside the inner cage. Ions pass back and forth through the core until they strike either the grid or another nucleus. Most nucleus strikes do not result in fusion. Grid strikes can raise the temperature of the grid as well as eroding it. These strikes [[Thermal conduction|conduct]] mass and energy away from the plasma, as well as spall off metal ions into the gas, which cools it.\n\nIn fusors, the [[potential well]] is made with a wire cage. Because most of the ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]] losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even.\n\n[[File:Fusor Mechanism.png|thumb|center|400px|'''Figure 1''': Illustration of the basic mechanism of fusion in fusors. (1) The fusor contains two concentric wire cages. The cathode (blue) is inside the anode (red). (2) Positive ions are attracted to the inner cathode.

The null point is marked in red in the center.]]\n\nMagnetic fields exert a pressure on the plasma. Beta is the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic field strength. It can be defined separately for electrons and ions. The polywell concerns itself only for the electron beta, whereas the ion beta is of greater interest within Tokamak and other neutral-plasma machines. The two vary by a very large ratio, because of the enormous difference in mass between an electron and any ion. Typically in other devices the electron beta is neglected, as the ion beta determines more important plasma parameters. This is a significant point of confusion for scientists more familiar with more 'conventional' fusion plasma physics.\n\nNote that for the electron beta, only the electron number density and temperature are used, as both of these, but especially the latter, can vary significantly from the ion parameters at the same location.\n\n<math>\\beta_e = \\frac{p}{p_{mag}} = \\frac{n_e k_B T_e}{(B^2/2\\mu_0)}</math><ref>Wesson, J: \"Tokamaks\", 3rd edition page 115, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>\n\nMost experiments on polywells involve [[Beta (plasma physics)|low-beta plasma]] regimes (where ''\u03b2'' < 1),<ref name=\"Low beta confinement in a Polywell modeled with conventional point cusp theories\" /> where the plasma [[pressure]] is weak compared to the [[magnetic pressure]].

Bussard later called this type of confinement the ''Wiffle-Ball''. This analogy was used to describe electron trapping inside the field. Marbles can be trapped inside a [[Wiffle ball]], a hollow, perforated sphere; if marbles are put inside, they can roll and sometimes escape through the holes in the sphere. The magnetic topology of a high-beta polywell acts similarly with electrons.\n\n{{wide image|Proposed Mechainism for Wiffle Ball Confinement.png|700px|This figure shows the development of the proposed \u201cwiffle ball\u201d confinement concept.

Sharply bent fields were used by [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in a series of magnetic mirror machines from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. After hundreds of millions were spent, the machines still leaked plasma at the field ends. Many scientists shifted focus onto looping the fields, into a [[tokamak]]. Eventually it was thought that cusped confinement effect did not exist.\n\nIn June 2014 EMC2 published a preprint<ref name=\"Park 2014\" /> providing evidence that the effect is real, based on x-ray measurements and magnetic flux measurements during its experiment.\n\nAccording to Bussard, typical cusp leakage rate is such that an electron makes 5 to 8 passes before escaping through a cusp in a standard mirror confinement biconic cusp; 10 to 60 passes in a polywell under mirror confinement (low beta) that he called cusp confinement; and several thousand passes in Wiffle-Ball confinement (high beta).<ref name=\"EMC2-0191-02\">{{cite techreport |last1=Bussard |first1=Robert W. |last2=Krall |first2=Nicholas A. |title=Electron Leakage Through Magnetic Cusps in the Polywell Confinement Geometry |number=EMC2-0191-02 |institution=EMC2-DARPA |date=February 1991 |url=http://www.askmar.com/Fusion_files/EMC2%20Reports%20Reformatted/EMC2-0191-02%20Electron%20Leakage.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"IAC2006\" />\n\nIn February 2013, [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]] announced a new compact fusion machine, the [[high beta fusion reactor]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400 | title=Lockheed Martin announces compact Fusion Reactor plans |website=FuseNet | date=17 April 2013 | author=M.

The radius of this motion is the [[gyroradius]]. As it moves it loses some energy as [[Bremsstrahlung|x-rays]], every time it changes speed. The electron spins faster and tighter in denser fields, as it enters the MaGrid.

The energy distribution both drives and is driven by several physical rates,<ref name = \"Rider95Paper\"/> the electron and ion loss rate, the rate of energy loss by [[radiation]], the fusion rate and the rate of non-fusion collisions. The collision rate may vary greatly across the system:{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n* At the edge: where ions are slow and the electrons are fast.\n* At the center: where ions are fast and electrons are slow.\n\nCritics claimed that both the electrons and ion populations have [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|bell curve]] distribution;<ref name = \"Rider95Paper\"/> that the plasma is [[Plasma (physics)#Thermal vs. non-thermal plasmas|thermalized]].

All [[chemical element]]s can be fused; for elements with fewer protons than iron, this process changes [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|mass into energy]] that can potentially be captured to provide [[fusion power]].\n\nThe [[probability]] of a fusion reaction occurring is controlled by the [[cross section (physics)|cross section]] of the fuel,<ref>\"Development of the indirect drive approach to inertial confinement fusion and the target physics basis for ignition and gain\" John Lindl, Physics of Plasma, 1995</ref> which is in turn a function of its temperature. The easiest nuclei to fuse are [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. Their fusion occurs when the ions reach 4 keV ([[kiloelectronvolt]]s), or about 45 million [[kelvin]]s. The Polywell would achieve this by accelerating an ion with a charge of [[Elementary charge|1]] down a 4,000 volt electric field. The high cost, short [[half-life]] and [[radioactive|radioactivity]] of [[tritium]] make it difficult to work with.\n\nThe second easiest reaction is to fuse [[deuterium]] with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium is commonly used by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a fast neutron, and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse [[boron|boron-11]] with protons; this reaction is [[Aneutronic fusion|aneutronic]] (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-<sup>11</sup>B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using [[direct energy conversion]]. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency<ref>\u201cExperimental Results from a beam direct converter at 100 kV\u201d journal of fusion energy, Volume 2, Number 2, (1982) by R. W.

To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly enough to make up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through [[Thermal conduction|conduction]] and [[radiation]].<ref name = \"Lawson\"/> Conduction is when [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s or [[neutral particle|neutrals]] touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.\n\n'''Net Power = Efficiency &times; (Fusion &minus; Radiation Loss &minus; Conduction Loss)'''\n\n* Net Power \u2014 power output\n* Efficiency \u2014 fraction of energy needed to drive the device and convert it to electricity.\n* Fusion \u2014 energy generated by the fusion reactions.\n* Radiation \u2014 energy lost as light, leaving the plasma.\n* Conduction \u2014 energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma.\n\nLawson used this equation to estimate conditions for net power<ref name=\"Lawson\" /> based on a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwellian]] cloud.<ref name=\"Lawson\" />\n\nHowever, the Lawson criterion does not apply for Polywells if Bussard's conjecture that the plasma is nonthermal is correct. [[John D. Lawson (scientist)|Lawson]] stated in his founding report:<ref name=\"Lawson\" /> \"It is of course easy to postulate systems in which the velocity distribution of the particle is not Maxwellian. These systems are outside the scope of this report.\" He also ruled out the possibility of a nonthermal plasma to ignite: ''\"Nothing may be gained by using a system in which electrons are at a lower temperature [than ions]. The energy loss in such a system by transfer to the electrons will always be greater than the energy which would be radiated by the electrons if they were the [same] temperature.\"''\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nTodd Rider<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ll.mit.edu/60thAnniversary/rider.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314223354/http://www.ll.mit.edu/60thAnniversary/rider.html |archive-date=2017-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> calculated that [[bremsstrahlung|X-ray radiation]] losses with this fuel would exceed fusion power production by at least 20%.

He also stated that the density would scale with the square of the field (constant [[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] conditions), and the maximum attainable magnetic field would scale with the radius. Under those conditions, the fusion power produced would scale with [[Power law|the seventh power of]] the radius, and the energy gain would scale with the fifth power. While Bussard did not publicly document the reasoning underlying this estimate,<ref>\nPossibly he assumed that the ion energy distribution is fixed, that the magnetic field scales with the linear size, and that the ion pressure (proportional to density) scales with the [[magnetic pressure]] (proportional to ''B''\u00b2). The ''R''<sup>7</sup> scaling results from multiplying the fusion power density (proportional to density squared, or ''B''<sup>4</sup>) with the volume (proportional to''R''\u00b3). On the other hand, if it is important to maintain the ratio of the [[Debye length]] or the [[gyroradius]] to the machine size, then the magnetic field strength would have to scale ''inversely'' with the radius, so that the total power output would actually be lower in a larger machine.</ref> if true, it would enable a model only ten times larger to be useful as a fusion power plant.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/>\n\n==== WB-6 ====\n\nFunding became tighter and tighter. According to [[Bussard]], \"The funds were clearly needed for the more important [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|War in Iraq]].\"<ref name=\"randi\"/> An extra $900k of [[Office of Naval Research]] funding allowed the program to continue long enough to reach WB-6 testing in November 2005. WB-6 had rings with circular cross sections that space apart at the joints. This reduced the metal surface area unprotected by magnetic fields. These changes dramatically improved system performance, leading to more electron recirculation and better electron confinement, in a progressively tighter core. This machine produced a fusion rate of 10<sup>9</sup> per second. This is based on a total of nine neutrons in five tests, giving a wide confidence interval.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/><ref name=\"lab_notes\"/> Drive voltage on the WB-6 tests was about 12.5 kV, with a resulting potential well depth of about 10 kV.<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/> Thus deuterium ions could have a maximum of 10 keV of kinetic energy in the center. By comparison, a [[Fusor]] running deuterium fusion at 10 kV would produce a fusion rate almost too small to detect. [[Robert L. Hirsch|Hirsch]] reported a fusion rate this high only by driving his machine with a 150 kV drop between the inside and outside cages.<ref>Robert L. Hirsch, \"Inertial-Electrostatic Confinement of Ionized Fusion Gases\", Journal of Applied Physics, v. 38, no. 7, October 1967</ref> Hirsch also used [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]], a much easier fuel to fuse, because it has a higher [[nuclear cross section]].\n\nWhile the WB-6 pulses were sub-millisecond, Bussard felt the physics should represent steady state. A last-minute test of WB-6 ended prematurely when the insulation on one of the hand-wound [[electromagnet]]s burned through, destroying the device.\n\n==== Efforts to restart funding ====\n\nWith no more funding during 2006, the project was stalled.

Bussard had plans for WB-8 that was a higher-order polyhedron, with 12 electromagnets. However, this design was not used in the actual WB-8 machine.\n\nBussard believed that the WB-6 machine had demonstrated progress and that no intermediate-scale models would be needed. He noted, \"We are probably the only people on the planet who know how to make a real net power clean fusion system\"<ref name=\"fusor.net\"/> He proposed to rebuild WB-6 more robustly to verify its performance. After publishing the results, he planned to convene a conference of experts in the field in an attempt to get them behind his design. The first step in that plan was to design and build two more small scale designs (WB-7 and WB-8) to determine which full scale machine would be best. He wrote \"The only small scale machine work remaining, which can yet give further improvements in performance, is test of one or two WB-6-scale devices but with \"square\" or polygonal coils aligned approximately (but slightly offset on the main faces) along the edges of the vertices of the polyhedron. If this is built around a [[truncated dodecahedron]], near-optimum performance is expected; about 3\u20135 times better than WB-6.\"<ref name=\"IAC2006\"/> Bussard died on October 6, 2007 from [[multiple myeloma]] at age 79.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Dr. Robert W.

This left a mystery; both their machine and previous experiments showed clear and consistent evidence of the formation of a [[potential well]] that was trapping ions, which was previously ascribed to the formation of the electrodes. Exploring this problem, Bowden-Reid developed new field equations for the device that explained the potential well without electrode formation, and demonstrated that this matched both their results and those of previous experiments.<ref name=bowden/>\n\nFurther, exploring the overall mechanism of the virtual electrode concept demonstrated that its interactions with the ions and itself would make \"leak\" at a furious rate. Assuming plasma densities and energies required for net energy production, it was calculated that new electrons would have to be supplied at a rate of 200,000&nbsp;[[Ampere|Amps]]. This is essentially unfeasible.<ref name=bowden/>\n\nThe paper sums up the results this way:\n\n{{quote|Initial results indicate negligible charge trapping with little to no potential well formation. Further, it is shown that the existence of potential wells reported in previous publications can be explained without the requirement of a virtual cathode produced by trapped electrons.

It ran from 2015 to 2017. They developed a magneto-electrostatic reactor named \"F1\" that was based in-part on the polywell. It introduced a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces to provide a means of preserving energy and particle losses that would otherwise be lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremsstrahlung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis. Version 1 of the analytical model was developed by Senior Theoretical Physicist Dr Vladimir Mirnov and demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. These preliminary results were presented at the ARPA-E ALPHA 2017 Annual Review Meeting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=site-page/alpha-2017-annual-review-meeting|title=ALPHA 2017 ANNUAL REVIEW MEETING|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  Phase 2 of the model removed key assumptions in the Rider analysis by incorporating a self-consistent treatment of the ion energy distribution (Rider assumed a purely Maxwellian distribution) and the power required to maintain the distribution and ion population. The results yielded an energy distribution that was non-thermal but more Maxwellian than monoenergetic. The input power required to maintain the distribution was calculated to be excessive and ion-ion thermalization was a dominant loss channel. With these additions, a pathway to commercial electricity generation was no longer feasible.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Nuclear technology|Energy|Physics}}\n* [[Dense plasma focus]]\n* [[Fusion power#History of research|Fusion power \u00a7 History of research]]\n* [[George H.

It was based on the earlier [[Microsoft QuickBASIC compiler|QuickBASIC]] 4.5 compiler but without QuickBASIC's compiler and linker elements. Version 1.0 was shipped together with [[MS-DOS]] 5.0 and higher, as well as [[Windows 95]], [[Windows NT 3.1|Windows NT 3.x]], and [[Windows NT 4.0]]. [[IBM]] recompiled QBasic and included it in [[PC DOS]] 5.x, as well as [[OS/2]] 2.0 onwards.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/msbasv.htm#qbasic|title=Microsoft BASIC version information|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> [[eComStation]], descended from OS/2 code, includes QBasic 1.0 . QBasic 1.1 is included with MS-DOS 6.x, and, without <code>EDIT</code>, in [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows Me]]. Starting with [[Windows 2000]], Microsoft no longer includes QBasic with their operating systems,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258265|title=QBasic Missing from Windows 2000|date=2007-03-01|accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref> but can still be obtained for use on newer versions of Windows.\n\nQBasic (as well as the built-in [[MS-DOS Editor]]) is backwards-compatible with DOS releases prior to 5.0 (down to at least DOS 3.20). However, if used on any [[Intel 8088|8088]]/[[Intel 8086|8086]] computers, or on some [[Intel 80286|80286]] computers, the QBasic program may run very slowly, or perhaps not at all, due to DOS memory size limits. Until MS-DOS 7, MS-DOS Editor and Help required QBasic: the <code>EDIT.COM</code> and <code>HELP.COM</code> programs simply started QBasic in editor and help mode only, and these can also be entered by running <code>QBASIC.EXE</code> with the <code>/EDITOR</code> and <code>/QHELP</code> switches (i.e., command lines <code>QBASIC /EDITOR</code> and <code>QBASIC /QHELP</code>).\n\n== Advantages and Disadvantages ==\nSome of the advantages of QBasic are:\n\n* QBASIC is very easy-to-learn programming language.\n* QBASIC is free to download and it comes pre-installed in Windows 95/98.\n* Suitable for mathematical and business applications.\n* Best for beginners to understand the programming language.\n* It checks for errors in syntax automatically.\n* It is simple and easy to debug.\n\nAnd some of the disadvantages of QBasic are:\n\n* QBASIC is not a well-structured programming language.\n* It is mostly used in education or training.\n* QBasic cannot generate executable codes.\n* It is not a professional language.\n\n==Examples==\nQBasic came complete with four pre-written example programs. These were \"[[Nibbles (computer game)|Nibbles]]\", a variant of the [[Snake (video game)|Snake]] game; \"[[Gorillas (computer game)|Gorillas]]\", an [[Artillery game]]; \"[[Microsoft Money|MONEY MANAGER]]\", a personal finance manager; and \"RemLine\", a  Q-BASIC code line-number-removing program.<ref name=\"GBvsQB\"/>\n\n==Easter egg==\nQBasic has an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]].
