For example, in cloud based architecture, data is replicated and moved frequently so the risk of unauthorized data recovery increases dramatically. Such as in the case of disposal of old equipment, reuse of drives, reallocation of storage space. The manner that data is replicated depends on the service level a customer chooses and on the service provided.  When encryption is in place it can ensure confidentiality. [[Crypto-shredding]] can be used when disposing of data (on a [[Disk encryption|disk]]).\n# The number of people with access to the data who could be compromised (e.g., bribed, or coerced) increases dramatically.  A single company might have a small team of administrators, network engineers, and technicians, but a cloud storage company will have many customers and thousands of servers, therefore a much larger team of technical staff with physical and electronic access to almost all of the data at the entire facility or perhaps the entire company.<ref>{{cite web|title=US-CERT ICS-TIP-12-146-01 Targeted Cyber Intrusion and Detection Mitigation Strategies|url=ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/pruggiero/Sample%20Re-remediated%20Documents/ICS-TIP-12-146-01%20-%20 Cyber%20 Intrusion%20 Mitigation%20 Strategies .pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Decryption keys that are kept by the service user, as opposed to the service provider, limit the access to data by service provider employees. As for sharing multiple data in the cloud with multiple users, a large number of keys has to be distributed to users via secure channels for decryption, also it has to be securely stored and managed by the users in their devices. Storing these keys requires rather expensive secure storage. To overcome that, key-aggregate cryptosystem<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Key-Aggregate Cryptosystem for Scalable Data Sharing in Cloud Storage|journal = IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1045-9219|pages = 468\u2013477|volume = 25|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TPDS.2013.112|first = Cheng-Kang|last = Chu|first2 = Sherman S.M.|last2 = Chow|first3 = Wen-Guey|last3 = Tzeng|first4 = Jianying|last4 = Zhou|first5 = Robert H.|last5 = Deng}}</ref> can be used.\n# It increases the number of networks over which the data travels.  Instead of just a local area network (LAN) or storage area network (SAN), data stored on a cloud requires a WAN (wide area network) to connect them both.\n# By sharing storage and networks with many other users/customers it is possible for other customers to access your data.  Sometimes because of erroneous actions, faulty equipment, a bug and sometimes because of criminal intent. This risk applies to all types of storage and not only cloud storage. The risk of having data read during transmission can be mitigated through encryption technology. Encryption in transit protects data as it is being transmitted to and from the cloud service.<ref>[https://www.multcloud.com/tutorials/transfer-files-from-one-onedrive-account-to-another.html Transfer files from one onedrive account to another].</ref> Encryption at rest protects data that is stored at the service provider. Encrypting data in an on-premises cloud service on-ramp system can provide both kinds of encryption protection.\n\n===Longevity===\n{{See also|Financial Analysis}}\n\nCompanies are not permanent and the services and products they provide can change.

One option is to use a private cloud instead of a public cloud (there are as well providers that offer private cloud storage). Another option is to ingest data in encrypted format where the key is hold within your on premise infrastructure. Access is often by use of cloud storage gateways that are on premise. Such gateways have options not only to encrypt and compress the data prior of transfer but as well mirror the storage across multiple cloud storage providers and remove the risk of a single providers shutdown. Gateways offer as well the option to cache data on a most recently used algorithm on premise.

For example, in cloud based architecture, data is replicated and moved frequently so the risk of unauthorized data recovery increases dramatically. Such as in the case of disposal of old equipment, reuse of drives, reallocation of storage space. The manner that data is replicated depends on the service level a customer chooses and on the service provided.  When encryption is in place it can ensure confidentiality. [[Crypto-shredding]] can be used when disposing of data (on a [[Disk encryption|disk]]).\n# The number of people with access to the data who could be compromised (e.g., bribed, or coerced) increases dramatically.  A single company might have a small team of administrators, network engineers, and technicians, but a cloud storage company will have many customers and thousands of servers, therefore a much larger team of technical staff with physical and electronic access to almost all of the data at the entire facility or perhaps the entire company.<ref>{{cite web|title=US-CERT ICS-TIP-12-146-01 Targeted Cyber Intrusion and Detection Mitigation Strategies|url=ftp://ftp.sei.cmu.edu/pub/pruggiero/Sample%20Re-remediated%20Documents/ICS-TIP-12-146-01%20-%20 Cyber%20 Intrusion%20 Mitigation%20 Strategies .pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Decryption keys that are kept by the service user, as opposed to the service provider, limit the access to data by service provider employees. As for sharing multiple data in the cloud with multiple users, a large number of keys has to be distributed to users via secure channels for decryption, also it has to be securely stored and managed by the users in their devices. Storing these keys requires rather expensive secure storage. To overcome that, key-aggregate cryptosystem<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Key-Aggregate Cryptosystem for Scalable Data Sharing in Cloud Storage|journal = IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1045-9219|pages = 468\u2013477|volume = 25|issue = 2|doi = 10.1109/TPDS.2013.112|first = Cheng-Kang|last = Chu|first2 = Sherman S.M.|last2 = Chow|first3 = Wen-Guey|last3 = Tzeng|first4 = Jianying|last4 = Zhou|first5 = Robert H.|last5 = Deng}}</ref> can be used.\n# It increases the number of networks over which the data travels.  Instead of just a local area network (LAN) or storage area network (SAN), data stored on a cloud requires a WAN (wide area network) to connect them both.\n# By sharing storage and networks with many other users/customers it is possible for other customers to access your data.  Sometimes because of erroneous actions, faulty equipment, a bug and sometimes because of criminal intent. This risk applies to all types of storage and not only cloud storage. The risk of having data read during transmission can be mitigated through encryption technology. Encryption in transit protects data as it is being transmitted to and from the cloud service.<ref>[https://www.multcloud.com/tutorials/transfer-files-from-one-onedrive-account-to-another.html Transfer files from one onedrive account to another].</ref> Encryption at rest protects data that is stored at the service provider.

Such gateways have options not only to encrypt and compress the data prior of transfer but as well mirror the storage across multiple cloud storage providers and remove the risk of a single providers shutdown.

Colors may be specified as an [[RGB color model|RGB]] triplet or in [[hexadecimal]] format (a ''hex triplet'') or according to their common English names in some cases. A [[color tool]] or other [[graphics software]] is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading [[number sign]] (#).<ref>{{cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color }}</ref><ref>York, Richard. ''Beginning CSS'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref> A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by eight [[bit]]s. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the [[sRGB]] gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.\n\nColors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to [[scRGB]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |at=section 4.2.1.

[[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.\n\n==Hex triplet==\nA '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[24-bit color|24-bit RGB color scheme]]. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:\n*Byte 1: red value (color type red)\n*Byte 2: green value (color type green)\n*Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)\nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\n\nIf any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.\n\nThe number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16<sup>6</sup> or 256<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>24</sup> = 16,777,216.\n\n===Shorthand hexadecimal form===\nAn abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1.

This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.\n\nConversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.\n\n==HTML color names==\nThe [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 \"Colors\"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):\n{{Colornames}}\n\nThese 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were \"the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification \"The BODY element\" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\">\nList of common [https://www.nishatshagor.com/2020/04/CSS-color-in-HTML.html HTML Color codes] chart\n<tr>\n      <th class=\"color-swatch\" style=\"    padding: 15px 21px;\n    background: #f1f1f1;\n    width: 25%;\n    border: 2px solid #e4e3e3;\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot;

A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].\n\nThe list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe list of web \"X11 colors\" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below. Compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards. This includes the common synonyms: aqua (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and cyan (common sRGB name), magenta (common sRGB name) and fuchsia (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name), gray (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and grey.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#svg-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.3.

When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.\n\nThere were various attempts to make a \"standard\" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).\n\nThe list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&quot; - Why? Please clarify}}\n\n\"Web-safe\" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5\u00d75\u00d75 or 4\u00d74\u00d74) were allocated by browsers\u2014the \"web safe\" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> have 24-bit ([[24-bit color|TrueColor]]) and the use of \"web-safe\" colors has fallen into practical disuse.\n\nThe \"web-safe\" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 6 shades of each color\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Hex\n! scope=\"col\" | Decimal\n! scope=\"col\" | Fraction\n|-\n| 0\n| 00\n| 0\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0\n|-\n| 3\n| 33\n| 51\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.2\n|-\n| 6\n| 66\n| 102\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.4\n|-\n| 9\n| 99\n| 153\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.6\n|-\n| C or (12)\n| CC\n| 204\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.8\n|-\n| F or (15)\n| FF\n| 255\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1\n|}\n\nThe following table shows all of the \"web-safe\" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.\n\n===Color table===\n{{Web safe colors}}\n\n===Safest web colors===\nDesigners were encouraged to stick to these 216 \"web-safe\" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors \"the reallysafe palette\"; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; color:white; width:80%; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"color: black;\" | Safest web colors\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!\n!0\n!3\n!6\n!9\n!C\n!F\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |00\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #000;\" | *000*\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%;\" |\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F00;\" | *F00*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |03\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #003;\" | *003*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F03;\" | *F03*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |0F\n| style=\"background: #00F;\" | *00F*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #F0F;\" | *F0F*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F0\n| style=\"background: #0F0;\" | *0F0*\n|\n| style=\"background: #6F0;\" | *6F0*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FF0;\" | *FF0*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F3\n|\n| style=\"background: #3F3;\" | *3F3*\n| style=\"background: #6F3;\" | *6F3*\n|\n|\n| style=\" background: #FF3;\" | *FF3*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F6\n| style=\"background: #0F6;\" | *0F6*\n| style=\"background: #3F6;\" | *3F6*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #CF6;\" | *CF6*\n| style=\"background: #FF6;\" | *FF6*<ref>{{cite web|title = Web Color Reference - HTML with Style {{!}} 4 {{!}} WebReference|url = http://www.webreference.com/html/reference/color/websafe.html|website = www.webreference.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref>\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FC\n| style=\"background: #0FC;\" | *0FC*\n| style=\"background: #3FC;\" | *3FC*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FF\n| style=\"background: #0FF;\" | *0FF*\n| style=\"background: #3FF;\" | *3FF*\n| style=\"background: #6FF;\" | *6FF*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FFF;\" | *FFF*\n|}\n\n==CSS colors==\nThe [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}</ref> The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the \"HTML4 color keywords\" section, which was renamed as \"Basic color keywords\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 \u2013  Proposed Recommendation - 11.

A [[color tool]] or other [[graphics software]] is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading [[number sign]] (#).<ref>{{cite book | last = Niederst Robbins | first = Jennifer | title = Web Design in a Nutshell | publisher = O'Reilly |date=February 2006 |page=830 | isbn = 978-0-596-00987-8 |chapter=Appendix D: Specifying Color }}</ref><ref>York, Richard.

[[User agent]]s vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for [[Web-to-print]] applications.\n\n==Hex triplet==\nA '''hex triplet''' is a six-digit, three-[[byte]] [[hexadecimal]] number used in [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the [[24-bit color|24-bit RGB color scheme]]. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:\n*Byte 1: red value (color type red)\n*Byte 2: green value (color type green)\n*Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)\nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a grayish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\n\nIf any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.\n\nThe number of colors that can be represented by this system is 16<sup>6</sup> or 256<sup>3</sup> or 2<sup>24</sup> = 16,777,216.\n\n===Shorthand hexadecimal form===\nAn abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit form is used.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#rgb-color |publisher=W3C |work=CSS Color Module Level 3 |title=4.2.1.

This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See [[hexadecimal]] for more details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.\n\nConversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern [[operating system]]s. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.\n\n==HTML color names==\nThe [[HTML]] 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, defines 16 named colors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=HTML 4.01 Specification section 6.5 \"Colors\"|date=|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):\n{{Colornames}}\n\nThese 16 were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were \"the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] palette.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html32#body |title=HTML 3.2 Specification \"The BODY element\" |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==X11 color names==\n[[File:SVG Recognized color keyword names.svg|thumbnail|SVG Version of X11 color names]]\n{{main|X11 color names}}\nA number of colors are defined by [[web browser]]s. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of [[X11 color names]] distributed with the [[X Window System]]. These colors were standardized by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG 1.0]], and are accepted by [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Full]] user agents. They are not part of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]].\n\nThe list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple [[RGB color model|RGB]] (hence, no particular color space), rather than [[sRGB]]. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=//lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-svg/2002Apr/0052.html |title=Public discussion on SVG mailing list ''Re: color names in SVG-1.0 conflict with /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt'' |publisher=Lists.w3.org |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe list of web \"X11 colors\" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below.

When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not one available, a different one had to be used. This can be done by either using the closest color, or by using [[dither]]ing.\n\nThere were various attempts to make a \"standard\" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).\n\nThe list of colors is presented as if it had special properties that render them immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications can actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they choose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=Another editor left a comment stating, &quot;not really, it was pretty much a disaster&quot; - Why? Please clarify}}\n\n\"Web-safe\" colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as [[X Window System|X11]] where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5\u00d75\u00d75 or 4\u00d74\u00d74) were allocated by browsers\u2014the \"web safe\" colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to [[Color quantization|quantize]] the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, personal computers typically<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp |title=Browser Display Statistics |publisher=W3schools.com |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref> have 24-bit ([[24-bit color|TrueColor]]) and the use of \"web-safe\" colors has fallen into practical disuse.\n\nThe \"web-safe\" colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an [[RGB]] triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ 6 shades of each color\n! scope=\"col\" | Key\n! scope=\"col\" | Hex\n! scope=\"col\" | Decimal\n! scope=\"col\" | Fraction\n|-\n| 0\n| 00\n| 0\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0\n|-\n| 3\n| 33\n| 51\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.2\n|-\n| 6\n| 66\n| 102\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.4\n|-\n| 9\n| 99\n| 153\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.6\n|-\n| C or (12)\n| CC\n| 204\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 0.8\n|-\n| F or (15)\n| FF\n| 255\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1\n|}\n\nThe following table shows all of the \"web-safe\" colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish.\n\n===Color table===\n{{Web safe colors}}\n\n===Safest web colors===\nDesigners were encouraged to stick to these 216 \"web-safe\" colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on [[highcolour|16-bit computer displays]]. They called these 22 colors \"the reallysafe palette\"; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and blue, as can be seen in the table below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~wilkins/color/websafecolors.html |title=Death of the Websafe Color Palette? |publisher=Physics.ohio-state.edu |date= |accessdate=8 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%; color:white; width:80%; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|+ style=\"color: black;\" | Safest web colors\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!\n!0\n!3\n!6\n!9\n!C\n!F\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |00\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #000;\" | *000*\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%;\" |\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F00;\" | *F00*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |03\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #003;\" | *003*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"width:16%; background: #F03;\" | *F03*\n|-\n! style=\"color:black\" |0F\n| style=\"background: #00F;\" | *00F*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #F0F;\" | *F0F*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F0\n| style=\"background: #0F0;\" | *0F0*\n|\n| style=\"background: #6F0;\" | *6F0*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FF0;\" | *FF0*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F3\n|\n| style=\"background: #3F3;\" | *3F3*\n| style=\"background: #6F3;\" | *6F3*\n|\n|\n| style=\" background: #FF3;\" | *FF3*\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!F6\n| style=\"background: #0F6;\" | *0F6*\n| style=\"background: #3F6;\" | *3F6*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #CF6;\" | *CF6*\n| style=\"background: #FF6;\" | *FF6*<ref>{{cite web|title = Web Color Reference - HTML with Style {{!}} 4 {{!}} WebReference|url = http://www.webreference.com/html/reference/color/websafe.html|website = www.webreference.com|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref>\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FC\n| style=\"background: #0FC;\" | *0FC*\n| style=\"background: #3FC;\" | *3FC*\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"color: black;\"\n!FF\n| style=\"background: #0FF;\" | *0FF*\n| style=\"background: #3FF;\" | *3FF*\n| style=\"background: #6FF;\" | *6FF*\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #FFF;\" | *FFF*\n|}\n\n==CSS colors==\nThe [[Cascading Style Sheets]] specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 [[#HTML color names|html colors]], and 124 colors from the Netscape [[#X11 color names|X11 color]] list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cng.seas.rochester.edu/CNG/docs/x11color.html |title=The X11 Color Set |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref> Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape's expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/color/colors.htm |title=Colors in HTML and CSS |author=Brian Wilson |accessdate=6 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn CSS 2.1, the color 'orange' (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#color-units |title=CSS 2.1 Specification: Syntax and basic data types: Colors |date=8 September 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2009 }}</ref> The CSS3.0 specification did not include ''orange'' in the \"HTML4 color keywords\" section, which was renamed as \"Basic color keywords\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/PR-css3-color-20101028/#changes |title=CSS Color Module Level 3 \u2013  Proposed Recommendation - 11.

Kapitulna]]\n[[File:Kielce, Ulica Sienkiewicza noc\u0105.jpg|thumb|The intersection of Sienkiewicza and Paderewskiego photograhped at night]]\n'''Henryk Sienkiewicz Street in [[Kielce]]''' ({{lang-pl|ulica Henryka Sienkiewicza}}) is  the main commercial and historic \"[[Arterial road|artery]]\" of the city of [[Kielce]], [[Poland]]. It was built in the middle of the 19th century. It was originally called ''ulica Konstantego'' ('''Constantine Street'''), then '''Postal Street''' and in 1919 it received its present name. Shops and department stores are located there as well as historic buildings and monuments. It is approximately 1270 meters long and runs from the [[railway station]] situated next to the Independence square to the [[Moniuszko Square, Kielce|Moniuszko Square]].\n\n==History==\nThe early street began at the end of the 17th century. At that time, Kielce had about 1500 permanent inhabitants. In 1789 there were only six brick houses \u2013 four of them were situated right by the main square and the other two on Ma\u0142a street. The city had 252 houses then. The coming Sienkiewicza street ran between the \u201cbishops\u2019 town\u201d and the residences of citizens. It wasn\u2019t covered with any paving, as a result mud was an everyday occurrence there. In the easterly direction, the road disappeared in fields, while it led to the swampy bank of the [[Silnica River]] to the west.\n\nIn 1821 [[Marian Potocki]], an official land surveyor of the [[Congress Poland|Polish Kingdom]], created a spatial planning of Kielce. The plan considered in its conception the leading role of Kielce as an administrative, educational and service center. The city attempted to become modernized without radical redevelopment of the downtown by the growth of areas of settlement, and adjustment of currently existing streets while building new ones. According to Potocki\u2019s plan, Sienkiewicza street had its beginning next to the Leonarda square, while the other end led to nowhere. It didn\u2019t end at the designed square at the junction of Le\u015bna and Kapitulna streets but it went all the way to Silnica and continued onwards in a westerly direction. Probably, the plan was to merge Sienkiewicza with the centre of mining and ferrous metallurgy. (Czarn\u00f3w, [[G\u00f3rki Szczukowskie]], [[Karcz\u00f3wka, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Karcz\u00f3wka]])\n\nIn 1823, the present Sienkiewicz Street, on the initiative of Marian Potocki, was named Constantine Street  after the [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]], the chief executive officer of the Polish Kingdom army. He was the most important personage in the Polish Kingdom and in fact (after the death of general [[J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek]]) also the tsarist governor. Konstanty street was cobbled in order to enable water transport in case of fire and quicker and also because it led to government offices (mortgagees, post offices and school).

It was built in the middle of the 19th century. It was originally called ''ulica Konstantego'' ('''Constantine Street'''), then '''Postal Street''' and in 1919 it received its present name. Shops and department stores are located there as well as historic buildings and monuments. It is approximately 1270 meters long and runs from the [[railway station]] situated next to the Independence square to the [[Moniuszko Square, Kielce|Moniuszko Square]].\n\n==History==\nThe early street began at the end of the 17th century. At that time, Kielce had about 1500 permanent inhabitants. In 1789 there were only six brick houses \u2013 four of them were situated right by the main square and the other two on Ma\u0142a street. The city had 252 houses then. The coming Sienkiewicza street ran between the \u201cbishops\u2019 town\u201d and the residences of citizens. It wasn\u2019t covered with any paving, as a result mud was an everyday occurrence there. In the easterly direction, the road disappeared in fields, while it led to the swampy bank of the [[Silnica River]] to the west.\n\nIn 1821 [[Marian Potocki]], an official land surveyor of the [[Congress Poland|Polish Kingdom]], created a spatial planning of Kielce. The plan considered in its conception the leading role of Kielce as an administrative, educational and service center. The city attempted to become modernized without radical redevelopment of the downtown by the growth of areas of settlement, and adjustment of currently existing streets while building new ones. According to Potocki\u2019s plan, Sienkiewicza street had its beginning next to the Leonarda square, while the other end led to nowhere. It didn\u2019t end at the designed square at the junction of Le\u015bna and Kapitulna streets but it went all the way to Silnica and continued onwards in a westerly direction. Probably, the plan was to merge Sienkiewicza with the centre of mining and ferrous metallurgy. (Czarn\u00f3w, [[G\u00f3rki Szczukowskie]], [[Karcz\u00f3wka, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Karcz\u00f3wka]])\n\nIn 1823, the present Sienkiewicz Street, on the initiative of Marian Potocki, was named Constantine Street  after the [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]], the chief executive officer of the Polish Kingdom army. He was the most important personage in the Polish Kingdom and in fact (after the death of general [[J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek]]) also the tsarist governor. Konstanty street was cobbled in order to enable water transport in case of fire and quicker and also because it led to government offices (mortgagees, post offices and school). It ended at the junction of Le\u015bna and Kapitulna Streets. \n\nAt that time the Silnica River wasn\u2019t bridged. In order to cross the river citizens had to ford it. After the outbreak of the [[November Uprising]] the Konstanty street began to be called Postal Street \u2013 after the building of a post office that was situated on it.

It begins in the very early Colonial period, and lasts until roughly the first decade of the Eighteenth century. In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341\u2013342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> Hijiya goes on to say that the lack of decoration may have reflected that they viewed death as simply as an \"ordinary, unremarkable aspect of the human condition\", absent from any notion of either oblivion or passing on to ethereal life.<ref name=\"h343\">Hijiya (1983), p. 343</ref>\n\n===Death's head===\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\nThe death's head is the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in colonial era American headstones. Typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was then less about inspiring dread in the viewer, and more about acknowledging an normal, everyday fact of human life. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but over time, evolved towards glorification of the soul. \n\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Skull and cross-bones, gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike.\n\nExtra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Cherubs===\n[[File:The Burying Point, Salem (493768) (11362885626) Crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Cherub, 1777. The Burying Point, Salem, MA]]\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, cherubs (or \"soul effigies\") comprise skull-like representations of the soul<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" /> The practice of using cherubs rather than death's heads appears to have originated in the Boston area in the mid-18th century, and is more commonly found in southern rater than northern parts of New England.<ref name=\"d504\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 504</ref> Especially from late 18th century on, some of the cherubs have individualised faces, and may contain elements of portraiture. Headstones markig male raves tend to have hair shown with a downwards curl, while those marking female graves show an upwards curl.<ref name=\"d505\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 505</ref>\n\n===Later motifs===\n[[File:LoisWitham d1800 Rockport CROP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Urn and willow, on the gravestone of Lois Witham (d.1800). Old Burial Ground, Rockport MA]]\nThe imps of death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved [[imp]]s either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s and [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe inclusion of cherubs mostly dates from the mid 18th century have a direct lineage to earlier funerary art, in that they often show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\n===Epitaphs===\n[[Epitaph]]s become common from the later 17th century. From these, sit becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" /> They often take the format of bleak [[memento mori]]s:<ref name=\"d506\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 506</ref> \n\n{{quote|<poem>\nRemember me as you pass by\nAs you are now so once was I\nAs I am now you soon must be\nPrepare for death and follow me<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n \nThese early examples always reflected the pessimistic puritan outlook of the time, in that they do not mention an afterlife or the resurrection of the dead, and often include imagery of worms, decay and dust. It is only on the later cherub stones that more personalised goodbyes to loved ones, or mention of an afterlife begin to appear:<ref name=\"d506\" />\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFarewell my wife and children dear\nI leave you for a while\nFor God has called and I must go\nAnd leave you all behind.<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n\n==Study==\nSerious academic study of early puritan funerary art is a relatively new field. The historian and photographer [[Harriette Forbes]], working with the historian Ernest Caulfield in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study the subject and amassed the first significant library of photographs and an expansive catalog of 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli (1979/80), p.328</ref> Her book ''Gravestones of Early New England and the Men Who Made Them, 1653-1800'' classified and interpret the artifacts in the context of the dominant religious and cultural influences of their times.<ref name=\"m3\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 3</ref> The influential puritan minister, author, and pamphleteer [[Cotton Mather]] observed in 1693 how \"the stones in this wilderness are already grown so witty as to speak\".<ref name=\"m1\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 1</ref> However modern scholars take a more circumspect view, in that most of the early carvers were often armatures, and although they had basic understandings of iconography, their style and language evolved in a setting cut off from European trends, or a coherent, internal, written discourse. The historian Richard Meyer largely agrees with Mather's claim, and notes how the path of study of these early graveyards understood that such artifacts, \"through a variety of complex and often interrelated manifestations, establish patterns of communication (and even dynamic interaction) with those who use or view them\".<ref name=\"m1\" />\n\nThe next major publication was Allen Ludwig's 1966 book ''Graven Images: New England Stone Carving and its Symbols, 1650-1815'', although it tended to focus on describing specific examples, rather than present broad overviews or analysis.\n\nReflecting the density of surviving examples, in 2006, the art historian James Blachowicz produced a catalog of 8000 stones and 713 individual burial grounds.<ref name=\"w494\" /> He lists some 1300 stones that are signed or have been documented, and made a significant contribution to the methodology used to attribute headstones to individual carvers. In particular he identified 60 sets of [[typeface]]s, provided a detailed overview of how styles of representing letters, numbers and symbols could be used to group headstones by their carvers.<ref name=\"w495\">Wood (2008), p. 195</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane.

In most scholarly overviews, the amateurish carvings are attributed to a lack of tools and know-how on the part of the very early practitioners, who did have access to more experienced stonemasons. This explains in part why it remained in some areas later than others; with craftsmen in some areas developing their skills quicker than in others.<ref>Hijiya (1983), pp. 341\u2013342</ref> A further reason may be that the early puritans, due to their feelings on humility and lack of regard for adornments, deliberately kept their headstones simple and minimalist.<ref name=\"h342\" /> Hijiya goes on to say that the lack of decoration may have reflected that they viewed death as simply as an \"ordinary, unremarkable aspect of the human condition\", absent from any notion of either oblivion or passing on to ethereal life.<ref name=\"h343\">Hijiya (1983), p. 343</ref>\n\n===Death's head===\n[[File:Boston Puritan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|Winged death headstone in [[Granary Burying Ground]], Boston. 17th century]]\nThe death's head is the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in colonial era American headstones. Typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was then less about inspiring dread in the viewer, and more about acknowledging an normal, everyday fact of human life. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but over time, evolved towards glorification of the soul. \n\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3|Skull and cross-bones, gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike.\n\nExtra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Cherubs===\n[[File:The Burying Point, Salem (493768) (11362885626) Crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Cherub, 1777. The Burying Point, Salem, MA]]\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, cherubs (or \"soul effigies\") comprise skull-like representations of the soul<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" /> The practice of using cherubs rather than death's heads appears to have originated in the Boston area in the mid-18th century, and is more commonly found in southern rater than northern parts of New England.<ref name=\"d504\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 504</ref> Especially from late 18th century on, some of the cherubs have individualised faces, and may contain elements of portraiture. Headstones markig male raves tend to have hair shown with a downwards curl, while those marking female graves show an upwards curl.<ref name=\"d505\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 505</ref>\n\n===Later motifs===\n[[File:LoisWitham d1800 Rockport CROP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Urn and willow, on the gravestone of Lois Witham (d.1800). Old Burial Ground, Rockport MA]]\nThe imps of death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved [[imp]]s either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s and [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe inclusion of cherubs mostly dates from the mid 18th century have a direct lineage to earlier funerary art, in that they often show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 503</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\n===Epitaphs===\n[[Epitaph]]s become common from the later 17th century. From these, sit becomes possible to tell something of the attitudes and outlook of both the masons and the deceased.<ref name=\"d502\" /> They often take the format of bleak [[memento mori]]s:<ref name=\"d506\">Dethlefsen; Deetz (1966) p. 506</ref> \n\n{{quote|<poem>\nRemember me as you pass by\nAs you are now so once was I\nAs I am now you soon must be\nPrepare for death and follow me<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n \nThese early examples always reflected the pessimistic puritan outlook of the time, in that they do not mention an afterlife or the resurrection of the dead, and often include imagery of worms, decay and dust. It is only on the later cherub stones that more personalised goodbyes to loved ones, or mention of an afterlife begin to appear:<ref name=\"d506\" />\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nFarewell my wife and children dear\nI leave you for a while\nFor God has called and I must go\nAnd leave you all behind.<ref name=\"d506\" /></poem>}}\n\n==Study==\nSerious academic study of early puritan funerary art is a relatively new field. The historian and photographer [[Harriette Forbes]], working with the historian Ernest Caulfield in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study the subject and amassed the first significant library of photographs and an expansive catalog of 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli (1979/80), p.328</ref> Her book ''Gravestones of Early New England and the Men Who Made Them, 1653-1800'' classified and interpret the artifacts in the context of the dominant religious and cultural influences of their times.<ref name=\"m3\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 3</ref> The influential puritan minister, author, and pamphleteer [[Cotton Mather]] observed in 1693 how \"the stones in this wilderness are already grown so witty as to speak\".<ref name=\"m1\">Meyer (1989), chapter 1, p. 1</ref> However modern scholars take a more circumspect view, in that most of the early carvers were often armatures, and although they had basic understandings of iconography, their style and language evolved in a setting cut off from European trends, or a coherent, internal, written discourse. The historian Richard Meyer largely agrees with Mather's claim, and notes how the path of study of these early graveyards understood that such artifacts, \"through a variety of complex and often interrelated manifestations, establish patterns of communication (and even dynamic interaction) with those who use or view them\".<ref name=\"m1\" />\n\nThe next major publication was Allen Ludwig's 1966 book ''Graven Images: New England Stone Carving and its Symbols, 1650-1815'', although it tended to focus on describing specific examples, rather than present broad overviews or analysis.\n\nReflecting the density of surviving examples, in 2006, the art historian James Blachowicz produced a catalog of 8000 stones and 713 individual burial grounds.<ref name=\"w494\" /> He lists some 1300 stones that are signed or have been documented, and made a significant contribution to the methodology used to attribute headstones to individual carvers. In particular he identified 60 sets of [[typeface]]s, provided a detailed overview of how styles of representing letters, numbers and symbols could be used to group headstones by their carvers.<ref name=\"w495\">Wood (2008), p. 195</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane.
