She had bought a lot of new gowns on credit, believing in Repin's promise that he had a big shipment of opium coming in which would give them both plenty of money. Now those gowns had to be paid for and Cassie's chum, Molly Morton, taken out of the country before a growing taste for opium got a final hold on her. So Cassie bet on a sure thing in the races and lost. \"But I'm going to get you out, Kid,\" she told Molly, and as a last resort she went back to the game. Up in Hang Chow, a trouble-infested village near the poppy fields, she tried to trace the shipment Repin expected. A white man was there \u2014 supposed to be opening an abandoned mine. It was her business to find out if he was a government inspector seeking the den of the dope dealers. She posed as a novelist, and he, believing in her, told her that he was there to fight the dope menace. Cassie felt like a cheat of the lowest order and she turned against her comrades, but they, by trickery, found out what she had learned from the mine superintendent. In a flash they set the little world ablaze with rebellion and the soul of Cassie Cook was cleansed in the fires of remorse as she battled for what she believed was the right cause, and out of it came a love that was clean and honorable.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Priscilla Dean]] as Cassie Cook / Lucille Preston\n* [[Matt Moore (actor)|Matt Moore]] as Capt.

The latter was adapted as [[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|the 1962 film of the same name]] (directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], screenplay by [[John Fante]]).\n\n==Early life==\nAlgren was born '''Nelson Ahlgren Abraham''' in [[Detroit]], Michigan, the son of Goldie (n\u00e9e Kalisher) and Gerson Abraham.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonalgrenlife00drew_1 |url-access=registration |quote=goldie kalisher algren. |title=Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side |year=1989 |via=[[Internet Archive]] |author=Bettina Drew |publisher=Putnam |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref> At the age of three, he moved with his parents to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where they lived in a working-class, immigrant neighborhood on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]]. His father was the son of a [[Swedes|Swedish]] convert to [[Judaism]] and of a German Jewish woman, and his mother was of [[German Jews|German Jewish]] descent. (She owned a candy store on the South Side.) When he was young, Algren's family lived at 7139 S. South Park Avenue (now S. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) in the [[Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago|Greater Grand Crossing]] section of the South Side.<ref name=\"Biblio\" />\n\nWhen he was eight, his family moved from the far South Side to an apartment at 4834 N.

Before returning to Chicago, he was caught stealing a typewriter from an empty classroom at Sul Ross State University in Alpine. He boarded a train for his getaway but was apprehended and returned to Alpine. He was held in jail for nearly five months and faced a possible additional three years in prison. He was released, but the incident made a deep impression on him. It deepened his identification with outsiders, has-beens, and the general failures who later populated his fictional world.\n\nIn 1935 Algren won the first of his three [[O. Henry Awards]] for his short story, \"The Brother's House.\" The story was first published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine and was reprinted in an anthology of O. Henry Award winners.\n\n===Early books===\nHis first novel, ''[[Somebody in Boots]]'' (1935), was later dismissed by Algren as primitive and politically naive, claiming he infused it with [[Marxist]] ideas he little understood, because they were fashionable at the time. The book was unsuccessful and went out of print.\n\nHis second novel, ''Never Come Morning'' (1942), was described by [[Andrew O'Hagan]] in 2019 as \"the book that really shows the Algren style in its first great flourishing.\" It portrays the dead-end life of a doomed young [[Polish-American]] boxer turned criminal.<ref name=\"O'Hagan\">{{cite news|last=O'Hagan|first=Andrew|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/nelson-algren-singing-back-streets/|title=Singing the Back Streets|work=The New York Review of Books|date=November 7, 2019|access-date=October 21, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> [[Ernest Hemingway]], in a July 8, 1942, letter to his publisher [[Maxwell Perkins]], said of the novel: \"I think it very, very good. It is as fine and good stuff to come out of Chicago.\" The novel offended members of Chicago's large Polish-American community, some of whose members denounced it as pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] propaganda. Not knowing that Algren was of partly Jewish descent, some incensed Polish-American Chicagoans said he was pro-[[Nazi]] Nordic. His Polish-American critics persuaded Mayor [[Edward Joseph Kelly]] to ban the novel from the [[Chicago Public Library]].\n\nHis first short-story collection, ''[[The Neon Wilderness]]'' (1947), collected 24 stories from 1933 to 1947. The same year, Algren received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and a grant from Chicago's [[Newberry Library]].<ref>[[Google Books]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_neon_wilderness.html?id=bEBaAAAAMAAJ ''The Neon Wilderness'']: \"Algren received a 1947 Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a grant from Chicago's Newberry Library.\"</ref>\n\n===Highest profile===\nAlgren is best known for his novel ''[[The Man With the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man With the Golden Arm]]'' (1949), which won the [[National Book Award for Fiction]] in 1950.<ref name=nba1950>\n[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1950 \"National Book Awards \u2013 1950\"].

Frankie is trapped in [[demimonde]] Chicago, having picked up a [[morphine]] habit during his brief military service during [[World War II]]. He is married to a woman whom he mistakenly believes became crippled in a car accident he caused.\n\nAlgren's next book, ''[[Chicago, City on the Make]]'' (1951), was a scathing essay that outraged the city's boosters but portrayed the back alleys of the city, its dispossessed, its corrupt politicians and its swindlers. Algren also declared his love of the City as a \"lovely so real\".\n\n''The Man With the Golden Arm'' was adapted as a [[The Man With the Golden Arm|1955 movie]] of the same name, starring [[Frank Sinatra]] and directed and produced by [[Otto Preminger]]. Algren soon withdrew from direct involvement. It was a commercial success but Algren loathed the film.<ref name=\"O'Hagan\" /> He sued Preminger seeking an injunction to stop him from claiming ownership of the property as \"An Otto Preminger film\", but he soon withdrew his suit for financial reasons.<ref name=\"Fujiwara\">{{cite book|last=Fujiwara|first=Chris|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z-2-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA194|title=The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger|location=New York City|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2008|page=194}}</ref>\n\nAlgren had his last mainstream success with the novel ''[[A Walk on the Wild Side]]'' (1956). He reworked some of the material from his first novel, ''Somebody in Boots'', as well as picking up elements from several published short stories, such as his 1947 \"The Face on the Barroom Floor\".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The novel was about a wandering Texan adrift during the early years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He said it was superior to the earlier book. It was adapted as the [[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|1962 movie]] of the same name. Some critics thought the film [[bowdlerized]] the book, and it was not commercially successful.\n\nAlgren played a small part in [[Philip Kaufman]]'s underground comedy ''[[Fearless Frank]]'' (1967) as a mobster named Needles.\n\n===Legacy===\nAlgren articulated the world of \"drunks, pimps, prostitutes, freaks, drug addicts, prize fighters, corrupt politicians, and hoodlums\". [[Art Shay]] wrote, years later, about how Algren had written a poem from the perspective of a \"halfy\", street slang for a legless man on wheels.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/> The protagonist talks about \"how forty wheels rolled over his legs and how he was ready to strap up and give death a wrestle\".<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/> Shay wrote that Algren later commented that this poem was probably key to everything he had ever written.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/>\n\n===Influence===\nIn the fall of 1955, Algren was interviewed for ''[[The Paris Review]]'' by rising author [[Terry Southern]]. Algren and Southern became friends through this meeting and remained in touch for many years. Algren became one of Southern's most enthusiastic early supporters and, when he taught creative writing in later years, he often used Southern as an example of a great short story writer.<ref>Hill, Lee - ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.63-64</ref>\n\n===Hurricane Carter and Paterson, New Jersey===\nIn 1975, Algren was commissioned to write a magazine article about the trial of [[Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], the prize fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. While researching the article, Algren visited Carter's hometown of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Algren was instantly fascinated by the city of Paterson and he immediately decided to move there. In the summer of 1975, Algren sold off most of his belongings, left Chicago, and moved into an apartment in Paterson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Springer|first=Mike|title=Nelson Algren, the Exiled King|url=http://www.openculture.com/2011/06/nelson_algren_the_exiled_king.html|publisher=Open Culture|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Posthumous works===\nThe article about Carter had grown into a novel, ''The Devil's Stocking'', which was published posthumously in 1983.<ref name=\"bandw\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nalgren.htm |title=Nelson Algren |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205023601/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/nalgren.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1996, the book ''[[Nonconformity (literature)|Nonconformity]]'' was published by [[Seven Stories Press]], presenting Algren's view of the difficulties surrounding the 1956 film adaptation of ''The Man With the Golden Arm''. ''Nonconformity'' also presents the belief system behind Algren's writing and a call to writers everywhere to investigate the dark and represent the ignored.\n\nSeven Stories Press later published the novel fragment ''Entrapment'', along with other unpublished Algren fiction and reportage, as ''Entrapment and Other Writings'' in 2009. ''The Neon Wilderness'' and ''The Last Carousel'' were reprinted by Seven Stories  Press and recognized as  the [[Library Journal]] Editors' Best Reprints of 1997.\n\n==WWII military service and Vietnam==\nAlgren served as a private in the [[European Theater]] of [[World War II]] as a litter bearer. Despite being a college graduate, he was denied entry into Officer Candidate School. There is conjecture that this may have been due to suspicion regarding his political beliefs, although his criminal conviction would have most likely excluded him from OCS.\n\nAccording to Bettina Drew in her 1989 biography ''Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side'', Algren had no desire to serve in the war but was drafted in 1943. An indifferent soldier, he actively dealt on the [[black market]] while stationed in France. He received a bad beating by some fellow black marketeers.\n\nIn 1968, he signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>\n\nAccording to Drew's biography, Algren angled for a journalism job in [[South Vietnam]]. Strapped for cash more than a decade after his only two commercially successful novels, he saw Vietnam as an opportunity to make money, not from journalism fees, but from dealing on the black market.\n\n==Death and honors==\n===Medal of Merit and Academy Membership===\nIn 1980, he moved to a house in [[Sag Harbor]], [[Long Island]]. Three months before he died of a heart attack at home on May 9, 1981, he was elected to the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]. He previously had been awarded the Award of Merit Medal for the novel in 1974 by the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the forerunner to the Academy.  (Algren previously had won an Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the Institute in 1947.)  In 2010, Algren was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/nelson-algren |title=Nelson Algren |date=2010 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===O. Henry Awards===\nAlgren won his first [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story \"The Brother's House\" (published in ''[[Story Magazine]]'') in 1935.

He had met her at a party celebrating the publication of ''[[Somebody in Boots]]''. They eventually would divorce and remarry before divorcing a second and final time.\n\nAlgren had an affair with [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. The couple summered together in Algren's cottage in the lake front community of [[Miller Beach]], Indiana, and also traveled to [[Latin America]] together in 1949. In her novel ''[[The Mandarins]]'' (1954), Beauvoir wrote of Algren (who is 'Lewis Brogan' in the book):\n\n<blockquote>At first I found it amusing meeting in the flesh that classic American species: self-made leftist writer. Now, I began taking an interest in Brogan. Through his stories, you got the feeling that he claimed no rights to life and that nevertheless he had always had a passionate desire to live. I liked that mixture of modesty and eagerness.</blockquote>\n\nAlgren expected the world's most famous [[feminist]] to love him in a traditional way, with the man being dominant, but Beauvoir's relationship with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] dominated her life. Algren and Beauvoir eventually became disenchanted with each other, and a bitter Algren wrote of Beauvoir and Sartre in a ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine article about a trip he took to [[North Africa]] with Beauvoir, that she and Sartre were bigger users of others than a prostitute and her pimp in their way.<ref>{{cite book|last =Taylor|first = Brian F.|date =2015|title= Gnomonic Verses|publisher = Universal Octopus| page= 123|isbn = 9780957190122}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he met Betty Ann Jones while teaching at the [[University of Iowa]]'s [[Writers Workshop]]. They married that year and divorced in 1967.<ref name=\"bandw\"/> According to [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who taught with him at Iowa in 1965, Algren's \"enthusiasm for writing, reading and gambling left little time for the duties of a married man.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Vonnegut|first=Kurt|title=Funny side of the street|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/01/classics.kurtvonnegut|work=Guadian.co.uk|publisher=Manchester Guardian|accessdate=September 7, 2011|location=London|date=December 31, 2004}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and FBI surveillance ==\nAlgren friend Stuart McCarrell described him as a \"gut radical,\" who generally sided with the downtrodden but was uninterested in ideological debates and politically inactive for most of his life.

Among other reasons, he cited negative experiences both he and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] had with party members.<ref name=\"McCarrell\" /> However, his involvement in groups deemed \"subversive\" during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] years drew the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).

Fine, Inc. 1988</ref>\n\nDuring the 1950s, Algren wished to travel to Paris with his romantic companion, [[Simone de Beauvoir]], but due to government surveillance his passport applications were denied.<ref name=\"Simon\" /> When he finally did get a passport in 1960, McCarrell concludes that \"it was too late. By then the relationship [with de Beauvoir] had changed subtly but decisively.\"<ref name=\"McCarrell\" />\n\n== Algren and Chicago Polonia ==\nAlgren described [[Ashland Avenue]] as figuratively connecting Chicago to [[Warsaw]] in Poland.<ref name=\"ShayP118\">Shay, Art. ''Nelson Algren's Chicago'', University of Illinois Press 1988, p. 118</ref> His own life involved [[Poles in Chicago|the Polish community of Chicago]] in many ways, including his second wife Amanda Kontowicz. His friend [[Art Shay]] wrote about Algren, who while gambling, listened to old Polish love songs sung by an elderly waitress.<ref name=\"ShayP119\">Shay, p. 119</ref> The city's [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]], where he lived for years, played a significant part in his literary output. Polish bars that Algren frequented in his gambling, such as the Bit of Poland on [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]], figured in such writings as ''[[Never Come Morning]]'' and ''The Man With the Golden Arm''.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/>\n\nHis novel ''Never Come Morning'' was published several years after the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], a period when Poles, like Jews, were labeled an inferior race by [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].<ref name=\"Reader\" /> Chicago's [[Polish-American]] leaders thought ''Never Come Morning'' played on these [[anti-polonism|anti-Polish stereotypes]], and launched a sustained campaign against the book through the Polish press, the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]], and other Polish-American institutions. Articles appeared in the local Polish newspapers and letters were sent to Mayor [[Edward Joseph Kelly|Ed Kelly]], the [[Chicago Public Library]], and Algren's publisher, [[Harper & Brothers]]. The general tone of the campaign is suggested by a ''Zgoda'' editorial that attacked his character and mental state, saw readers who got free copies as victims of a Nazi-financed plot, and said the novel proved a deep desire to harm ethnic Poles on Algren's part. The [[Polish American Council]] sent a copy of a resolution condemning the novel to the FBI. Algren and his publisher defended against these accusations, with the author telling a library meeting that the book was about the effects of poverty, regardless of national background. The mayor had the novel removed from the [[Chicago Public Library]] system, and it apparently remained absent for at least 20 years.<ref name=\"Reader\" /> At least two later efforts to commemorate Algren in Polish Downtown echoed the attacks on the novels.\n\nShortly after his death in 1981, his last Chicago residence at 1958 West Evergreen Street was noted by Chicago journalist [[Mike Royko]]. The walk-up apartment just east of Damen Avenue in the former [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]] neighborhood of [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]] was in an area that had been dominated by Polish immigrants and was once one of Chicago's toughest and most crowded neighborhoods. The renaming of Evergreen Street to Algren Street caused controversy and was almost immediately reversed.<ref>L\u00e9vy, Bernard-Henri. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200505/levy In the Footsteps of Tocqueville], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', May 2005</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Algren enthusiasts instigated the renaming after Algren of the [[Polonia Triangle|Polish Triangle]] in what had been the center of the [[Polish Downtown]]. Replacing the plaza's traditional name, the director of the [[Polish Museum of America]] predicted, would obliterate the history of Chicago ethnic Poles and insult ethnic Polish institutions and local businesses. In the end a compromise was reached where the Triangle kept its older name and a newly installed fountain was named after Algren and inscribed with a quotation about the city's working people protecting its essence, from Algren's essay \"[[Chicago: City on the Make]]\".<ref name=\"Reader\" />\n\n==Hoax broadcast==\nA passage featured in Algren's book ''The Devil's Stocking'' (1983) was broadcast on TV some six years earlier during the [[Southern Television broadcast interruption|Southern Television hoax]] in the UK which generated international publicity when students<ref name=Vrillon>{{cite book\n  | last = Paulu\n  | first = Burton\n  | title = Television and radio in the United Kingdom\n  | publisher = University of Minnesota Press\n  | date = October 1981\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/televisionradioi0000paul/page/179 179]\u2013180\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/televisionradioi0000paul\n  | url-access = registration\n  | quote = Vrillon.\n  | isbn = 978-0-8166-0941-3}}</ref> interrupted the regular broadcast through the Hannington transmitter of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] for six minutes on November 26, 1977.<ref name=Collegian>{{Cite news\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | author-link = \n  | last2 = \n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = 'Galactic' hoax startles viewers\n  | newspaper = The Daily Collegian\n  | pages = \n  | date = December 2, 1977\n  | url = http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DCG/1977/12/02&EntityId=Ar01803\n  | accessdate = September 13, 2009\n  | postscript = .\n  }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Issue No. 24 of ''[[Fortean Times]]''<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Diary of a Mad Planet: Fortean Times Issues 16-25\n  | publisher = John Brown Publishing Ltd\n  | year = 1995\n  | location =\n  | pages =\n  | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=06m7AAAACAAJ&dq=diary+of+a+mad+planet&ei=9X2uSvuDB5qEkASfoISXAw\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 1-870021-25-8}}</ref> (Winter 1977) transcribed the hoaxer's message as:\n\n<blockquote>This is the voice of Asteron.

In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the ''Fortean Times'' transcript of the 1977 hoax, and those of other American newspaper reports of the broadcast.

Winners are published in the newspaper and given $5,000. The award is viewed with more than a little irony by Algren admirers; the ''Tribune'' panned Algren's work in his lifetime, referring to ''Chicago: City on the Make'' as a \"highly scented object.\" In an afterword to that book, Algren accused the ''Tribun''e of imposing false viewpoints on the city and promoting mediocrity.\n\n[[Studs Terkel]], writer Warren Leming, and three others founded the Nelson Algren Committee in 1989. At the time, there was a renewed interest in Algren's work. ''Somebody in Boots'' and ''Never Come Morning'', both long out of print, had been republished in 1987. The first biography of Algren, Bettina Drew's ''Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side'', was published in 1989 by Putnam. All of Nelson Algren's words are now back in print.\n\nThe Committee awards community activists an annual Algren award and sponsors an Algren birthday party.

The latter was adapted as [[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|the 1962 film of the same name]] (directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]], screenplay by [[John Fante]]).\n\n==Early life==\nAlgren was born '''Nelson Ahlgren Abraham''' in [[Detroit]], Michigan, the son of Goldie (n\u00e9e Kalisher) and Gerson Abraham.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonalgrenlife00drew_1 |url-access=registration |quote=goldie kalisher algren. |title=Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side |year=1989 |via=[[Internet Archive]] |author=Bettina Drew |publisher=Putnam |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref> At the age of three, he moved with his parents to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where they lived in a working-class, immigrant neighborhood on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]]. His father was the son of a [[Swedes|Swedish]] convert to [[Judaism]] and of a German Jewish woman, and his mother was of [[German Jews|German Jewish]] descent. (She owned a candy store on the South Side.) When he was young, Algren's family lived at 7139 S. South Park Avenue (now S. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) in the [[Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago|Greater Grand Crossing]] section of the South Side.<ref name=\"Biblio\" />\n\nWhen he was eight, his family moved from the far South Side to an apartment at 4834 N.

Before returning to Chicago, he was caught stealing a typewriter from an empty classroom at Sul Ross State University in Alpine. He boarded a train for his getaway but was apprehended and returned to Alpine. He was held in jail for nearly five months and faced a possible additional three years in prison. He was released, but the incident made a deep impression on him. It deepened his identification with outsiders, has-beens, and the general failures who later populated his fictional world.\n\nIn 1935 Algren won the first of his three [[O. Henry Awards]] for his short story, \"The Brother's House.\" The story was first published in ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine and was reprinted in an anthology of O. Henry Award winners.\n\n===Early books===\nHis first novel, ''[[Somebody in Boots]]'' (1935), was later dismissed by Algren as primitive and politically naive, claiming he infused it with [[Marxist]] ideas he little understood, because they were fashionable at the time. The book was unsuccessful and went out of print.\n\nHis second novel, ''Never Come Morning'' (1942), was described by [[Andrew O'Hagan]] in 2019 as \"the book that really shows the Algren style in its first great flourishing.\" It portrays the dead-end life of a doomed young [[Polish-American]] boxer turned criminal.<ref name=\"O'Hagan\">{{cite news|last=O'Hagan|first=Andrew|url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/11/07/nelson-algren-singing-back-streets/|title=Singing the Back Streets|work=The New York Review of Books|date=November 7, 2019|access-date=October 21, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> [[Ernest Hemingway]], in a July 8, 1942, letter to his publisher [[Maxwell Perkins]], said of the novel: \"I think it very, very good. It is as fine and good stuff to come out of Chicago.\" The novel offended members of Chicago's large Polish-American community, some of whose members denounced it as pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] propaganda. Not knowing that Algren was of partly Jewish descent, some incensed Polish-American Chicagoans said he was pro-[[Nazi]] Nordic. His Polish-American critics persuaded Mayor [[Edward Joseph Kelly]] to ban the novel from the [[Chicago Public Library]].\n\nHis first short-story collection, ''[[The Neon Wilderness]]'' (1947), collected 24 stories from 1933 to 1947. The same year, Algren received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and a grant from Chicago's [[Newberry Library]].<ref>[[Google Books]], [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_neon_wilderness.html?id=bEBaAAAAMAAJ ''The Neon Wilderness'']: \"Algren received a 1947 Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a grant from Chicago's Newberry Library.\"</ref>\n\n===Highest profile===\nAlgren is best known for his novel ''[[The Man With the Golden Arm (novel)|The Man With the Golden Arm]]'' (1949), which won the [[National Book Award for Fiction]] in 1950.<ref name=nba1950>\n[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1950 \"National Book Awards \u2013 1950\"].

Frankie is trapped in [[demimonde]] Chicago, having picked up a [[morphine]] habit during his brief military service during [[World War II]]. He is married to a woman whom he mistakenly believes became crippled in a car accident he caused.\n\nAlgren's next book, ''[[Chicago, City on the Make]]'' (1951), was a scathing essay that outraged the city's boosters but portrayed the back alleys of the city, its dispossessed, its corrupt politicians and its swindlers. Algren also declared his love of the City as a \"lovely so real\".\n\n''The Man With the Golden Arm'' was adapted as a [[The Man With the Golden Arm|1955 movie]] of the same name, starring [[Frank Sinatra]] and directed and produced by [[Otto Preminger]]. Algren soon withdrew from direct involvement. It was a commercial success but Algren loathed the film.<ref name=\"O'Hagan\" /> He sued Preminger seeking an injunction to stop him from claiming ownership of the property as \"An Otto Preminger film\", but he soon withdrew his suit for financial reasons.<ref name=\"Fujiwara\">{{cite book|last=Fujiwara|first=Chris|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z-2-CQAAQBAJ&pg=PA194|title=The World and Its Double: The Life and Work of Otto Preminger|location=New York City|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=2008|page=194}}</ref>\n\nAlgren had his last mainstream success with the novel ''[[A Walk on the Wild Side]]'' (1956). He reworked some of the material from his first novel, ''Somebody in Boots'', as well as picking up elements from several published short stories, such as his 1947 \"The Face on the Barroom Floor\".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The novel was about a wandering Texan adrift during the early years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He said it was superior to the earlier book. It was adapted as the [[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|1962 movie]] of the same name. Some critics thought the film [[bowdlerized]] the book, and it was not commercially successful.\n\nAlgren played a small part in [[Philip Kaufman]]'s underground comedy ''[[Fearless Frank]]'' (1967) as a mobster named Needles.\n\n===Legacy===\nAlgren articulated the world of \"drunks, pimps, prostitutes, freaks, drug addicts, prize fighters, corrupt politicians, and hoodlums\". [[Art Shay]] wrote, years later, about how Algren had written a poem from the perspective of a \"halfy\", street slang for a legless man on wheels.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/> The protagonist talks about \"how forty wheels rolled over his legs and how he was ready to strap up and give death a wrestle\".<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/> Shay wrote that Algren later commented that this poem was probably key to everything he had ever written.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/>\n\n===Influence===\nIn the fall of 1955, Algren was interviewed for ''[[The Paris Review]]'' by rising author [[Terry Southern]]. Algren and Southern became friends through this meeting and remained in touch for many years. Algren became one of Southern's most enthusiastic early supporters and, when he taught creative writing in later years, he often used Southern as an example of a great short story writer.<ref>Hill, Lee - ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.63-64</ref>\n\n===Hurricane Carter and Paterson, New Jersey===\nIn 1975, Algren was commissioned to write a magazine article about the trial of [[Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], the prize fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. While researching the article, Algren visited Carter's hometown of [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Algren was instantly fascinated by the city of Paterson and he immediately decided to move there. In the summer of 1975, Algren sold off most of his belongings, left Chicago, and moved into an apartment in Paterson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Springer|first=Mike|title=Nelson Algren, the Exiled King|url=http://www.openculture.com/2011/06/nelson_algren_the_exiled_king.html|publisher=Open Culture|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Posthumous works===\nThe article about Carter had grown into a novel, ''The Devil's Stocking'', which was published posthumously in 1983.<ref name=\"bandw\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/nalgren.htm |title=Nelson Algren |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205023601/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/nalgren.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1996, the book ''[[Nonconformity (literature)|Nonconformity]]'' was published by [[Seven Stories Press]], presenting Algren's view of the difficulties surrounding the 1956 film adaptation of ''The Man With the Golden Arm''. ''Nonconformity'' also presents the belief system behind Algren's writing and a call to writers everywhere to investigate the dark and represent the ignored.\n\nSeven Stories Press later published the novel fragment ''Entrapment'', along with other unpublished Algren fiction and reportage, as ''Entrapment and Other Writings'' in 2009. ''The Neon Wilderness'' and ''The Last Carousel'' were reprinted by Seven Stories  Press and recognized as  the [[Library Journal]] Editors' Best Reprints of 1997.\n\n==WWII military service and Vietnam==\nAlgren served as a private in the [[European Theater]] of [[World War II]] as a litter bearer. Despite being a college graduate, he was denied entry into Officer Candidate School. There is conjecture that this may have been due to suspicion regarding his political beliefs, although his criminal conviction would have most likely excluded him from OCS.\n\nAccording to Bettina Drew in her 1989 biography ''Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side'', Algren had no desire to serve in the war but was drafted in 1943. An indifferent soldier, he actively dealt on the [[black market]] while stationed in France. He received a bad beating by some fellow black marketeers.\n\nIn 1968, he signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>\n\nAccording to Drew's biography, Algren angled for a journalism job in [[South Vietnam]]. Strapped for cash more than a decade after his only two commercially successful novels, he saw Vietnam as an opportunity to make money, not from journalism fees, but from dealing on the black market.\n\n==Death and honors==\n===Medal of Merit and Academy Membership===\nIn 1980, he moved to a house in [[Sag Harbor]], [[Long Island]]. Three months before he died of a heart attack at home on May 9, 1981, he was elected to the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]. He previously had been awarded the Award of Merit Medal for the novel in 1974 by the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the forerunner to the Academy.  (Algren previously had won an Arts and Letters Award in Literature from the Institute in 1947.)  In 2010, Algren was inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://chicagoliteraryhof.org/inductees/profile/nelson-algren |title=Nelson Algren |date=2010 |website=Chicago Literary Hall of Fame |language=en |access-date=October 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===O. Henry Awards===\nAlgren won his first [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story \"The Brother's House\" (published in ''[[Story Magazine]]'') in 1935. His short stories \"A Bottle of Milk for Mother (Biceps)\" (published in the ''[[Southern Review]]'') and \"The Captain is Impaled\" (''[[Harper's Magazine]]'') were O.

He had met her at a party celebrating the publication of ''[[Somebody in Boots]]''. They eventually would divorce and remarry before divorcing a second and final time.\n\nAlgren had an affair with [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. The couple summered together in Algren's cottage in the lake front community of [[Miller Beach]], Indiana, and also traveled to [[Latin America]] together in 1949. In her novel ''[[The Mandarins]]'' (1954), Beauvoir wrote of Algren (who is 'Lewis Brogan' in the book):\n\n<blockquote>At first I found it amusing meeting in the flesh that classic American species: self-made leftist writer. Now, I began taking an interest in Brogan. Through his stories, you got the feeling that he claimed no rights to life and that nevertheless he had always had a passionate desire to live. I liked that mixture of modesty and eagerness.</blockquote>\n\nAlgren expected the world's most famous [[feminist]] to love him in a traditional way, with the man being dominant, but Beauvoir's relationship with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] dominated her life. Algren and Beauvoir eventually became disenchanted with each other, and a bitter Algren wrote of Beauvoir and Sartre in a ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine article about a trip he took to [[North Africa]] with Beauvoir, that she and Sartre were bigger users of others than a prostitute and her pimp in their way.<ref>{{cite book|last =Taylor|first = Brian F.|date =2015|title= Gnomonic Verses|publisher = Universal Octopus| page= 123|isbn = 9780957190122}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he met Betty Ann Jones while teaching at the [[University of Iowa]]'s [[Writers Workshop]]. They married that year and divorced in 1967.<ref name=\"bandw\"/> According to [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who taught with him at Iowa in 1965, Algren's \"enthusiasm for writing, reading and gambling left little time for the duties of a married man.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Vonnegut|first=Kurt|title=Funny side of the street|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/01/classics.kurtvonnegut|work=Guadian.co.uk|publisher=Manchester Guardian|accessdate=September 7, 2011|location=London|date=December 31, 2004}}</ref>\n\n== Political views and FBI surveillance ==\nAlgren friend Stuart McCarrell described him as a \"gut radical,\" who generally sided with the downtrodden but was uninterested in ideological debates and politically inactive for most of his life.

''Nelson Algren's Chicago'', University of Illinois Press 1988, p. 118</ref> His own life involved [[Poles in Chicago|the Polish community of Chicago]] in many ways, including his second wife Amanda Kontowicz. His friend [[Art Shay]] wrote about Algren, who while gambling, listened to old Polish love songs sung by an elderly waitress.<ref name=\"ShayP119\">Shay, p. 119</ref> The city's [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]], where he lived for years, played a significant part in his literary output. Polish bars that Algren frequented in his gambling, such as the Bit of Poland on [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]], figured in such writings as ''[[Never Come Morning]]'' and ''The Man With the Golden Arm''.<ref name=\"ShayP118\"/>\n\nHis novel ''Never Come Morning'' was published several years after the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], a period when Poles, like Jews, were labeled an inferior race by [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].<ref name=\"Reader\" /> Chicago's [[Polish-American]] leaders thought ''Never Come Morning'' played on these [[anti-polonism|anti-Polish stereotypes]], and launched a sustained campaign against the book through the Polish press, the [[Polish Roman Catholic Union of America]], and other Polish-American institutions. Articles appeared in the local Polish newspapers and letters were sent to Mayor [[Edward Joseph Kelly|Ed Kelly]], the [[Chicago Public Library]], and Algren's publisher, [[Harper & Brothers]]. The general tone of the campaign is suggested by a ''Zgoda'' editorial that attacked his character and mental state, saw readers who got free copies as victims of a Nazi-financed plot, and said the novel proved a deep desire to harm ethnic Poles on Algren's part. The [[Polish American Council]] sent a copy of a resolution condemning the novel to the FBI. Algren and his publisher defended against these accusations, with the author telling a library meeting that the book was about the effects of poverty, regardless of national background. The mayor had the novel removed from the [[Chicago Public Library]] system, and it apparently remained absent for at least 20 years.<ref name=\"Reader\" /> At least two later efforts to commemorate Algren in Polish Downtown echoed the attacks on the novels.\n\nShortly after his death in 1981, his last Chicago residence at 1958 West Evergreen Street was noted by Chicago journalist [[Mike Royko]]. The walk-up apartment just east of Damen Avenue in the former [[Polish Downtown (Chicago)|Polish Downtown]] neighborhood of [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]] was in an area that had been dominated by Polish immigrants and was once one of Chicago's toughest and most crowded neighborhoods. The renaming of Evergreen Street to Algren Street caused controversy and was almost immediately reversed.<ref>L\u00e9vy, Bernard-Henri. [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200505/levy In the Footsteps of Tocqueville], ''The Atlantic Monthly'', May 2005</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Algren enthusiasts instigated the renaming after Algren of the [[Polonia Triangle|Polish Triangle]] in what had been the center of the [[Polish Downtown]]. Replacing the plaza's traditional name, the director of the [[Polish Museum of America]] predicted, would obliterate the history of Chicago ethnic Poles and insult ethnic Polish institutions and local businesses. In the end a compromise was reached where the Triangle kept its older name and a newly installed fountain was named after Algren and inscribed with a quotation about the city's working people protecting its essence, from Algren's essay \"[[Chicago: City on the Make]]\".<ref name=\"Reader\" />\n\n==Hoax broadcast==\nA passage featured in Algren's book ''The Devil's Stocking'' (1983) was broadcast on TV some six years earlier during the [[Southern Television broadcast interruption|Southern Television hoax]] in the UK which generated international publicity when students<ref name=Vrillon>{{cite book\n  | last = Paulu\n  | first = Burton\n  | title = Television and radio in the United Kingdom\n  | publisher = University of Minnesota Press\n  | date = October 1981\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/televisionradioi0000paul/page/179 179]\u2013180\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/televisionradioi0000paul\n  | url-access = registration\n  | quote = Vrillon.\n  | isbn = 978-0-8166-0941-3}}</ref> interrupted the regular broadcast through the Hannington transmitter of the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] for six minutes on November 26, 1977.<ref name=Collegian>{{Cite news\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | author-link = \n  | last2 = \n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = 'Galactic' hoax startles viewers\n  | newspaper = The Daily Collegian\n  | pages = \n  | date = December 2, 1977\n  | url = http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DCG/1977/12/02&EntityId=Ar01803\n  | accessdate = September 13, 2009\n  | postscript = .\n  }}{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Issue No. 24 of ''[[Fortean Times]]''<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = Diary of a Mad Planet: Fortean Times Issues 16-25\n  | publisher = John Brown Publishing Ltd\n  | year = 1995\n  | location =\n  | pages =\n  | url = https://www.google.com/books?id=06m7AAAACAAJ&dq=diary+of+a+mad+planet&ei=9X2uSvuDB5qEkASfoISXAw\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 1-870021-25-8}}</ref> (Winter 1977) transcribed the hoaxer's message as:\n\n<blockquote>This is the voice of Asteron.

In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character 'Kenyatta' gives a speech closely mirroring the ''Fortean Times'' transcript of the 1977 hoax, and those of other American newspaper reports of the broadcast. The passage in Algren's book says:\n\n<blockquote>I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission,\" Kenyatta finally disclosed his credentials. \"I have a message for the Planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed.

In that song Patrick Costello sings \"Nelson Algren came to me and said, 'Celebrate the ugly things' / The beat-up side of what they call pride could be the measure of these days.\"\n*The 2002 album ''Adult World'' by guitarist [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] (founding member of the Detroit band [[MC5]]) contains a song titled \"Nelson Algren Stopped By,\" in which guest band X-Mars-X provides a shuffling jazz background while Kramer reads a prose poem about walking the streets of present-day Chicago with Algren.\n*In 2005, [[The Hold Steady]] mentioned Algren in the song \"Chicago Seemed Tired Last Night\" from the ''[[Separation Sunday]]'' album. The first line of the song is \"Nelson Algren came to Paddy at some party at the Dead End Alley/He told him what to celebrate\" and toward the end the song goes \"Hey Nelson Algren. Chicago seemed tired last night/They had cigarettes where there were supposed to be eyes.\" The name 'Paddy' in the song is a reference to Patrick Costello and the 'Dead End Alley' is the name of the house where the [[Dillinger Four]]'s members used to live.\n*[[The Devil Wears Prada]] on their 2019 album [[The Act]] has the song \"Please Say No\" which is based off the novel \"Never Come Morning\"\n</ref>{{cite|url+webhttps://metalinjection.net/av/new-music/the-devil-wears-prada-slows-down-on-new-song-please-say-no}}</ref>\n===Onstage===\n*In 1988, ''A Walk on the Wild Side'' was staged as a musical at the Back Alley Theatre in Van Nuys, California. [[Will Holt]], who wrote the book, music, and lyrics, went on to win the Los Angeles Dramalogue Critics Award for his work.\n*In 2000, [[John Susman]]'s play ''Nelson & Simone'' was produced at Chicago's [[Live Bait Theatre]], directed by Richard Cotovsky,<ref>{{IMDb name|0019346}}</ref> and starring Gary Houston and Rebecca Covey. The play dramatizes the love affair between Algren and [[Simone de Beauvoir]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livebaittheater.org/LIve_Bait_Theater/Productions.html |title=Live Bait Theater production history |publisher=Livebaittheater.org |date= |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Nelson Algren Award ==\nEach year the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gives a Nelson Algren award for short fiction. Winners are published in the newspaper and given $5,000. The award is viewed with more than a little irony by Algren admirers; the ''Tribune'' panned Algren's work in his lifetime, referring to ''Chicago: City on the Make'' as a \"highly scented object.\" In an afterword to that book, Algren accused the ''Tribun''e of imposing false viewpoints on the city and promoting mediocrity.\n\n[[Studs Terkel]], writer Warren Leming, and three others founded the Nelson Algren Committee in 1989. At the time, there was a renewed interest in Algren's work. ''Somebody in Boots'' and ''Never Come Morning'', both long out of print, had been republished in 1987. The first biography of Algren, Bettina Drew's ''Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side'', was published in 1989 by Putnam. All of Nelson Algren's words are now back in print.\n\nThe Committee awards community activists an annual Algren award and sponsors an Algren birthday party. Leming's song \"Algren Street\" can be downloaded from the Committee's [http://www.nelsonalgren.org website]. The site also contains the short film ''Algren's Last Night'', written by Leming and directed by Carmine Cervi.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n=== Novels ===\n* ''[[Somebody in Boots]]''. 1935; as ''The Jungle'', Avon, 1957.\n* ''Never Come Morning''.
