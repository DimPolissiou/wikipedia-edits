In 1985 she co-edited the State of India's Environment report, and then went on to study issues related to [[forestry|forest management]]. For this project, she traveled across the country to understand people's management of [[natural resources]]. In 1989 Narain and Anil Agarwal wrote 'Towards Green Villages' on the subject of local democracy and sustainable development. In her years at the Centre, she has studied the relationship between [[ecosystem|environment]] and [[Development studies|development]] and worked to create public consciousness about the need for [[sustainable development]]. In 2012, she wrote the 7th State of India's Environment Reports, Excreta Matters, an analysis of urban [[India's water supply]] and [[Environmental issues in India|pollution]].\n\nOver the years, Narain has also developed the management and financial support systems needed for the Centre, which has over 100 staff members and a dynamic program profile. In the early 1990s, she got involved with global environmental issues and she continues to work on these as researcher and advocate. Her research interests are wide-ranging - from [[Democratic mundialization|global democracy]], with a special focus on [[climate change]], to the need for [[direct democracy|local democracy]], within which she has worked both on forest-related resource management and water-related issues. Narain remains an active participant, both nationally and internationally, in civil society.<ref name=Bio/> She is currently in charge of the Centre's management and plays an active role in a number of research projects and public campaigns.<ref name=Bio/> \n\nShe serves on the boards of various organizations and on governmental committees and has spoken at many forums across the world on issues of her concern and expertise.

All dates from the passport stamps of Saudi Arabia are written in the [[Islamic calendar|Hijra Calendar]].]]\nA '''passport stamp''' is an inked impression in a [[passport]] typically made by rubber stamp upon entering or exiting a territory.\n\nPassport stamps may occasionally take the form of sticker stamps, such as entry stamps from [[Visa policy of Japan|Japan]]. Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps. A few countries issue only entry stamps, including [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada]], [[Visa policy of El Salvador|El Salvador]], [[Visa policy of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Visa policy of New Zealand|New Zealand]], the [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and the [[Visa policy of the United States|United States]]. \n\n[[Visa policy of Australia|Australia]], [[Visa policy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Visa policy of Israel|Israel]], [[Visa policy of Macau|Macau]] and [[Visa policy of South Korea|South Korea]] do not stamp passports upon entry nor exit, but issue landing slips instead. [[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit. Handwritten scroll numbers on the stamp make it easier to track a person's complete journey - a Bangladeshi leaving Bangladesh would receive a scroll number upon exit; upon entry, the scroll number would be used to access related journey information of the traveller. The same is the case for foreigners, except that the scroll number is given on entry and then used on exit.\n\nThe stamps are always in black except the date, which is in red. The stamps feature an arrow at the top left corner, pointing left to denote departure, or pointing right for arrival together with a cartoon of the mode of transport at the top right corner.\n\nEntry stamps are rectangular and exit stamps are oval, exit make it visually easier to trace movements.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Bahrain====\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''entry''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bahrain exit stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Bahrain '''exit''' stamp obtained at [[Bahrain International Airport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Cambodia====\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia bavet passport stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp at [[Bavet]] land border crossing on the Cambodia-Vietnam border.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Visa cambodia Manfred Werner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Pre-sticker visas together with older type of passport stamps at [[Siem Reap]] airport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Cambodia exit stamp.png|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp issued at [[Siem Reap International Airport]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====China====\n<gallery>\nFile:Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] in an old [[People's Republic of China passport]].\nFile:Dongguan passport stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Dongguan]] in an old People's Republic of China passport.<br>(Noted that there were no English on stamps.)\nFile:Fuzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Fuzhou Changle International Airport]] in an old [[Thai passport]].\nFile:Guangzhou stamps.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport]] in a Thai passport.\nFile:China Visa Stamp.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] on an [[Italian passport]].\nFile:China Immigration Stramps Beijing.jpg|Entry and exit stamps at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Hong Kong====\nThe [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] used to stamp the passports of visitors entering and leaving Hong Kong (residents using their [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] did not receive a stamp).

Also, the passports are still stamped (as of February 2014) at the land borders of [[Jordan River Crossing]] and [[Yitzhak Rabin Crossing]] with Jordan and [[Taba Border Crossing]] with Egypt.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Israel Taba Border Entry.JPG|Entry stamp to [[Israel]] from [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]] in an [[Israeli passport]].\nFile:Israel Entry Stamp.jpg|An Israeli entry stamp in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]] at Ben Gurion Airport.\nFile:Israel - Visa entry and exit (3 months).jpg|Entry and exit stamps in a [[German passport]] at Ben Gurion Airport (entry: right; exit: left).\nFile:Israel Entry Paper.jpg|An Israeli entry paper at Ben Gurion Airport.\nFile:Israel Exit Paper.jpg|An Israeli exit paper at Ben Gurion Airport.\n</gallery>\n\n====Japan====\n{{stack|[[File:Japan Stamp Chubu Fukuoka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Former Temporary visitor landing permission sticker at [[Chubu Centrair International Airport]] and exit stamp at [[Fukuoka Airport]] in a [[Republic of Korea passport]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Haneda return stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Return stamp at Haneda airport in a [[Japanese passport]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Fukuoka re-entry stamp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Departure and re-entry stamps for a foreign resident of Japan in a [[British passport]].]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Jordan====\n{{stack|[[File:The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Employment Visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Aqaba Special Economic Zone Authority]] visa in a U.S. passport.]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan Wadi Araba Entry.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry stamp in a U.S. passport at [[Wadi Araba Crossing]].]]}}\n{{stack|[[File:Jordan Wadi Araba Crossing exit 2010.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Exit stamp in an Israeli passport at [[Wadi Araba Crossing]]]]}}\n{{clear}}\n\n====Laos====\n[[File:Laos.Visa.JPG|thumb|left|upright=2.3|Entry and exit stamps at the [[Thai\u2013Lao Friendship Bridge]]]]\n{{clear}}\n\n====Macau====\nImmigration stamps applied by [[Macau]]'s immigration service under [[Portugal|Portuguese]] administration had slightly different borders depending on whether the person arrived by land, sea, or air. After the transfer of sovereignty from Portugal to China in 1999, passport stamps naming the points of entry and departure were introduced, but all in the same ink color. Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

The blue stamp at the left corner is from the [[United Arab Emirates|Emirati]] side of Wajaja.  ]]\nAs of December 2017, one who obtains a visa on arrival does not get a round entry stamp. Instead they get a rectangular, blue stamp that states the entry date and validity of the visa. This seems to, however, be the case only when arriving at [[Muscat International Airport]]. At land borders, the rectangular stamp is accompanied by a round, blue entry stamp. A round, red exit stamp is issued at all points of exit.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pakistan====\nA circular entry stamp in black ink is applied to passports of all nationalities at the time of entry. A triangular multi colored entry stamp was used until 2015. An exit stamp is also applied to all passports when leaving the country.

As a general rule, passports of all travellers regardless of their nationality (including Filipino passport holders), need to be stamped at both entry and exit points. The attending officer also writes down the flight number and stamps the passenger's boarding pass upon departure with the same stamp that is used for departure. The shape and/or designs of the stamps are changed every five to six years.<gallery>\nFile:PH ArrivalStmp.jpg|Arrival Entry Stamp in a Philippine Passport\nFile:PH DepartureStmp.jpg|Departure Exit Stamp in a Philippine Passport\n</gallery>\n\n====Saudi Arabia====\nSaudi entry stamps are in black or blue ink.

Exit stamps are circular and in green. Both depict the date of entry/exit and entry stamps also state the terms of entry and permitted duration of stay.\n\nBoth entry and exit stamps do not name the point of entry/exit but indicate them by the use of letters of the alphabet - \"A\" is used for entry by air, namely through [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] or Seletar Airport; \"S\" by sea though the Singapore Cruiseship Terminal or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal; \"T\" by land via the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link|Tuas Checkpoint]]; and \"W\" by land via the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Woodlands Checkpoint]]. The entry stamp has the letter running along the border of the stamp together with a code number while the exit stamp has a single letter marked in the center of the stamp. From 22 April 2019, foreign travellers no longer get their passports stamped when they depart from Singapore. <ref>[https://www.gov.sg/news/content/foreigners-departing-spore-will-not-have-passports-stamped-from-april-22 ]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Singapore Changi Airport entry stamp in a passport - 20040409.jpg|Entry stamp at Changi Airport in an old Thai Passport\nFile:Singapore Changi Airport exit stamp in a passport - 20091213.jpg|Exit stamp at Changi Airport\nFile:Singapore Cruise Centre entry and exit stamps in a passport - 20070415.jpg|Entry and exit by sea, at the Singapore Cruise Center.\nFile:Singapore Tuas Checkpoint entry stamp in a passport - 20071103.jpg|Entry stamp into Singapore via Tuas Checkpoint in a [[Malaysian Passport]]\nFile:Singapore Tuas Checkpoint exit stamp in a passport - 20070722.jpg|Exit stamp in a Malaysian Passport for leaving Singapore to Tanjung Kupang in Johor, Malaysia, via the Tuas Checkpoint\nFile:Woodlands entry.JPG|Entry stamp at Singapore via [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] in a Malaysian Passport\nFile:Woodlands exit.JPG|Exit stamp in a Malaysian Passport for leaving Singapore to Johor Bahru via Woodlands Train Checkpoint\n</gallery>\n\n====Sri Lanka====\n<gallery>\nFile:Sri Lankan entry stamp.jpg|Entry stamp at [[Bandaranaike International Airport]]\nFile:Sri Lankan exit stamp.jpg|Exit stamp at Bandaranaike International Airport\n</gallery>\n\n====South Korea====\nEntry stamp is square shaped and stamped with magenta ink.

Entry stamp is only omitted to Republic of Korea travel document holder since 10 February 2011. Beginning January 2018, landing slips are issued to visitors on arrival in South Korea instead of passport stamps, and on departure from South Korea no slips or passport stamps are issued (being unable to present the landing slip on departure does not affect a traveller's ability to clear immigration).

This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

This concession mainly applied to school groups travelling within the [[European Economic Area]], though it was also extended to some other groups, such as elderly passengers, travellers with special needs, brownie and scout groups and sports teams.

However, as third-country nationals (who do not benefit from one of the exemptions in the right-hand column above) are required to receive a passport stamp, the French Border Police will give them an information sheet when they leave metropolitan France informing them that they should present themselves to the French Border Police at the arrival airport to receive a passport stamp. On the other hand, travellers flying directly from Guadeloupe, Martinique or Saint Pierre and Miquelon to metropolitan France undergo border checks by the [[French Border Police]] both on departure and on arrival, when their travel documents will be stamped accordingly.<ref name=\"Double controle\"/>\n\nWhilst the rules for stamping travel documents of travellers arriving in and departing from the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above are based upon the rules which apply in [[metropolitan France]] and the [[Schengen Area]] (see the section above), important differences exist between the two sets of rules. For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|Directive 2004/38/EC]] '''and''' who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas departments/collectivities mentioned above, more generous rules apply \u2014 when entering/leaving Guadeloupe/Martinique/Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member; when entering/leaving Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin, a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence card issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether the residence card was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]]. Previously, entry stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities were rectangular, whilst exit stamps were hexagonal. Under the current design, both entry and exit stamps issued in French overseas departments/collectivities are hexagonal and have a similar design to Schengen Area stamps. The top left corner states Outre-Mer and F, and indicates the 3-digit [[INSEE code]] for the [[Departments of France|overseas department/collectivity]] where the stamp was issued (971 for [[Guadeloupe]], 972 for [[Martinique]], 975 for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], 978 for [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]).\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Enreisestempel Guadeloupe.png|Entry stamp at the port of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre ([[Guadeloupe]]) in a Swedish passport\nFile:Guadeloupe-Stempel.png|Exit stamp at [[Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre International Airport]] ([[Guadeloupe]]) in a Swedish passport\nFile:Martinique-Stempel.png|Entry (top) and exit (bottom) stamps at the ferry dock in [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint-Pierre]] ([[Martinique]]) in a Swedish passport.

For example, when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], only family members of [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizens who hold a residence card issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC and who are accompanying or joining their EU, EEA and Swiss citizen family member exercising the right of freedom of movement are exempt from having their travel documents stamped, whereas in the French overseas territories in the Pacific, more generous rules apply \u2014 a family member of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]]/[[Swiss]] citizen who holds a residence permit issued by an EU/EEA member state or Switzerland is exempt from having his/her travel document stamped regardless of whether he/she is accompanying/joining his/her EU/EEA/Swiss citizen family member and regardless of whether his/her residence permit was issued under Article 10 of Directive 2004/38/EC. Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] - when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas territory in the Pacific, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\"/> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas territories in the Pacific differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

Depending on nationality, a visitor may not receive a stamp at all (unless specifically requested), such as an [[European Union|EU]] or [[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] citizen travelling to an [[Schengen Area|EU or EFTA country]], [[Visa policy of Albania|Albania]],<ref name=\"parlament.al\">[https://www.parlament.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ligj-71.pdf]</ref> or [[Visa policy of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]].<ref>[http://www.mvr.gov.mk/Upload/Documents/ZAKON%20ZA%20GRANI%5ENA%20KONTROLA.pdf]</ref> Most countries issue exit stamps in addition to entry stamps.

[[Visa (document)|Visas]] may also take the form of passport stamps.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Japan entry and exit stamps.jpg|thumb|Japanese entry and exit stamps showing QR codes]]\nBorder control officials often place stamps in passports as part of their immigration control or customs procedures. This endorsement can serve many different purposes. In the United Kingdom the immigration stamp in the passport includes the formal \"[[leave to enter]]\" granted on entry to the country to a person who is subject to immigration control. Alternatively, the stamps activate and/or acknowledge the continuing leave conferred by the individual's entry clearance. Other authorities, such as those in [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] member states, simply stamp a passport with a date stamp that does not indicate any duration and this stamp is taken to mean either that the person is deemed to have permission to remain for three months or an alternative period as shown on their visa. In Japan, the passport entry sticker also contains a [[QR code]] that allows the immigration official to electronically collect information related to that entry.\n\nMost countries have different stamps for arrivals and departures to make it easier for officers to quickly identify the movements of the person concerned. The colour of the ink or the style of stamp may also provide such information.\n\nIn many cases passengers on [[cruise ship]]s do not receive passport stamps because the entire vessel has been cleared into port.  It is often possible to get a souvenir stamp, although this requires finding the immigration office by the dock.  In many cases officials are used to such requests and will cooperate.<ref>[https://cruiseradio.net/5-cool-places-passport-stamps/ 5 Caribbean Ports to Get Your Passport Stamped]</ref><ref>[https://garyscohen.wordpress.com/2015/04/14/cruise-tales-2015-south-and-east-caribbean-6-in-search-of-passport-stamps/ Cruise Tales \u2013 2015 South and East Caribbean #6: In Search of Passport Stamps]</ref>  Also, as noted below, some of the smallest European countries will give a stamp on request, either at their border or tourist office charging, at most, a nominal fee.\n\n==Overview of passport stamps of countries==\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Bangladesh====\n{{stack| [[File:Entry and exit stamps of Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Entry and exit stamps at [[Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport]] on a [[Bangladeshi passport]].]]}}\n{{stack| [[File:Bangladeshi visa.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Bangladeshi visa in a [[United States passport|U.S. passport]].]]}}\nBangladesh stamps all travellers' passports upon both entry and exit.

Beginning of 9 July 2013, the [[Public Security Police Force of Macau]] no longer stamps passport and instead, visitors will receive a printed arrival card instead.<ref>[http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/45198-tens-of-thousands-of-hours-can-be-saved-by-non-stamping-immigration-clearance.html Tens of thousands of hours can be saved by non-stamping immigration clearance]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Macau Arrival Card.jpg|Arrival Card replacing existent passport stamps.\nFile:Macau Airport.jpg|Former entry stamp at [[Macau International Airport]].\nFile:Macau passport stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal, Macau]].\nFile:Taipa Macau stamp.jpg|Former entry and exit stamps at [[Taipa Temporary Ferry Terminal]] in a [[Philippine passport]].\n</gallery>\n\n====Malaysia====\nMalaysian immigration authorities apply stamps for both entry and exit in all foreign passports and non-biometric [[Malaysian passport]]s without in-built microchips. Biometric Malaysian passports are usually not stamped as all movements in and out of the country are recorded electronically in the microchip.\n\nMalaysian entry stamps for non-citizens and non-residents are rectangular and stamped in blue or black. They bear the date of entry, point of entry and terms of entry. Entry stamps for residents are also stamped in blue ink but have an oval shape and bear the date and point of entry. Exit stamps are triangular and stamped in red. They bear the date and point of departure.\n\nA peculiarity is the autonomy of the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in immigration affairs. This is attributed to the history of the federation of Malaysia, whereby in 1963, Malaya, North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore merged to form Malaysia, with the three latter pre-merger entities granted partial autonomy. (Singapore eventually was expelled from the union.)   Foreign visitors who travel to the two states from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] are required to fill in immigration forms and get new stamps on their passports. There is also immigration control for travel between Sabah and Sarawak. Previously, Malaysian citizens from the Peninsular were required to present their passports and have them stamped as well; while they are currently still subjected to immigration control, passports are no longer required for social visits not more than three months.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2011, foreign visitors who entered Malaysia via train from Singapore were cleared electronically without their passports being stamped.<ref>{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | title = Tanjong Pagar: Talks 'break down' | newspaper= [[New Straits Times]] | pages = 1, 7 | date = 31 July 1998 | url = }}</ref> The change was due to the dispute between Malaysia and Singapore regarding Malaysian-owned railway land in Singapore. The Malaysian railway operator, [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) had its intercity rail southern terminus at [[Tanjong Pagar railway station]] in downtown Singapore, which also housed the border controls of both Malaysia and Singapore for rail passengers before 1998. In 1998, Singapore moved its immigration checkpoint northward to [[Woodlands Train Checkpoint]] near the actual [[Malaysia-Singapore border]] but Malaysia refused to move its checkpoint, resulting in the anomaly that passengers travelling towards Malaysia were granted entry to Malaysia before passing through Singapore exit controls. Instead of passport stamps, foreign visitors were given [[arrival card|disembarkation card]]s stamped with \"KTM Tg Pagar, Singapura\" and the date of entry, which would be collected upon departure from Malaysia and a handwritten note indicating the entry would be endorsed in the passport along with the exit stamp. Passengers travelling to Singapore were not affected as Malaysian exit controls were carried out on board trains at the [[Johor Bahru railway station]], where immigration officers endorsed passports by stamping or handwriting. The anomaly was resolved on 1 July 2011, when Tanjong Pagar railway station was closed and Woodlands Train Checkpoint became the railway terminus in Singapore with co-location of border control facilities of both countries. Foreign visitors entering Malaysia by rail have their passports checked and stamped by Malaysian immigration officers at Woodlands Train Checkpoint after clearing Singapore exit controls.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Malaysia tawaujetty.JPG|Standard entry stamp, this one at [[Tawau]] Port, [[Sabah]], allowing three months' stay.\nFile:Malaysia merapok entry3.JPG|Entry stamp into Sarawak at Merapok checkpoint on the Sabah-Sarawak border, with written date for limit of stay.\nFile:Malaysia subang entry citizen.JPG|Entry stamp for citizens before biometric passports were introduced.

Instead they get a rectangular, blue stamp that states the entry date and validity of the visa. This seems to, however, be the case only when arriving at [[Muscat International Airport]]. At land borders, the rectangular stamp is accompanied by a round, blue entry stamp. A round, red exit stamp is issued at all points of exit.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Pakistan====\nA circular entry stamp in black ink is applied to passports of all nationalities at the time of entry.

As a general rule, passports of all travellers regardless of their nationality (including Filipino passport holders), need to be stamped at both entry and exit points.

Exit stamps are circular and in green. Both depict the date of entry/exit and entry stamps also state the terms of entry and permitted duration of stay.\n\nBoth entry and exit stamps do not name the point of entry/exit but indicate them by the use of letters of the alphabet - \"A\" is used for entry by air, namely through [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] or Seletar Airport; \"S\" by sea though the Singapore Cruiseship Terminal or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal; \"T\" by land via the [[Malaysia\u2013Singapore Second Link|Tuas Checkpoint]]; and \"W\" by land via the [[Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway|Woodlands Checkpoint]].

A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]], where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s, as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper indicating the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point the state of facilities are such that to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Uniform design of Schengen member states' passport stamps\">\nFile:Sandefjord passport stamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Sandefjord Airport]] in [[Norway]].<br/>(Note that the stamp is in a [[British passport]], hence it was issued on special request.)\nFile:Nickelsdorfpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Nickelsdorf]] at the Austro-Hungarian border before [[Hungary]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Greece doirani entry.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Doirani]] at the Greek-Macedonian border.\nFile:Ijmondpassportstamp.jpg|'''Entry stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Amsterdam]] IJmond in the [[Netherlands]].\nFile:Czech prague airport exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''air travel'', issued at [[Prague Ruzyn\u011b Airport]] in the [[Czech Republic]].\nFile:Germany bad schandau exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''rail travel'', issued in [[Bad Schandau]] at the Czech-German border before the [[Czech Republic]] joined the Schengen Area.\nFile:Poland korczowa exit.jpg|'''Exit stamp''' for ''road travel'', issued in [[Korczowa]] at the Polish-Ukrainian border.\nFile:Finland helsinki ferry.JPG|'''Exit stamp''' for ''ferry travel'', issued at the port of [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]].\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable outercollapse\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n!

Another example relates to third-country nationals who hold a residence permit issued by a [[Schengen Area#Membership|Schengen member state]] \u2014 when crossing the [[Schengen Area#Regulation of external borders|external border of the Schengen Area]], his/her travel document should not be stamped,<ref name=\"EUReport pp.6+9\"/> but when entering/leaving a French overseas department/collectivity, whilst he/she is not required to hold a visa for a short stay not exceeding 90 days in a 180-day period,<ref name=\"diplomatie.gouv.fr\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary |title = Requesting a visa}}</ref> his/her travel document will be stamped upon entry and exit.\n\nAnother exception applies in the case of the French overseas collectivity of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]]\u2014travellers who in principle are subject to the obligation to have their travel documents stamped but who have cleared immigration control in [[Sint Maarten]] will not have their passport stamped when they enter/leave the French side of [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]].<ref name=\"SaintMartinarrete\"/>\n\nThe design of passport stamps issued in the French overseas departments/collectivities differs from those issued in [[metropolitan France]]/the [[Schengen Area]].

He initially aspired for a professional career in football and entered the [[1995 NFL Draft]], but he went undrafted. As a result, Johnson signed with the [[Calgary Stampeders]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle of his first season. Shortly after, he began training as a professional wrestler.<ref>{{cite news |title=20 Surprising Facts About Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson |work=Hollywood.com |url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/things-you-didnt-know-about-the-rock-60361722/ |accessdate=August 27, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826193854/http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/things-you-didnt-know-about-the-rock-60361722/ |archivedate=August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Johnson secured a contract with the WWF and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of [[Rocky Johnson]] and grandson of [[Peter Maivia]].

[[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources.

Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|Lernaean Hydra}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnese|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].\n\n===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===\n{{Main|Hippolyta}}\n[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]\n[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).

They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years. During this time, he is sent to perform a series of difficult feats, called labours.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA253 p. 253].</ref>\n\n==Backstory==\n[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]\nDriven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|Lernaean Hydra}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnesians|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].\n\n===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===\n{{Main|Hippolyta}}\n[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]\n[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).
