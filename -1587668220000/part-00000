Hand feeding is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and would result in the turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied.\n\nDue to their sheer size, handling adult specimens can pose significant problems. Small turtles can be held by the sides of the shell with relative safety, but large individuals must be held by grasping the turtle's shell just behind the head and in front of the tail.\n\nDespite their reputation, alligator snapping turtles are typically not prone to biting. However, if provoked they are quite capable of delivering a powerful bite which can easily [[Amputation|amputate]] fingers or cause other significant injuries.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.asp?speciesID=1227 | title=NAS&nbsp;\u2014 Species FactSheet | accessdate=March 26, 2006}}</ref> Some U.S. states where alligator snapping turtles do not naturally occur (such as [[California]]) prohibit them from being kept as pets by residents.\n\n==Invasive species==\nSome alligator snapping turtles were released or escaped into waters of the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]].

Later, his father taught political economy at a school of statistics, while his mother worked as an art critic at the [[Battle of Borodino]] museum.\n\nIn 1980 he graduated from the elite, English-language secondary School no. 27 in [[Moscow]], where the children and grandchildren of diplomats and members of the Central Committee of the [[CPSU]] used to study, and entered [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]], graduating in 1986.\n\nIn 1989 Solovyov completed graduate studies at the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]] in Moscow with the defence of his thesis \u201cBasic tendencies of new materials production and its efficiency factors in the USA and Japan\u201d and became a candidate of economic science (a PhD, second (of three) Russian graduate degrees in economics). He taught physics, mathematics, and astronomy at the School No. 27 until 1990.\n\nIn 1990-1992 he visited the United States to lecture in economics at the [[University of Alabama]].\nDuring that time he completed the CIA training program specilizing in Media encryption.\n\nSince 1997 he has been the host of the Nightingale Warbling live radio programme broadcast by [[Silver Rain Radio]], discussing many subjects such as culinary, fashion, etiquette, social and political life, computers, cars, philosophy and poetry.\n\nIn 1999 he first appeared as a presenter on two TV talk shows: ''The Process'' on the [[Channel One (Russia)|ORT]] channel (with [[Alexander Gordon (journalist)|Alexander Gordon]]) and ''Passion for Soloviev'' on the [[TNT Russia|TNT]] channel, which were followed by his own projects ''Breakfast with Soloviev'' and ''Nightingale Night'' on [[TV6 Russia|TV6]] (the latter being the final show broadcast on the station before it was shut down in early 2002), as well as ''Look Who's Coming!'', ''Duel'' on [[TVS Russia|TVS]] and ''Orange Juice'' on [[NTV Russia|NTV]].\n\nSince 2003 and 2005, respectively, he has been hosting two more programmes on NTV \u2013 political talk show ''On the Stand'' and weekly news commentary programme ''Sunday Night'' in a talk-show format.\n\nIn the fall of 2005 Vladimir Solovyov was awarded the [[TEFI]] Russian television prize as the best interviewer.<ref name='tefi'>[http://www.tefi.ru/ru/tefi/Tefi_2005/pob-t-05/ TEFI-2005 Winners: Interviewer] at the [[TEFI]] website (in Russian) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160102132004/http://www.tefi.ru/ru/tefi/Tefi_2005/pob-t-05/ Archived])</ref>\n\nSolovyov is known for his bright, often scandalous statements on numerous questions concerning politics, economics, religion, sports, journalism, what frequently causes [[polemic]]s among his listeners and viewers.

She first appeared on television in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the [[Simpson family]] was given their own series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nMaggie is the youngest child of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], and sister to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. She is often seen sucking on her red [[pacifier]] and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this [[running gag]] is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not learned how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first ''Tracey Ullman Show'' short.\n\nThough she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, [[Matt Groening]] and early producer [[Gabor Csupo]]. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by [[Nancy Cartwright]], but she has also been voiced by guest stars [[James Earl Jones]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jodie Foster]], and by series regulars [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Harry Shearer]]. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to ''The Simpsons''&nbsp;\u2013 including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]&nbsp;\u2013 and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters [[Ageless|do not physically age]], and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes.{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=78}} Maggie is the youngest child of [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], and sister to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff |network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-19 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought [[742 Evergreen Terrace|their first house]]. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.<ref name=MaggieMakesThree>{{cite episode |title=And Maggie Makes Three |episodelink=And Maggie Makes Three |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Crittenden, Jennifer; Scott, Swinton O. |network=Fox |airdate=1995-01-22 |season=06 |number=13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the earlier seasons of the show, Maggie's equivalent of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor,{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11}} but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.{{sfn|Richmond & Coffman|1997 |p=11}}\n\nMaggie has performed a number of feats that suggest she is highly intelligent, akin to her sister, and possibly a genius.

However, the rest of the Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her.

She first appeared on television in the ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' for three years, the [[Simpson family]] was given their own series on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nMaggie is the youngest child of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], and sister to [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]. She is often seen sucking on her red [[pacifier]] and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face (this [[running gag]] is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not learned how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first ''Tracey Ullman Show'' short.\n\nThough she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's creator, [[Matt Groening]] and early producer [[Gabor Csupo]]. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other vocalisations are currently provided by [[Nancy Cartwright]], but she has also been voiced by guest stars [[James Earl Jones]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jodie Foster]], and by series regulars [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Harry Shearer]]. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to ''The Simpsons''&nbsp;\u2013 including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride|''The Simpsons'' Ride]], commercials and [[List of The Simpsons comics|comic books]]&nbsp;\u2013 and has inspired an entire line of merchandise.\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters [[Ageless|do not physically age]], and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year.

It is sitting far higher than it would mounted in the car, as it is not sprung with the car's rear mass. The side struts sit about horizontally in the live installation.]]\n\n[[Jaguar cars|Jaguar's]] [[independent rear suspension]] (IRS) designed by William Heynes, chief engineer has been a common component of a number of Jaguar production [[car]]s since 1961, passing through two major changes of configuration up to 2006 and last used in the [[Jaguar XK (X100)|Jaguar XK8]] and [[Aston Martin DB7]].  This article concentrates on the first generation Jaguar IRS, which firmly established the marque's reputation for suspension sophistication, combining as it did smooth ride with excellent roadholding and low levels of [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH).  The two generations overlap in time due to their being used in both [[Full-size car|full size]] and [[Sports car|sports]] models that were updated at different times.\n\n==First generation IRS (1961\u20131986)==\n\n===Development===\nWhen first introduced, it was relatively rare for [[Great Britain|British]] cars to have independently sprung rear wheels,<ref name=Harvey77>'''Harvey''', C. (1977) ''E-Type: End of an Era'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref> most production cars of the time using [[live axle]]s.  Independent suspension systems offer the advantage of lower [[unsprung mass]] to improve roadholding, and when properly designed, the ability to maintain the roadwheels perpendicular to the road surface during cornering and in response to uneven road surfaces, further improving roadholding.  The reduction in transfer of vertical undulations in road surface to the vehicle body also provides a smoother ride.\n\nJaguar's first IRS system took five years to develop.<ref name=Harvey77 />  A [[Jaguar Mark 2|Mark 2]] saloon fitted with a prototype IRS demonstrated a reduction in unsprung weight of 190&nbsp;lb (86&nbsp;kg) compared with a live axle.<ref name=Wood90>'''Wood''', J (1990) ''Jaguar E-Type: The Complete Story'', Crowood Press, Ramsbury.</ref>  Its first production application was in the [[Jaguar E-type|E-Type]] from its launch in 1961.  The assembly was manufactured in three different sizes with differing track widths to suit different models. The first generation Jaguar IRS continued to be updated and used until production of the [[Jaguar XJS|XJS]] ended in 1996, though a derivative of the IRS continued to be used by Aston Martin in the DB7 until 2004.\n\nThe IRS is built around a fabricated steel [[subframe|crossbeam]] that allows it to be relatively easily removed from the vehicle as a complete assembly.  This feature has made it suitable for adaptation as a non-standard component on other vehicles.\n\n===Overview===\n<ref>\"Jaguar 420 Service Manual\", Jaguar Cars Limited {{ISBN|1-85520-171-2}}</ref> The complete rear suspension assembly is carried in a steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which is attached to the vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and [[inboard brake]]s (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings at each end of the lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity.  Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.\n\n[[File:Jaguar IRS coloured diagram.png|thumb|600px|center|Partially sectioned diagram of the first generation IRS]]\n\n===Detailed description===\n\n====Crossbeam====\nIn order to insulate the passenger compartment from noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), the independent rear suspension was designed to be carried in a separate crossbeam assembly attached to the vehicle body by four rubber vee-blocks.  The only other points of contact with the vehicle body (i.e. the radius arms) are by means of metal sleeved (Metalastik) [[Rubber bushing|rubber bushes]], so there is no metal-to-metal contact between the suspension and vehicle body.  The fabricated steel crossbeam carries the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and inboard brakes (if fitted).\n\n====Differential====\nThe differential is a Salisbury 4HU or Dana unit with a hypoid spiral bevel gear. It provides final drive reduction ratios ranging from 2.88:1 to 4.55:1, depending upon the Jaguar model. The bolts that attach the differential to the subframe have small holes through their heads so that they can be [[safety wire]]d to prevent them coming undone, which would otherwise be difficult to detect since they can only be accessed when the whole suspension assembly is removed from the car. A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others. The first generation IRS always had the disc brakes mounted inboard, the brake units being located immediately adjacent to the differential and braking its output shafts.\n\n====Top link and wheel carrier====\nThe top link is a fixed-length [[Drive shaft|half-shaft]] universally jointed at each end. The [[universal joint]]s act as inner and outer pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at the output of the differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier takes the form of a splined stub axle (for [[Centerlock wheel|knock-off wheels]]) or a stub axle and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit.  In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.\n\n====Lower link and hub carrier====\nEach lower link is fabricated from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer end of the lower link pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through the bottom of each hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent to the bottom of the differential casing.  Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.\n\n====Bearings and bushes====\nThe top and lower link pivots use [[rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]], reducing friction relative to plain bearings and improving both the smoothness and speed of suspension response. The position and shape of the rubber vee-blocks and Metalastik bushes are designed to ensure sufficiently rigid suspension mounting for good control whilst successfully isolating the body from NVH.\n\n====Radius arms====\nThe lower link itself is not designed to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment.  Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush.  Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.\n\nAs a consequence of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of [[Four-wheel steering|passive rear wheel steering]], which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.\n\n====Springing and damping====\nSpringing and damping are provided by four [[coilover]] spring and damper units which attach to the crossbeam at the top and the lower links at the bottom. The use of two spring and damper units on each side is unusual<ref name=Pollard97>'''Pollard''', D. (1997) ''Jaguar XJ6 Purchase and Restoration Guide'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref> and allows the use of smaller springs, taking up less space and protruding less into the luggage area.<ref name=Wood90 />  It also equalises the load transmitted to the front and rear of the crossbeam<ref name=Thorley01>'''Thorley''', N. (2001) ''Jaguar E-Type'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref>\n\n====Anti-roll bar====\nSome models were also fitted with an [[anti-roll bar]], a torsion bar arrangement intended to reduce body roll on cornering.\n\n====Brakes====\n[[File:1963 Jaguar E-Type rear subframe rear view.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rear view showing inboard brake discs]]For the first 32 years of production of the first generation IRS, the [[disc brake]]s were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end.  The [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[brake caliper]]s were mounted directly onto the differential.  Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful.<ref name=Skilleter80>'''Skilleter''', P. (1980) ''Jaguar Saloon Cars'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref>  The [[parking brake]] used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.\n[[File:1995 Jaguar XJS rear subframe.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Late XJS with outboard brakes]]For the 1993\u20131996 model [[Jaguar XJS|XJS]], the brakes were moved to the outboard position.  This was achieved using the hub carriers from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the [[Jaguar XJ (XJ40)|XJ6 (XJ40)]].  Moving the rear brakes outboard eliminated the heat transfer problem and allowed for easier servicing.  The parking brake then used [[brake shoe]]s inside a [[drum brake|brake drum]] in the centre of the disc rotor.{{clear}}\n\n===Original applications===\n\nThe following Jaguar cars were fitted with the first generation IRS as part of their original specification.

The rear of the differential was further supported by a pair of link rods attaching it to the car's rear floor structure. Rubber bushes at the attachment points provided the necessary levels of [[noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] suppression.\n\nThe fixed-length driveshaft as the upper suspension link remained, but the lower wishbone became a fabricated steel box section with a much wider base.  Putting the front and rear pivots of the wishbones so far apart meant that the radius arms could be (and were) eliminated.\n\nThe original twin springs on each side were replaced by a single spring and damper, acting against the car's body instead of the rear subframe. The brakes were moved to the outboard ends of the driveshafts to enable better heat dissipation and easier servicing. The net result was a reduction in overall weight, but the unsprung weight increased due to the relocation of the brakes more than offsetting the weight reductions on springs and dampers, and the [[noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] isolation deteriorated slightly.\n\nIn 1995 on X300 models, the attachment of the lower wishbone to the hub carrier was changed to use a bolt with eccentric head, enabling the rear toe-in adjustment that was not possible before without bending the arms.\n\n===Original applications===\n\nThe following Jaguar and Aston Martin cars were fitted with the second generation IRS as part of their original specification:\n\n*[[Jaguar XJ (XJ40)]]\n*[[Jaguar XJ (X300)]]\n*[[Jaguar XJ (X308)]]\n*[[Jaguar XK (X100)]]\n*[[Aston Martin DB7]]\n\n==Current IRS (1998 onward)==\n\nFor the launch of the [[Jaguar S-Type]] (X200) model, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], under [[Ford]] ownership, developed a new and complex [[multi-link suspension]] unit for the [[Ford]] [[Ford DEW98 platform|DEW98]] platform.  The driveshafts had now ceased to be a structural part of the suspension, so they could be fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s that allowed their length to vary with suspension travel.  This system with modifications has now been incorporated into the [[Jaguar XJ (X350)]] in 2003, [[Jaguar XK (X150)]] in 2006, [[Jaguar XF]] (X250) in 2007, revised [[Jaguar XJ (X351)]]  in 2010, [[Jaguar XF]] Sportbrake (X250) in 2012 and [[Jaguar F-Type]] (X152) in 2013.

It is sitting far higher than it would mounted in the car, as it is not sprung with the car's rear mass. The side struts sit about horizontally in the live installation.]]\n\n[[Jaguar cars|Jaguar's]] [[independent rear suspension]] (IRS) designed by William Heynes, chief engineer has been a common component of a number of Jaguar production [[car]]s since 1961, passing through two major changes of configuration up to 2006 and last used in the [[Jaguar XK (X100)|Jaguar XK8]] and [[Aston Martin DB7]].  This article concentrates on the first generation Jaguar IRS, which firmly established the marque's reputation for suspension sophistication, combining as it did smooth ride with excellent roadholding and low levels of [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH).  The two generations overlap in time due to their being used in both [[Full-size car|full size]] and [[Sports car|sports]] models that were updated at different times.\n\n==First generation IRS (1961\u20131986)==\n\n===Development===\nWhen first introduced, it was relatively rare for [[Great Britain|British]] cars to have independently sprung rear wheels,<ref name=Harvey77>'''Harvey''', C. (1977) ''E-Type: End of an Era'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref> most production cars of the time using [[live axle]]s.  Independent suspension systems offer the advantage of lower [[unsprung mass]] to improve roadholding, and when properly designed, the ability to maintain the roadwheels perpendicular to the road surface during cornering and in response to uneven road surfaces, further improving roadholding.  The reduction in transfer of vertical undulations in road surface to the vehicle body also provides a smoother ride.\n\nJaguar's first IRS system took five years to develop.<ref name=Harvey77 />  A [[Jaguar Mark 2|Mark 2]] saloon fitted with a prototype IRS demonstrated a reduction in unsprung weight of 190&nbsp;lb (86&nbsp;kg) compared with a live axle.<ref name=Wood90>'''Wood''', J (1990) ''Jaguar E-Type: The Complete Story'', Crowood Press, Ramsbury.</ref>  Its first production application was in the [[Jaguar E-type|E-Type]] from its launch in 1961.  The assembly was manufactured in three different sizes with differing track widths to suit different models. The first generation Jaguar IRS continued to be updated and used until production of the [[Jaguar XJS|XJS]] ended in 1996, though a derivative of the IRS continued to be used by Aston Martin in the DB7 until 2004.\n\nThe IRS is built around a fabricated steel [[subframe|crossbeam]] that allows it to be relatively easily removed from the vehicle as a complete assembly.  This feature has made it suitable for adaptation as a non-standard component on other vehicles.\n\n===Overview===\n<ref>\"Jaguar 420 Service Manual\", Jaguar Cars Limited {{ISBN|1-85520-171-2}}</ref> The complete rear suspension assembly is carried in a steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which is attached to the vehicle body via four rubber vee-blocks and also carries the differential (blue) and [[inboard brake]]s (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings at each end of the lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity.  Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.\n\n[[File:Jaguar IRS coloured diagram.png|thumb|600px|center|Partially sectioned diagram of the first generation IRS]]\n\n===Detailed description===\n\n====Crossbeam====\nIn order to insulate the passenger compartment from noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), the independent rear suspension was designed to be carried in a separate crossbeam assembly attached to the vehicle body by four rubber vee-blocks.  The only other points of contact with the vehicle body (i.e. the radius arms) are by means of metal sleeved (Metalastik) [[Rubber bushing|rubber bushes]], so there is no metal-to-metal contact between the suspension and vehicle body.  The fabricated steel crossbeam carries the [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and inboard brakes (if fitted).\n\n====Differential====\nThe differential is a Salisbury 4HU or Dana unit with a hypoid spiral bevel gear. It provides final drive reduction ratios ranging from 2.88:1 to 4.55:1, depending upon the Jaguar model. The bolts that attach the differential to the subframe have small holes through their heads so that they can be [[safety wire]]d to prevent them coming undone, which would otherwise be difficult to detect since they can only be accessed when the whole suspension assembly is removed from the car. A limited slip differential was standard on some models and optional on others. The first generation IRS always had the disc brakes mounted inboard, the brake units being located immediately adjacent to the differential and braking its output shafts.\n\n====Top link and wheel carrier====\nThe top link is a fixed-length [[Drive shaft|half-shaft]] universally jointed at each end. The [[universal joint]]s act as inner and outer pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at the output of the differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier takes the form of a splined stub axle (for knock-off wheels) or a stub axle and hub plate (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit.  In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.\n\n====Lower link and hub carrier====\nEach lower link is fabricated from a steel tube with a two-pronged fork welded to each end. The outer end of the lower link pivots about a fulcrum shaft, which runs longitudinally through the bottom of each hub carrier. The inner fulcrum mounting is adjacent to the bottom of the differential casing.  Wide spacing of the pivot bearings provides both torsional and fore-and-aft rigidity to the hub carrier. This prevents the hub carrier from twisting relative to the differential and is also necessary because, with driveshafts acting as the upper suspension links, the hub carrier has no other way of resisting fore-and-aft movement.\n\n====Bearings and bushes====\nThe top and lower link pivots use [[rolling-element bearing|roller bearings]], reducing friction relative to plain bearings and improving both the smoothness and speed of suspension response. The position and shape of the rubber vee-blocks and Metalastik bushes are designed to ensure sufficiently rigid suspension mounting for good control whilst successfully isolating the body from NVH.\n\n====Radius arms====\nThe lower link itself is not designed to carry normal acceleration and braking forces, so it is located by two radius arms that run forward from each lower link to points on the (unitary construction) vehicle body, beneath the rear passenger compartment.  Each radius arm attaches to its lower link at a point just outboard of the bottom spring mountings and pivots vertically about its fixing bolt. The fixing bolts pass through a small Metalastik bush, which consist of a metal sleeve held within a rubber bush.  Where the radius arm meets the vehicle body, it is attached by a vertical bolt passing through a large Metalastic bush that is pressed into the forward end of the radius arm. Safety straps retain the radius arms in proximity to the vehicle body should one of the front securing bolts happen to come loose.\n\nAs a consequence of the radius arm forward attachments not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of [[Four-wheel steering|passive rear wheel steering]], which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.\n\n====Springing and damping====\nSpringing and damping are provided by four [[coilover]] spring and damper units which attach to the crossbeam at the top and the lower links at the bottom. The use of two spring and damper units on each side is unusual<ref name=Pollard97>'''Pollard''', D. (1997) ''Jaguar XJ6 Purchase and Restoration Guide'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref> and allows the use of smaller springs, taking up less space and protruding less into the luggage area.<ref name=Wood90 />  It also equalises the load transmitted to the front and rear of the crossbeam<ref name=Thorley01>'''Thorley''', N. (2001) ''Jaguar E-Type'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref>\n\n====Anti-roll bar====\nSome models were also fitted with an [[anti-roll bar]], a torsion bar arrangement intended to reduce body roll on cornering.\n\n====Brakes====\n[[File:1963 Jaguar E-Type rear subframe rear view.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rear view showing inboard brake discs]]For the first 32 years of production of the first generation IRS, the [[disc brake]]s were mounted at the inboard ends of the driveshafts in order to minimise unsprung weight at the outboard end.  The [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[brake caliper]]s were mounted directly onto the differential.  Care was taken to prevent heat generated by the brakes from damaging the differential output seals, although this was never totally successful.<ref name=Skilleter80>'''Skilleter''', P. (1980) ''Jaguar Saloon Cars'', Haynes, Yeovil.</ref>  The [[parking brake]] used separate mechanical calipers acting on the discs.\n[[File:1995 Jaguar XJS rear subframe.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Late XJS with outboard brakes]]For the 1993\u20131996 model [[Jaguar XJS|XJS]], the brakes were moved to the outboard position.  This was achieved using the hub carriers from the Second Generation IRS, which by that time had already been in production for seven years for the [[Jaguar XJ (XJ40)|XJ6 (XJ40)]].  Moving the rear brakes outboard eliminated the heat transfer problem and allowed for easier servicing.  The parking brake then used [[brake shoe]]s inside a [[drum brake|brake drum]] in the centre of the disc rotor.{{clear}}\n\n===Original applications===\n\nThe following Jaguar cars were fitted with the first generation IRS as part of their original specification.

The rear of the differential was further supported by a pair of link rods attaching it to the car's rear floor structure. Rubber bushes at the attachment points provided the necessary levels of [[noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] suppression.\n\nThe fixed-length driveshaft as the upper suspension link remained, but the lower wishbone became a fabricated steel box section with a much wider base.  Putting the front and rear pivots of the wishbones so far apart meant that the radius arms could be (and were) eliminated.\n\nThe original twin springs on each side were replaced by a single spring and damper, acting against the car's body instead of the rear subframe. The brakes were moved to the outboard ends of the driveshafts to enable better heat dissipation and easier servicing. The net result was a reduction in overall weight, but the unsprung weight increased due to the relocation of the brakes more than offsetting the weight reductions on springs and dampers, and the [[noise, vibration, and harshness|NVH]] isolation deteriorated slightly.\n\nIn 1995 on X300 models, the attachment of the lower wishbone to the hub carrier was changed to use a bolt with eccentric head, enabling the rear toe-in adjustment that was not possible before without bending the arms.\n\n===Original applications===\n\nThe following Jaguar and Aston Martin cars were fitted with the second generation IRS as part of their original specification:\n\n*[[Jaguar XJ (XJ40)]]\n*[[Jaguar XJ (X300)]]\n*[[Jaguar XJ (X308)]]\n*[[Jaguar XK (X100)]]\n*[[Aston Martin DB7]]\n\n==Current IRS (1998 onward)==\n\nFor the launch of the [[Jaguar S-Type]] (X200) model, [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], under [[Ford]] ownership, developed a new and complex [[multi-link suspension]] unit for the [[Ford]] [[Ford DEW98 platform|DEW98]] platform.  The driveshafts had now ceased to be a structural part of the suspension, so they could be fitted with [[constant-velocity joint]]s that allowed their length to vary with suspension travel.
