He has kidnapped dozens of school girls and plans to use them as suicide bombers to bomb populated areas in India. He even puts some girls into the personal harem, pushing the remaining ones into prostitution and trafficks their limbs and organs for money. He is also responsible for murdering the chief of Indian army, General Sinha (Parikshit Sahani). One day, while out for a seaside trip with his daughter, Major Krishna Rao, an officer in the Indian Army, happens to notice an island with his daughter and they find a schoolgirl escaping someone. they try to take her on the boat, but she dies. Then leaving Dolly with his trusted servant, Major Rao himself creeps forward and sees Dong ordering his men to do away with those kids. He calls Dong a clown and other names, and overpowers him, though getting a bullet in his arm in the process. Making all the girls board the two boats, he takes Dong, tied up on board, but then Dong's men come and having kidnapped Dolly, they free Dong from the chamber. Dong warns major Rao to come to Dongrila and rescue his daughter within the next year i.e., 12 months from that very day. He chants an eerie verse and cuts off one of Krishna Rao's legs, thus making him handicapped.\n\nKrishna Rao recruits the best Indian army officers Captain Ranvir ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), Captain Rakesh ([[Aditya Pancholi]]), Captain Javed ([[Javed Jaffrey]]), Captain Anju (Ekta Sohini) and former disgraced Major Dharam Singh ([[Dharmendra]]). Then he somehow makes Shammi Kapoor, the second senior general and Mr. Iyer, the committee chairman agree to his plan. They agree on the condition that Krishna' team's victory would be a national victory, but their defeat will be a personal issue. Then Krishna Rao's team starts their journey and they go on a perilous journey between the borders of China and India to rescue Dolly as well as dozens of school girls held in Dong's captivity and destroy Dong's kingdom of Dongrila.\n\nWhile the force five leaves, Major Kapoor is seen betraying their locations to Capt. Synthia, who works for General Dong. Allah Rakha catches Kapoor red handed and reprimands him severely. He expresses his regret that an Indian himself is selling the nation to the enemies. While Allah Rakha tries to finish Kapoor, the latter deceitfully shoots him with a pistol through his blazer pocket and kills him, thus wiping out the first crucial witness.\n\nIn their journey, they are helped by Jenny, wife of Dongrila's ex-army chief Mr D'Costa, Prince Couv and Julie. It so happens that in the big city hospital, Major Rao contracts gangrene in his left leg and needs to be operated on. But Dong's men surround the hospital and shooting begins. They even cut off the electrical supply so the team decides to obtain a generator from the base room. Rakesh says that they shall have to capture the whole area after killing all these soldiers. Just then Krishna comes there and says that they've already endangered the mission. He asks them to escape by going down a valley that Anju discovered on the other side of the hospital. Dharam Singh says that he will complete the mission here itself and asks major Rao to behave like a commander. But Major Rao chooses him as the next commander and makes him promise to lead the team for making the mission a success. All of them start climbing down the valley as Major Rao gathers all the guns and starts fighting alone. As the team reaches the foot of the valley, Dong's men blast the hospital acting by his orders and by sheer misfortune, Major Rao loses his life in fighting the Dong's Army. Another blow strikes when Julie's brother captain Jello kills the little son of Mrs. D'costa as he catches the child spying on them. It is revealed that the little boy was helping Prince Couv. It is found out that Julie is an informer of Dong's Captain Cynthia. Her identity is disclosed and she is killed by Captain Ranvir. Then, in retaliation, Dong gives execution orders for Cynthia. But, Cynthia is saved by Javed and Rakesh, who is then offered to switch sides. Then, they all attack Dong and kill him. But, lastly Brigadier Kapoor attacks the team and reveals himself as an informer of Dong. But, he is cleverly killed by Major Dharam Singh, saying the famous dialogue of the movie ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', \"If you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dharmendra]] as Major Dharam Singh\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as Captain Ranvir\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as General Dong \n* [[Shammi Kapoor]] as Brigadier Kapoor\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Major Krishna Rao\n* [[Pallavi Joshi]] as Julie\n* [[Aditya Pancholi]] as Captain Rakesh\n* [[Ekta Sohini]] as Captain Anju Sinha\n* [[Javed Jaffrey]] as Captain Javed\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Intelligence Chief Cynthia\n* [[Dilip Dhawan]] as Captain Wilson D'Costa\n* [[Sonu Walia]] as Jenny D' Costa  \n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Prince Kow\n* [[Gulshan Grover]] as Orderly Allah Rakha\n* [[Sudhir (Hindi actor)]] as Dong's Right Hand\n* [[Tom Alter]]\tas Dong's army captain\n* [[Bob Christo]] as Dong's Henchman\t\t\n* [[Dan Dhanoa]] as Jelu (Julie's Brother)\n* [[Jack Gaud]]\tas Dong's Army Capt.

Located on the eastern edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], it is the source of drinking water for two million people, and is the primary water supply for agriculture and industry in the aquifer's region. In addition, the Edwards Aquifer feeds the [[Comal River|Comal]] and [[San Marcos Springs|San Marcos springs]], provides springflow for recreational and downstream uses in the [[Nueces River|Nueces]], [[San Antonio River|San Antonio]], [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe]], and [[San Marcos River|San Marcos]] river basins, and is home to several unique and endangered species.\n\n== Water balance ==\nAlthough between 25 and 55 million acre-feet of water may be present in the Edwards aquifer, only a small portion of this water is practically or legally available for use.<ref name=\":7\" /> Storage is the difference between recharge (inputs) and discharge (outputs) from the Edwards Aquifer.\n\nAnnual storage can be negative during dry years with high water use and positive during wet years with relatively low water use. A long-term negative imbalance between recharge and discharge in an aquifer may lead to the depletion of the available water in the aquifer.\n\nAnnual storage between 1955 and 2012 estimated from data provided by a continuing program between the U.S. Geologic Survey and the Edwards Aquifer Authority ranged from -633,000 to +1,653,000 acre-feet per year. The average storage during this period was 37,000 acre-feet per year.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n[[File:Edwards Aquifer Water Balance 1955-2012.png|thumb|526x526px|Water inputs, outputs, and storage to the Edwards Aquifer based on data collected by the Edwards Aquifer Authority between 1955 and 2012]]\n  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|}\n\n=== Inputs (recharge) ===\nWater enters the Edwards Aquifer in two ways: it either falls as precipitation and percolates directly into the aquifer, or it enters as streamflow flowing through the Recharge Zone.  The Recharge Zone occurs along the Balcones Fault Zone where the Edwards Plateau drops steeply and meets the Gulf Coastal Plain. Here, highly fractured limestones are exposed at the Earth's surface, which allow rain and streamflow to infiltrate directly into the aquifer.<ref>Ogden, A. E., Quick, R. A., Rothermel (1986).

The Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have monitored annual well and spring discharges since 1934.\n\nAnnual well discharge - the sum of all well discharges in a year - ranged from 219,300 acre-feet to 542,500 acre-feet between 1955 and 2012. The average well discharge for this period was approximately 371,667 acre-feet, equivalent to 183 thousand Olympic-sized swimming pools.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAnnual spring discharge ranged from 69,800 acre-feet to 802,800 acre-feet between 1955 and 2012.

These are used to estimate the sustainable levels of groundwater withdrawal throughout the aquifer.<ref>Bredehoeft, J. 2002. The Water Budget Myth Revisited: Why Hydrogeologist Model. Groundwater, 40 (4), 340-345.</ref> Given ample data is needed for numerical simulations, yet often lacking,<ref>Zhou, Y., Li, W. 2011. A review of regional groundwater flow modeling. Geoscience Frontiers, 2 (2), 205-214.</ref> regional modeling of large aquifers is difficult, but modeling segments within an aquifer is common and provides useful information for water users throughout the aquifer.\n\nAquifer storage is correlated with water levels recorded in the J-17 Bexar [[Monitoring wells|index well]] which serves as the sole official monitoring well in the Edwards Aquifer.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":21\" /> The J-17 well, is located in the artisanal confined Edwards Aquifer at a location AY-68-37-203 based on the latitude and longitude.<ref name=\":21\" /> Water levels have been recorded in the J-17 well since the 1910s, and is used to generalize the entire aquifer system.  Changes in aquifer storage are used to estimate recharge rates.\n\nIn the Edwards aquifer, groundwater flow models have been developed for the San Antonio and Barton Springs aquifer segments in the San Antonio region of Texas. Two model simulations were conducted: steady state and transient. A steady-state groundwater flow model requires magnitude and direction of flow remain constant, whereas a transient model simulation allows for a change in water storage over time. Steady-state results suggest water leaving the aquifer occurs through springs (73.3 percent), water well pumping (25.7 percent), and to the Colorado River (0.6 percent). Inflow of water to the aquifer mostly occurs through natural recharge (93.5 percent) and water delivered through the aquifer's regional boundaries (6.5 percent). The transient simulation model also suggests discharge primarily occurs through springs, followed by water well pumping; however, changes in water storage is heavily dependent upon the amount of monthly precipitation and water well pumping volumes.<ref>Lindgren, R., Dutton, A., Hovorka, S., Worthington, S.

The main geologic unit, known as the Edwards [[Limestone]], is tilted downward toward the south and east and is overlain by younger limestone layers as well as several thousand feet of sediments. The Edwards Aquifer is a group of limestones and is considered a highly heterogenic [[aquifer]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hydrogeology of the Edwards Aquifer|url = http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/geology.html|website = www.edwardsaquifer.net|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref> Three stratigraphic columns across the San Antonio area represent the Edwards Aquifer.

The initial requirements of the groundwater management plans were that they address the efficient use of groundwater, methods of controlling and preventing waste of groundwater, conjunctive surface water issues, natural resource issues that affect the use and availability, of groundwater, and methods of controlling and preventing subsidence.\n\nThe requirements of groundwater management plans have since been expanded to require the inclusion of planning requirements for addressing drought conditions and conservation(2001, the 77th Texas Legislature Senate Bill 2), estimates of the managed available groundwater, the amount of groundwater used within each district, the amount of recharge from precipitation, projected surface water supply, total water demand within the district, and consideration of water management strategies that were included in the adopted state water plan( 2005, 79th Texas Legislature HB 1763). Senate Bill 2 of the 77th Texas Legislature also required the groundwater conservation districts to submit groundwater management plans to the Chair of any Regional Water Planning Group in which any part of the district is located so that they may specify any area(s) that conflict with the approved Regional Water Plan[1].\n\nIn addition to the groundwater management plan, the Edwards Aquifer Authority board of directors maintains a three-year rolling strategic plan that is updated annually. The 2015-2017 strategic plan adopted on October 14, 2014 identifies six major goals:\n* Goal A: Sustain Federally Protected Aquifer-Dependent Species\n* Goal B: Ensure Effective Management of the Edwards Aquifer\n* Goal C: Enhance Recharge Program for Improved Aquifer Management and Springflow Maintenance,\n* Goal D: Prevent the Pollution of the Aquifer\n* Goal E: Conduct Research that Enhances Understanding and Effective Management of the Aquifer\n* Goal F: Develop a Diverse, Service-Oriented Organization\n* Goal G: Build Shared Value in the EAA Mission\n* Goal H:  Sustain Fiscal Stability [3]\nWith the growth of regional\ncities such as San Antonio, municipal demand for water increased.<ref>''Rattan Lal, B.A. Stewart, ed.

Located on the eastern edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], it is the source of drinking water for two million people, and is the primary water supply for agriculture and industry in the aquifer's region. In addition, the Edwards Aquifer feeds the [[Comal River|Comal]] and [[San Marcos Springs|San Marcos springs]], provides springflow for recreational and downstream uses in the [[Nueces River|Nueces]], [[San Antonio River|San Antonio]], [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe]], and [[San Marcos River|San Marcos]] river basins, and is home to several unique and endangered species.\n\n== Water balance ==\nAlthough between 25 and 55 million acre-feet of water may be present in the Edwards aquifer, only a small portion of this water is practically or legally available for use.<ref name=\":7\" /> Storage is the difference between recharge (inputs) and discharge (outputs) from the Edwards Aquifer.\n\nAnnual storage can be negative during dry years with high water use and positive during wet years with relatively low water use. A long-term negative imbalance between recharge and discharge in an aquifer may lead to the depletion of the available water in the aquifer.\n\nAnnual storage between 1955 and 2012 estimated from data provided by a continuing program between the U.S. Geologic Survey and the Edwards Aquifer Authority ranged from -633,000 to +1,653,000 acre-feet per year.

The Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have monitored annual well and spring discharges since 1934.\n\nAnnual well discharge - the sum of all well discharges in a year - ranged from 219,300 acre-feet to 542,500 acre-feet between 1955 and 2012.

These are used to estimate the sustainable levels of groundwater withdrawal throughout the aquifer.<ref>Bredehoeft, J. 2002. The Water Budget Myth Revisited: Why Hydrogeologist Model. Groundwater, 40 (4), 340-345.</ref> Given ample data is needed for numerical simulations, yet often lacking,<ref>Zhou, Y., Li, W. 2011. A review of regional groundwater flow modeling. Geoscience Frontiers, 2 (2), 205-214.</ref> regional modeling of large aquifers is difficult, but modeling segments within an aquifer is common and provides useful information for water users throughout the aquifer.\n\nAquifer storage is correlated with water levels recorded in the J-17 Bexar [[Monitoring wells|index well]] which serves as the sole official monitoring well in the Edwards Aquifer.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":21\" /> The J-17 well, is located in the artisanal confined Edwards Aquifer at a location AY-68-37-203 based on the latitude and longitude.<ref name=\":21\" /> Water levels have been recorded in the J-17 well since the 1910s, and is used to generalize the entire aquifer system.  Changes in aquifer storage are used to estimate recharge rates.\n\nIn the Edwards aquifer, groundwater flow models have been developed for the San Antonio and Barton Springs aquifer segments in the San Antonio region of Texas. Two model simulations were conducted: steady state and transient. A steady-state groundwater flow model requires magnitude and direction of flow remain constant, whereas a transient model simulation allows for a change in water storage over time. Steady-state results suggest water leaving the aquifer occurs through springs (73.3 percent), water well pumping (25.7 percent), and to the Colorado River (0.6 percent). Inflow of water to the aquifer mostly occurs through natural recharge (93.5 percent) and water delivered through the aquifer's regional boundaries (6.5 percent). The transient simulation model also suggests discharge primarily occurs through springs, followed by water well pumping; however, changes in water storage is heavily dependent upon the amount of monthly precipitation and water well pumping volumes.<ref>Lindgren, R., Dutton, A., Hovorka, S., Worthington, S.

The initial requirements of the groundwater management plans were that they address the efficient use of groundwater, methods of controlling and preventing waste of groundwater, conjunctive surface water issues, natural resource issues that affect the use and availability, of groundwater, and methods of controlling and preventing subsidence.\n\nThe requirements of groundwater management plans have since been expanded to require the inclusion of planning requirements for addressing drought conditions and conservation(2001, the 77th Texas Legislature Senate Bill 2), estimates of the managed available groundwater, the amount of groundwater used within each district, the amount of recharge from precipitation, projected surface water supply, total water demand within the district, and consideration of water management strategies that were included in the adopted state water plan( 2005, 79th Texas Legislature HB 1763). Senate Bill 2 of the 77th Texas Legislature also required the groundwater conservation districts to submit groundwater management plans to the Chair of any Regional Water Planning Group in which any part of the district is located so that they may specify any area(s) that conflict with the approved Regional Water Plan[1].\n\nIn addition to the groundwater management plan, the Edwards Aquifer Authority board of directors maintains a three-year rolling strategic plan that is updated annually. The 2015-2017 strategic plan adopted on October 14, 2014 identifies six major goals:\n* Goal A: Sustain Federally Protected Aquifer-Dependent Species\n* Goal B: Ensure Effective Management of the Edwards Aquifer\n* Goal C: Enhance Recharge Program for Improved Aquifer Management and Springflow Maintenance,\n* Goal D: Prevent the Pollution of the Aquifer\n* Goal E: Conduct Research that Enhances Understanding and Effective Management of the Aquifer\n* Goal F: Develop a Diverse, Service-Oriented Organization\n* Goal G: Build Shared Value in the EAA Mission\n* Goal H:  Sustain Fiscal Stability [3]\nWith the growth of regional\ncities such as San Antonio, municipal demand for water increased.<ref>''Rattan Lal, B.A. Stewart, ed.

In an effort to protect the ratepayer (i.e. San Antonio citizens), the project proposes an undetermined lifeline rate.

HCP project examples include minimization and mitigation of the impacts of low flow, by restoring native riparian zones in order to benefit the Comal Springs riffle beetle by increasing the amount functional habitat and food sources (i.e., root structures and associated biofilms).<ref name=\":18\">\"Habitat Protection Measures.\" EAHCP \u2014 Restoration of Riparian Zones and Riffle BeetleRiparian Improvement.

However, Burri\u2019s artistic production flowed definitively into abstract forms before the end of the same year, the use of small format [[tempera]] resulting from the influence of such artists as [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], whose studio was visited by Burri during a trip to Paris in the winter of 1948.<ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. p. 37</ref>\n\n==== Tars, Molds, Hunchbacks ====\nBurri's artistic research became personal in short time, between 1948 and 1950 he began experimenting with using unusual, 'unorthodox' materials such as [[tar]], [[sand]], [[zinc]], [[pumice]], and [[Aluminium]] dust as well as [[Polyvinyl chloride]] glue, this last material being elevated to the same importance as oil colors. During this artistic transition, the painter showed his sensitivity to the mixed-media type of abstraction of [[Enrico Prampolini]], a central figure in Italian [[Abstract art]]. Nonetheless Burri went one step further in his ''Catrami'' (Tars), presenting tar not as a simple [[collage]] material, but as an actual color which \u2013 by way of different lucid and opaque shades in monochrome black\u2013, blended itself with the totality of the painting.<ref>Brandi, Cesare (1963). ''Burri''. Rome: Editalia. p.22: \u201c''Burri did not begins with collage: the first pictures of '48 are all paintings. But in the earliest of them, the first Nero (Black) one, with a little blue square (and round and oval elements), the passage from shiny to opaque black acts not as a color but as material, like the right and wrong sides of a piece of satin''.\u201d</ref><ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015).

In some artworks of the same period which he called ''Gobbi'' (Hunchbacks), Burri focused on the painting\u2019s spatial interaction, achieving another original outcome due to the incorporation of tree branches on the rear of the canvas which pushed two-dimensionality towards [[Three-dimensional space]].<ref name=\":1\">Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

In a word, matter became the subject''.\"</ref>\n\nThe formal artistic elegance and the spatial balances obtained through aeroform steams, craters, rips, overlapping color layers and different forms, differentiated Burri\u2019s art, founded on attentive reflections and precise calculations, from the impulsive gestures that characterized [[Action painting]] during the same period.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2016). \"Burri, de Kooning, Pollock: Parallel Convergences\".

''Alberto Burri A retrospective view 1948\u20131977.'' Los Angeles: Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery Editions.

The best known application of this procedure was reached in the ''Plastiche'' (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri's art showed up in Italy as well.\n\nThe blowtorch was only apparently a destructive device. Indeed, the craters modeled by the flame on cellophane, black, red or transparent plastic or on the ''Bianchi Plastica'' (White Plastic) series, in which the transparent plastic is laid on a white or black support, were lightly directed by the painter's blowing. The balances of the matter were thus highlighted once again, in a sort of 'defiance' towards of flame's randomness on the one hand, and in a sort of attempt to 'dominate chance', intrinsic to Burri's philosophy, on the other.<ref>Pirovano, Carlo (1996). \"The Seasons of Fire\".

In Melandri, Luisa, with Duncan, Michael. ''Combustione, Alberto Burri and America''. Los Angeles: Santa Monica Museum of Art. Exhibition catalogue. p. 22</ref> During his recurrent trips to [[Death Valley National Park]], the artist found in the natural cracking of the desert the visual spur which led him, starting from 1973, to create ''Cretti'' (Cracks) developing the use of the crackled paint effect of his 1940's artworks.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). Ibidem. p. 23: \"''The noun 'cretto' \u2013 from the verb crettare in rare old Tuscan Italian \u2013 refers to small cracks that appear in plaster walls. The wod was originally most often used to describe the cracks that might appear in the 'intonaco' of a fresco. The term is therefore not only descriptive but links Burri\u2019s works to the mural traditions of his native Italy \u2013 and to Renaissance art-making''.\"</ref>\n\nEmploying a special mixture of kaolin, resins and pigment, the painter dried its surface with the heat of an oven. Burri arrested the heating process at the desired moment using a PVA glue layer, thus obtaining greater and lesser cracking effects, which were always balanced thanks to the painter's extensive knowledge of chemistry.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2015): \"Alberto Burri: His Cretti (Cracks) and Their Roots in the History of Art\".

It is one of the largest works of art ever realized, extending over an area of approximately 85,000 square meters. Its white concrete covering expands over the town, following the old street map in long arterial roads and corridors, which are walkable, thus symbolically bringing the devastated town back to life.\n\n==== Cellotex and the large cycles of paintings ====\nDuring the Seventies Burri's art saw a gradual transition towards wider dimensions, while retrospectives followed one another around the world. The great solo exhibition crossing the United States in 1977\u201378 and ending at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York is one example.\n\nIn the 1979 cycle of paintings called ''Il Viaggio'' (The Journey) Burri retraced, through ten monumental compositions, the key moments of his artistic production.<ref>The artist polemically excluded the ''Sacchi'', which many critics were considering his major works, to emancipate his production from the \u2018''lazy crystallization of his expressive message''\u2019 (Pirovano, Carlo. 2015. \"Burri, the Investigation of Space\".

An example is the recurrent motif of the [[archivolt]], viewed in its plain form in painting and in perspective in such iron sculptures as ''Teatro Scultura'' \u2013 a work presented at 1984 Venice Biennale \u2013, and in the 1972 [[Ogive]] series in ''[[ceramics]]''.<ref>Duranti, Massimo (2011).\"From form to matter, to abstract form: the development of Alberto Burri\u2019s aesthetic devolution\".

Other sculptures on iron are permanently held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello museums, Ravenna, Celle (Pistoia), Perugia and Milan, where the rotating wings of the ''Teatro Continuo'' (Continuous Theatre) is both real scenic space and sculpture, employing the [[Sforza Castle]] park as natural backcloth.<ref>The work was built on the occasion of the 1973 Milan Triennale, then demolished in 1989 by the municipality.

''Il Teatro Continuo di Alberto Burri''. Mantova: Corraini. Italian/English. {{ISBN|9788875705091}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre sets ===\nTheater had a privileged role in Burri's artistic production. Though in isolated interventions, the painter worked in the fields of prose, ballet and opera. In 1963 Burri designed the sets for ''Spirituals'', [[Morton Gould]]'s ballet at [[La Scala]], in Milan. The painter's ''Plastiche'' emphasized the dramatic force of such plays as the 1969 [[Ignazio Silone]] stage adaptation in San Miniato (Pisa) and [[Tristan and Iseult]], performed in 1975 at the Teatro Regio in Turin.\n\nIn 1973 Burri designed sets and costumes for ''November Steps'', conceived by his wife Minsa Craig, with a score by [[Toru Takemitsu]]. The ballet was interacting with an early example of visual art by a film clip depicting how the ''Cretti'' progressively came into being.\n\n== Graphic work ==\nBurri never considered graphic art of secondary importance to painting. He participated intensively in the experimentation of new printing techniques as the 1965 reproduction of the ''Combustioni'' \u2013 in which the brothers Valter and Eleonora Rossi perfectly succeeded in mimicking the effect of burning on paper \u2013, or the irregular ''Cretti'' cavities (1971) with the same printers.\n\nFurther innovative developments can be found in the silk screens ''Sestante'' (1987\u201389) \u2013 with the help of Burri's old friend and collaborator [[Nuvolo]] \u2013 to the ''Mixoblack'' series (1988), created in Los Angeles with printers Luis and Lea Remba on marble dust and sand in particular three-dimensional effects.<ref>Sarteanesi, Chiara (2015). \"Tradition and Innovation in Alberto Burri\u2019s Graphic Art\".

Guggenheim Museum]] and to the 2016 collective exhibition ''Burri Lo spazio di Materia tra Europa e USA'' edited by the current Foundation chairman Bruno Cor\u00e0, which foregrounded the radical change in traditional Western painting and modern collage brought about by Burri, while also focusing on his 'psychological' recovery of classical painting's formal balances alive.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alberto Burri: The Allure of Trauma |url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/alberto-burri-allure-trauma/3308 |website=Whitehot Magazine of Contemporary Art |accessdate=22 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAmong the many historical readings, [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]'s judgment (written in the 1960 [[Venice Biennale]] catalogue) remains emblematic: \"''For Burri we must speak for an overturned [[Trompe-l'\u0153il]], because it is no more painting to simulate reality, but it is reality to simulate painting''.\"<ref>Argan, Giulio Carlo (1960).

Brin and her husband, Gaspero del Corso founded the Obelisco Gallery, the first art gallery to open in Postwar Rome, featuring the 1952 solo exhibition ''Muffe e Neri'' (Molds and Blacks) and the first ''Combustions'' in 1957. The Burri's first exhibition with the ''Sacchi'' was presented by the poet [[Emilio Villa]] at the Origine Foundation in 1952, in confirmation of his increasingly original production. The ''Ferri'' (Irons) were held at Galleria Blu in Milan.\n\nFrom 1953 on, Burri regularly exhibited his works in the United States, at the Allan Frumkin Gallery (Chicago), the [[Stable Gallery]] and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. In the same year, the director and curator of Guggenheim Museum [[James Johnson Sweeney]] included Burri in the landmark exhibition ''Younger European Painters: A Selection'' bringing his work to focus in the international community.\n\nBurri's initially seesawing relationship with the [[Venice Biennale]] marked its turning point in 1960, when he was offered his first solo area by [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]. In 1962 [[Cesare Brandi]] presented the ''Plastiche'' at the [[Marlborough Fine Art]] in Rome. The first anthological retrospectives were held around this time and in the following decade, as the solo exhibitions at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris (1972), the one in [[Francis of Assisi]] Sacred Convent (1975) and the great traveling exhibit which started at the [[UCLA]]'s Frederick S. Wight Gallery in Los Angeles, moved to the Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute in San Antonio (Texas) and ended in 1978 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nFrom 1979 on, the ''Large Cycles'' of paintings on ''Cellotex'' dominated Burri's entire subsequent production, which was conceived for big spaces such as cathedrals (like the 1981 Cycle in Florence titled ''Gli Orti'') or former industrial complexes, like the Giudecca Isle's ex-boatyards in Venice, where he exhibited the chromatic series ''Sestante''. In 1994, Burri presented the cycle titled ''Burri The Athens Polyptych. Architecture with Cactus'' for the exhibit curated by Giuliano Serfafini at the [[National Gallery (Athens)]], and then at the Italian Institute of Culture in Madrid (1995).\n\nThe 1996 posthumous anthological exhibition at [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] (Rome) was successfully repeated at [[Lenbachhaus]] (Munich) and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]]. In 2015\u201316 the major retrospective exhibition ''The Trauma of Painting'' organized by Emily Braun at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York (later at the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf in 2016) received much international attention to the painter's art.\n\nAt the conclusion of the centenary of Alberto Burri's birth, the exhibition titled ''Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA'' curated by Bruno Cor\u00e0 established a comparison between the epigones of 20th century material art. The exhibit was held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in the exhibition space of the former tobacco drying sheds which, since 2017, house the painter's graphic collection.<ref>\"''The artworks of post-war artist Alberto Burri celebrated in his native town of Citt\u00e0 di Castello after exhibitions in New York and Dusseldorf''\".

Using the limited amount of materials available in the camp he took on the activity of painting, at the age of almost 30 and without any kind of academic reference.<ref>Barzini, Luigi, \"Rome: Where Art is Forever Italy\", The New York Times (22 December 1969). p.40</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Parola_di_Burri_I_pensieri_di_una_vita.html?id=s0fNDAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y Zorzi, Stefano (2016).

He moved to Rome as a guest of the violinist and composer Annibale Bucchi, his mother's cousin, who encouraged his activity as a painter.<ref>Carandente, Giovanni (2007). \"Burri: memories of a friendship, 1948\u20131988\".

However, Burri\u2019s artistic production flowed definitively into abstract forms before the end of the same year, the use of small format [[tempera]] resulting from the influence of such artists as [[Jean Dubuffet]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], whose studio was visited by Burri during a trip to Paris in the winter of 1948.<ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. p. 37</ref>\n\n==== Tars, Molds, Hunchbacks ====\nBurri's artistic research became personal in short time, between 1948 and 1950 he began experimenting with using unusual, 'unorthodox' materials such as [[tar]], [[sand]], [[zinc]], [[pumice]], and [[Aluminium]] dust as well as [[Polyvinyl chloride]] glue, this last material being elevated to the same importance as oil colors. During this artistic transition, the painter showed his sensitivity to the mixed-media type of abstraction of [[Enrico Prampolini]], a central figure in Italian [[Abstract art]]. Nonetheless Burri went one step further in his ''Catrami'' (Tars), presenting tar not as a simple [[collage]] material, but as an actual color which \u2013 by way of different lucid and opaque shades in monochrome black\u2013, blended itself with the totality of the painting.<ref>Brandi, Cesare (1963). ''Burri''. Rome: Editalia. p.22: \u201c''Burri did not begins with collage: the first pictures of '48 are all paintings. But in the earliest of them, the first Nero (Black) one, with a little blue square (and round and oval elements), the passage from shiny to opaque black acts not as a color but as material, like the right and wrong sides of a piece of satin''.\u201d</ref><ref>Serafini, Giuliano (2015). ''Burri: matter first''. Milan: Giunti. pp. 42\u201343: \u201c''Burri intuition was decisive. For centuries, art history has posited a kind of duality in which matter served as artist\u2019s tool, as the factor that, to become form, must necessarily be subjected to an operation of sublimation''.\u201d</ref><ref>Cor\u00e0, Bruno (2015). \"Burri, the First One Hundred Years of Greatness\".

In some artworks of the same period which he called ''Gobbi'' (Hunchbacks), Burri focused on the painting\u2019s spatial interaction, achieving another original outcome due to the incorporation of tree branches on the rear of the canvas which pushed two-dimensionality towards [[Three-dimensional space]].<ref name=\":1\">Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn (1997). \"Alberto Burri, The Surface at Risk\", in Tolomeo, Maria Grazia, Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn.

In a word, matter became the subject''.\"</ref>\n\nThe formal artistic elegance and the spatial balances obtained through aeroform steams, craters, rips, overlapping color layers and different forms, differentiated Burri\u2019s art, founded on attentive reflections and precise calculations, from the impulsive gestures that characterized [[Action painting]] during the same period.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2016). \"Burri, de Kooning, Pollock: Parallel Convergences\".

Crespi, Stefano (1996). ''Pittura dell\u2019ultimo giorno, Scritti per Alberto Burri.''

Exhibition catalogue. p. 7</ref>\n\n==== Combustions, Woods, Irons, Plastics ====\nThe procedure adopted for the ''Combustioni'' (Combustions) passed from paper to the ''Legni'' (Woods) around 1957, in thin sheets of wood veneer fastened to canvas and other supports.<ref>Nordland, Gerald (1977). ''Alberto Burri A retrospective view 1948\u20131977.'' Los Angeles: Frederick S. Wight Art Gallery Editions. Exhibition catalogue. p. 46: ''It must be noted that the Englishman Gwyther Irwin, came to adopt the legno procedure in 1961, and that the colorful French artist, Yves Klein also made his first fire paintings with a flame-thrower in the year 1961''.</ref>\n\nIn the same period Burri was also working on the ''Ferri'' (Irons), creations made out of metal sheets cut, and welded by [[Blow torch]], to aim the general balance of the elements. The best known application of this procedure was reached in the ''Plastiche'' (Plastics) during the Sixties, when a gradual critic openness towards Burri's art showed up in Italy as well.\n\nThe blowtorch was only apparently a destructive device. Indeed, the craters modeled by the flame on cellophane, black, red or transparent plastic or on the ''Bianchi Plastica'' (White Plastic) series, in which the transparent plastic is laid on a white or black support, were lightly directed by the painter's blowing. The balances of the matter were thus highlighted once again, in a sort of 'defiance' towards of flame's randomness on the one hand, and in a sort of attempt to 'dominate chance', intrinsic to Burri's philosophy, on the other.<ref>Pirovano, Carlo (1996). \"The Seasons of Fire\".

The painter progressively detached himself from the city's artistic community, deeply focusing on his own work.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). \"Resident outsider\". In Melandri, Luisa, with Duncan, Michael. ''Combustione, Alberto Burri and America''. Los Angeles: Santa Monica Museum of Art. Exhibition catalogue. p. 22</ref> During his recurrent trips to [[Death Valley National Park]], the artist found in the natural cracking of the desert the visual spur which led him, starting from 1973, to create ''Cretti'' (Cracks) developing the use of the crackled paint effect of his 1940's artworks.<ref>Melandri, Luisa (2010). Ibidem. p. 23: \"''The noun 'cretto' \u2013 from the verb crettare in rare old Tuscan Italian \u2013 refers to small cracks that appear in plaster walls. The wod was originally most often used to describe the cracks that might appear in the 'intonaco' of a fresco. The term is therefore not only descriptive but links Burri\u2019s works to the mural traditions of his native Italy \u2013 and to Renaissance art-making''.\"</ref>\n\nEmploying a special mixture of kaolin, resins and pigment, the painter dried its surface with the heat of an oven. Burri arrested the heating process at the desired moment using a PVA glue layer, thus obtaining greater and lesser cracking effects, which were always balanced thanks to the painter's extensive knowledge of chemistry.<ref>Tomassoni, Italo (2015): \"Alberto Burri: His Cretti (Cracks) and Their Roots in the History of Art\".

It is one of the largest works of art ever realized, extending over an area of approximately 85,000 square meters. Its white concrete covering expands over the town, following the old street map in long arterial roads and corridors, which are walkable, thus symbolically bringing the devastated town back to life.\n\n==== Cellotex and the large cycles of paintings ====\nDuring the Seventies Burri's art saw a gradual transition towards wider dimensions, while retrospectives followed one another around the world. The great solo exhibition crossing the United States in 1977\u201378 and ending at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York is one example.\n\nIn the 1979 cycle of paintings called ''Il Viaggio'' (The Journey) Burri retraced, through ten monumental compositions, the key moments of his artistic production.<ref>The artist polemically excluded the ''Sacchi'', which many critics were considering his major works, to emancipate his production from the \u2018''lazy crystallization of his expressive message''\u2019 (Pirovano, Carlo. 2015. \"Burri, the Investigation of Space\".

An example is the recurrent motif of the [[archivolt]], viewed in its plain form in painting and in perspective in such iron sculptures as ''Teatro Scultura'' \u2013 a work presented at 1984 Venice Biennale \u2013, and in the 1972 [[Ogive]] series in ''[[ceramics]]''.<ref>Duranti, Massimo (2011).\"From form to matter, to abstract form: the development of Alberto Burri\u2019s aesthetic devolution\".

Other sculptures on iron are permanently held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello museums, Ravenna, Celle (Pistoia), Perugia and Milan, where the rotating wings of the ''Teatro Continuo'' (Continuous Theatre) is both real scenic space and sculpture, employing the [[Sforza Castle]] park as natural backcloth.<ref>The work was built on the occasion of the 1973 Milan Triennale, then demolished in 1989 by the municipality.

''Il Teatro Continuo di Alberto Burri''. Mantova: Corraini. Italian/English. {{ISBN|9788875705091}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre sets ===\nTheater had a privileged role in Burri's artistic production. Though in isolated interventions, the painter worked in the fields of prose, ballet and opera. In 1963 Burri designed the sets for ''Spirituals'', [[Morton Gould]]'s ballet at [[La Scala]], in Milan. The painter's ''Plastiche'' emphasized the dramatic force of such plays as the 1969 [[Ignazio Silone]] stage adaptation in San Miniato (Pisa) and [[Tristan and Iseult]], performed in 1975 at the Teatro Regio in Turin.\n\nIn 1973 Burri designed sets and costumes for ''November Steps'', conceived by his wife Minsa Craig, with a score by [[Toru Takemitsu]]. The ballet was interacting with an early example of visual art by a film clip depicting how the ''Cretti'' progressively came into being.\n\n== Graphic work ==\nBurri never considered graphic art of secondary importance to painting. He participated intensively in the experimentation of new printing techniques as the 1965 reproduction of the ''Combustioni'' \u2013 in which the brothers Valter and Eleonora Rossi perfectly succeeded in mimicking the effect of burning on paper \u2013, or the irregular ''Cretti'' cavities (1971) with the same printers.\n\nFurther innovative developments can be found in the silk screens ''Sestante'' (1987\u201389) \u2013 with the help of Burri's old friend and collaborator [[Nuvolo]] \u2013 to the ''Mixoblack'' series (1988), created in Los Angeles with printers Luis and Lea Remba on marble dust and sand in particular three-dimensional effects.<ref>Sarteanesi, Chiara (2015). \"Tradition and Innovation in Alberto Burri\u2019s Graphic Art\".

Brin and her husband, Gaspero del Corso founded the Obelisco Gallery, the first art gallery to open in Postwar Rome, featuring the 1952 solo exhibition ''Muffe e Neri'' (Molds and Blacks) and the first ''Combustions'' in 1957. The Burri's first exhibition with the ''Sacchi'' was presented by the poet [[Emilio Villa]] at the Origine Foundation in 1952, in confirmation of his increasingly original production. The ''Ferri'' (Irons) were held at Galleria Blu in Milan.\n\nFrom 1953 on, Burri regularly exhibited his works in the United States, at the Allan Frumkin Gallery (Chicago), the [[Stable Gallery]] and the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. In the same year, the director and curator of Guggenheim Museum [[James Johnson Sweeney]] included Burri in the landmark exhibition ''Younger European Painters: A Selection'' bringing his work to focus in the international community.\n\nBurri's initially seesawing relationship with the [[Venice Biennale]] marked its turning point in 1960, when he was offered his first solo area by [[Giulio Carlo Argan]]. In 1962 [[Cesare Brandi]] presented the ''Plastiche'' at the [[Marlborough Fine Art]] in Rome. The first anthological retrospectives were held around this time and in the following decade, as the solo exhibitions at the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne]] in Paris (1972), the one in [[Francis of Assisi]] Sacred Convent (1975) and the great traveling exhibit which started at the [[UCLA]]'s Frederick S. Wight Gallery in Los Angeles, moved to the Marion Koogler McNay Art Institute in San Antonio (Texas) and ended in 1978 at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]].\n\nFrom 1979 on, the ''Large Cycles'' of paintings on ''Cellotex'' dominated Burri's entire subsequent production, which was conceived for big spaces such as cathedrals (like the 1981 Cycle in Florence titled ''Gli Orti'') or former industrial complexes, like the Giudecca Isle's ex-boatyards in Venice, where he exhibited the chromatic series ''Sestante''. In 1994, Burri presented the cycle titled ''Burri The Athens Polyptych. Architecture with Cactus'' for the exhibit curated by Giuliano Serfafini at the [[National Gallery (Athens)]], and then at the Italian Institute of Culture in Madrid (1995).\n\nThe 1996 posthumous anthological exhibition at [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] (Rome) was successfully repeated at [[Lenbachhaus]] (Munich) and at the [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]]. In 2015\u201316 the major retrospective exhibition ''The Trauma of Painting'' organized by Emily Braun at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York (later at the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf in 2016) received much international attention to the painter's art.\n\nAt the conclusion of the centenary of Alberto Burri's birth, the exhibition titled ''Burri Lo spazio di materia tra Europa e USA'' curated by Bruno Cor\u00e0 established a comparison between the epigones of 20th century material art. The exhibit was held in Citt\u00e0 di Castello, in the exhibition space of the former tobacco drying sheds which, since 2017, house the painter's graphic collection.<ref>\"''The artworks of post-war artist Alberto Burri celebrated in his native town of Citt\u00e0 di Castello after exhibitions in New York and Dusseldorf''\".

For the same festival the former tobacco drying sheds became the setting of a composition by [[Alvin Curran]] in 2002.<ref>[http://www.alvincurran.com/writings/brut%20beat.html Alvin Curran official website]</ref>\n\nThe ''Large Cretto'' at Gibellina has functioned several times as a set for the ''Orestiadi'' Festival and as set for a 2015 performance by artists [[Giancarlo Neri]] and [[Robert Del Naja]] ([[Massive Attack]]). The 1973 ballet ''November Steps'', with Burri's sets and costumes, was proposed again in 2015 by the Guggenheim Museum, New York. In 2016 choreographer Virgilio Sieni created the work ''Quintetti sul Nero'',<ref>[http://www.virgiliosieni.it/schede/quintetti-sul-nero/ Virgilio Sieni official website \"Quintetti sul nero\" ]</ref> inspired by the Umbrian master. In 2017 [[John Densmore]] ([[The Doors]]) performed in front of the ''Grande Nero Cretto'' (Large Black Crack) at [[ucla]], Los Angeles during the event ''Burri Prometheia''.<ref name=\"ucla-2017\" />\n\nThroughout the years, fashion designers have drawn inspiration from Burri, from [[Roberto Capucci]], with his 1969 item of clothing ''Omaggio a Burri'' which has asymmetric features recreating the ''Cretti'' effects, up to [[Laura Biagiotti]] for her (last) 2017 collection.\n\nIn 1987 Burri created the official [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] posters. The [[Umbria Jazz Festival]] used the ''Sestante'' series for the 2015 edition poster, celebrating the artist's centenary of birth.\n\n== Documentaries ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n* 1960 Carandente, Giovanni.

Generally, higher density is more desirable, for it allows more data to be stored in the same physical space. Density therefore has a direct relationship to storage capacity of a given medium. Density also generally affects the performance within a particular medium, as well as price.\n\n== Storage device classes ==\n\n=== Magnetic disk media ===\n[[Hard disk drive]]s store data in the magnetic polarization of small patches of the surface coating on a disk. The maximum areal density is defined by the size of the magnetic particles in the surface, as well as the size of the \"head\" used to read and write the data.

This is most obvious when considering various disk-based media, where the storage elements are spread over the surface of the disk and must be physically rotated under the \"head\" in order to be read or written. Higher density means more data moves under the head for any given mechanical movement.\n\nFor example, we can calculate the effective transfer speed for a floppy disc by determining how fast the bits move under the head. A standard 3\u00bd-[[inch]] floppy disk spins at 300&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and the innermost track about 66&nbsp;mm long (10.5&nbsp;mm radius). At 300&nbsp;rpm the linear speed of the media under the head is thus about 66&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 300&nbsp;rpm = 19800&nbsp;mm/minute, or 330&nbsp;mm/s. Along that track the [[bit]]s are stored at a density of 686&nbsp;bit/mm, which means that the head sees 686&nbsp;bit/mm&nbsp;\u00d7 330&nbsp;mm/s = 226,380&nbsp;bit/s (or 28.3&nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s).\n\nNow consider an improvement to the design that doubles the density of the bits by reducing sample length and keeping the same track spacing. This would double the transfer speed because the bits would be passing under the head twice as fast. Early floppy disk interfaces were designed for 250&nbsp;kbit/s transfer speeds, but were rapidly outperformed with the introduction of the \"high density\" 1.44&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] (1,440&nbsp;KiB) floppies in the 1980s. The vast majority of PCs included interfaces designed for high density drives that ran at 500&nbsp;kbit/s instead. These, too, were completely overwhelmed by newer devices like the [[LS-120]], which were forced to use higher-speed interfaces such as [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]].\n\nAlthough the effect on performance is most obvious on rotating media, similar effects come into play even for solid-state media like [[Flash RAM]] or [[DRAM]]. In this case the performance is generally defined by the time it takes for the electrical signals to travel through the [[computer bus]] to the chips, and then through the chips to the individual \"cells\" used to store data (each cell holds one bit).\n\nOne defining electrical property is the resistance of the wires inside the chips. As the cell size decreases, through the improvements in [[semiconductor fabrication]] that lead to [[Moore's Law]], the resistance is reduced and less power is needed to operate the cells. This, in turn, means that less [[electric current]] is needed for operation, and thus less time is needed to send the required amount of electrical charge into the system. In DRAM, in particular, the amount of charge that needs to be stored in a cell's [[capacitor]] also directly affects this time.\n\nAs fabrication has improved, solid-state memory has improved dramatically in terms of performance. Modern DRAM chips had operational speeds on the order of 10&nbsp;ns or less. A less obvious effect is that as density improves, the number of [[DIMM]]s needed to supply any particular amount of memory decreases, which in turn means less DIMMs overall in any particular computer.

This is most obvious when considering various disk-based media, where the storage elements are spread over the surface of the disk and must be physically rotated under the \"head\" in order to be read or written. Higher density means more data moves under the head for any given mechanical movement.\n\nFor example, we can calculate the effective transfer speed for a floppy disc by determining how fast the bits move under the head. A standard 3\u00bd-[[inch]] floppy disk spins at 300&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], and the innermost track about 66&nbsp;mm long (10.5&nbsp;mm radius). At 300&nbsp;rpm the linear speed of the media under the head is thus about 66&nbsp;mm&nbsp;\u00d7 300&nbsp;rpm = 19800&nbsp;mm/minute, or 330&nbsp;mm/s. Along that track the [[bit]]s are stored at a density of 686&nbsp;bit/mm, which means that the head sees 686&nbsp;bit/mm&nbsp;\u00d7 330&nbsp;mm/s = 226,380&nbsp;bit/s (or 28.3&nbsp;[[kibibyte|KiB]]/s).\n\nNow consider an improvement to the design that doubles the density of the bits by reducing sample length and keeping the same track spacing. This would double the transfer speed because the bits would be passing under the head twice as fast. Early floppy disk interfaces were designed for 250&nbsp;kbit/s transfer speeds, but were rapidly outperformed with the introduction of the \"high density\" 1.44&nbsp;[[megabyte|MB]] (1,440&nbsp;KiB) floppies in the 1980s. The vast majority of PCs included interfaces designed for high density drives that ran at 500&nbsp;kbit/s instead. These too were completely overwhelmed by newer devices like the [[LS-120]], which were forced to use higher-speed interfaces such as [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]].\n\nAlthough the effect on performance is most obvious on rotating media, similar effects come into play even for solid-state media like [[Flash RAM]] or [[DRAM]]. In this case the performance is generally defined by the time it takes for the electrical signals to travel though the [[computer bus]] to the chips, and then through the chips to the individual \"cells\" used to store data (each cell holds one bit).\n\nOne defining electrical property is the resistance of the wires inside the chips. As the cell size decreases, through the improvements in [[semiconductor fabrication]] that lead to [[Moore's Law]], the resistance is reduced and less power is needed to operate the cells. This, in turn, means that less [[electric current]] is needed for operation, and thus less time is needed to send the required amount of electrical charge into the system. In DRAM in particular the amount of charge that needs to be stored in a cell's [[capacitor]] also directly affects this time.\n\nAs fabrication has improved, solid-state memory has improved dramatically in terms of performance. Modern DRAM chips had operational speeds on the order of 10&nbsp;ns or less. A less obvious effect is that as density improves, the number of [[DIMM]]s needed to supply any particular amount of memory decreases, which in turn means less DIMMs overall in any particular computer. This often leads to improved performance as well, as there is less bus traffic. However, this effect is generally not linear.\n\n== Effects on price ==\n{{Globalize|date=January 2014}}\nStorage density also has a strong effect on the price of memory, although in this case the reasons are not so obvious.\n\nIn the case of disk-based media, the primary cost is the moving parts inside the drive.

''Thunder Shield''), was a [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Dano-Norwegian]] nobleman and an eminent naval [[flag officer]] in the service of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy]]. He rose to the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]] for his services in the [[Great Northern War]]. Born in [[Trondheim]], Peter Wessel travelled to [[Copenhagen]] in 1704, and was employed in the navy. He won a name for himself through audacity and courage, and was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] as ''Peter Tordenskiold'' by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] in 1716. His greatest exploit came later that year, as he destroyed the supply fleet of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] at the [[Battle of Dynekilen]]. In 1720, he was killed in a [[duel]]. In Denmark and Norway he is among the most famous national naval heroes. He experienced an unusually rapid rise in rank and died when he was only 30 years old.\n\n==Name==\nHis birth name was Peter Jansen Wessel. His name occurs with spellings as ''Peder'' and ''Pitter''. Upon his ennoblement in 1716, he received the name ''Tordenskiold'' meaning \"Thunder Shield\".<ref>[https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of-war/peter-wessel-tordenskjold-when-scandinavias-gutsiest-admiral-ran-out-of-ammo-he-asked-his-opponent-for-more/ When Scandinavia\u2019s gutsiest Admiral ran out of ammo, he asked his enemy for more]</ref> This was also the orthographical form which he used. In newer times, the form ''Tordenskjold'' has become usual.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, he was the tenth child of [[alderman]] Jan Wessel, and the brother of later [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Caspar von Wessel]]. Peter Wessel was a wild, unruly lad who gave his pious parents much trouble,<ref name=\"bricka\"/> eventually stowing away on a ship heading for [[Copenhagen]] in 1704. In Copenhagen, he unsuccessfully sought to become a navy [[cadet]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund%2c_jura_og_politik/Diverse_historie/Marine-_og_s%c3%b8krigshistorie/Peter_Wessel_Tordenskiold Peter Wessel Tordenskiold] at Gyldendals \u00c5bne Encyklop\u00e6di.</ref> He befriended the king's chaplain Peder Jespersen, who sent Wessel on a voyage to the [[West Indies]], and finally procured a vacant cadetship for him. After further voyages, this time to the [[East Indies]], Wessel was appointed [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy]] on 7 July 1711, and went on to serve on the [[frigate]] ''Postillion''. While on ''Postillion'', he befriended Norwegian admiral baron [[Waldemar L\u00f8vendal]],<ref name=\"bricka\"/> who was the first to recognize the young man's potential as a naval officer.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> L\u00f8vendal soon made Peter Wessel the captain of the 4-gun [[sloop]] ''Ormen'' ({{HMS|Serpent|1695|6}}).<ref name=\"bricka\">[[Carl Frederik Bricka|Bricka, Carl Frederik]], ''Dansk Biografisk Lexikon'', vol.

With, \"Tordenskjold, Peder\".</ref>\n\n===Early service time===\nWessel started his navy service during the [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]], cruising about the Swedish coast in ''Ormen'' picking up useful information about the enemy.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> In June 1712, L\u00f8vendal promoted him to the 18-gun frigate ''[[L\u00f8vendals Galej]]'', against the advice of the Danish admiralty, who considered Wessel unreliable. After officially complaining about his dreary commanding officer [[Daniel Jacob Wilster]] in Norway, Wessel was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea]] command of [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve]], who appreciated and utilized Wessel's courage.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> Wessel was already renowned for two things: the audacity with which he attacked any Swedish vessels he came across regardless of the odds, and his unique seamanship, which always enabled him to evade capture.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Tordenskjold, Peder |volume=27 |page=50}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Northern War had now entered upon its later stage, when [[Sweden]], beset on every side by foes, employed her fleet principally to transport troops and stores to the distressed [[Swedish Pomerania]] provinces. The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point. He was continually snapping up transports, dashing into the fjords where her vessels lay concealed, and holding up her detached frigates.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He was a part of Gyldenl\u00f8ve's fleet which succeeded in destroying a large number of Swedish transport ships at [[R\u00fcgen]] on 29 September 1712, and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to [[Captain Lieutenant]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/> His successes compelled the Swedes to [[Bounty (reward)|post a reward]] for his capture, while his free and easy ways also won him enemies in the Danish navy, who deplored his almost [[Privateer]]-like conduct.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/>\n\n===Court-martial===\nIn 1714, Wessel was [[court-martial]]led after an indecisive sea battle with a Swedish frigate. The account of the incident is verified by the legal proceedings from November 1714. On 26 July 1714, he encountered a frigate under English flag near [[Lindesnes]], while flying a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] flag on the ''L\u00f8vendals Gallej'' himself. The other frigate was ''De Olbing Galley'' carrying 28 guns, which had been equipped in [[England]] for the Swedes and was on its way to [[Gothenburg]] under the command of an English captain named Bactmann. ''De Olbing Galley'' signalled for ''L\u00f8vendals Gallej'' to come closer, and as Wessel raised the Danish flag, Bactmann fired a [[broadside]] at him.<ref name=\"bjerg\">Hans Christian Bjerg, \"[https://archive.is/20130212170512/http://www.danske-tordenskiold-venner.dk/tordenskiold/artikler/02_kanon_pokal.htm P\u00e5 kanoner og pokaler]\", [[Op-ed]] in [[Jyllands-Posten]], 29 July 1964.</ref> In the English captain, Wessel met a tough match.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> The combat lasted all day, and when ''De Olbing Galley'' tried to escape in the evening, Wessel set more sails and continued the duel.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/> The fight was interrupted by nightfall, and renewed again indecisively the following morning.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> Both ships were badly damaged after around 14 hours of fighting, when Wessel was running out of ammunition. He then sent an envoy to the English ship, cordially thanking the English for a good duel, and asked if he could borrow some of their ammunition in order to continue the fight. His request was denied, and the captains drank to each other's health, before the ships dispersed.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Lauring |first=Palle |title=A History of Denmark |year=1986 |page=172}}</ref>\n\nWhen he heard about the incident, king [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] asked for the admiralty to [[court-martial]] Wessel.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> He stood trial in November 1714, accused of disclosing vital military information about his lack of ammunition to the enemy, as well as endangering the ship of king Frederick IV by fighting a superior enemy force.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/> The spirit with which he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less courageous comrades took the fancy of Frederick IV.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He successfully argued a section of the Danish naval code which mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter the size, and was acquitted on 15 December 1714. He then went to the king asking for a promotion, and was raised to the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on 28 December 1714.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/>\n\n===Greatest exploits===\n[[File:Peter Wessel Tordenskiold monument IMG 8658.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Tordenskjold in [[Trondheim]].]]\nWhen, in 1715, the return of King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] from [[Turkey]] to [[Stralsund]] put new life into the dispirited Swedish forces, Wessel distinguished himself in numerous engagements off the coast of Swedish Pomerania,<ref name=\"britannica\"/> under the command of Admiral [[Christian Carl Gabel]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> He did the enemy considerable damage by cutting out his frigates and destroying his transports.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> During a battle at [[Kolberg]] on 24 April 1715, Wessel captured the Swedish [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hans Wachtmeister]],<ref>[http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/udstil/krono1f.htm Store nordiske Krig] at Royal Danish Naval Museum.</ref> as well as the frigate ''Vita \u00d6rn'' (''White Eagle''), which he was granted as his new flagship under the name ''Hvide \u00d8rn''. He then transferred to the main fleet under the command of [[Peter Raben]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\nOn returning to Denmark in the beginning of 1716 he was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] by Frederick IV under the name of ''Tordenskiold''. When in the course of 1716, Charles XII invaded Norway and laid siege to the [[Fredriksten|fortress of Fredrikshald]], Tordenskiold compelled him to raise the siege and retire to Sweden. He did so by pouncing upon the Swedish transport fleet, laden with ammunition and other military stores, which rode at anchor in the narrow and dangerous [[Dynekil Fjord]].<ref name=\"britannica\"/> With two frigates and five smaller ships, he conquered or destroyed around 30 Swedish ships,<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> with little damage to himself during the [[Battle of Dynekilen]] on 8 July 1716.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nFor this his greatest exploit, he was promoted to the rank of [[Post-Captain]], commanding the [[Kattegat]] squadron \u2013 but at the same time incurred the enmity of Christian Carl Gabel, whom he had failed to take into his confidence. Tordenskiold's first important command was the squadron with which he was entrusted in the beginning of 1717 for the purpose of destroying the Swedish [[Gothenburg Squadron]], which interrupted the communications between Denmark and Norway. Owing to the disloyalty of certain of his officers who resented serving under the young adventurer, Tordenskjold failed to do all that was expected of him. His enemies were not slow to take advantage of his partial failure. The old charge of criminal recklessness was revived against him at a second court-martial before which he was summoned in 1718, but his old patron [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve, Count of Sams\u00f8|Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve]] intervened energetically on his behalf, and the charge was quashed.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nIn December 1718, Tordenskiold brought to Frederick IV the welcome news of the death of Charles XII and was in turn made Rear-Admiral. Tordenskiold captured the Swedish fortress of [[Carlsten]] at [[Marstrand]] in 1719.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> The last feat of arms during the Great Northern War was Tordenskiold's partial destruction and partial capture of the Gothenburg Squadron which had so long eluded him, on 26 September 1719. He was rewarded with the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\n===Death by duelling===\nTordenskiold did not long survive the termination of the war. On 12 November 1720, at the age of 30, he was killed in a duel by [[Livonia]]n colonel [[Jakob Axel Sta\u00ebl von Holstein]].<ref name=\"britannica\"/> During a trip to [[Hannover]], Tordenskiold got in a fight with von Holstein, who had been in Swedish military service. The confrontation ended in a duel on the Sehlwiese in [[Gleidingen]] near [[Hildesheim]], in which Tordenskiold was run through by the sword of von Holstein.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> The circumstances around the death of Tordenskiold was set in a conspirational light, as summed up in the contemporary three volume Tordenskiold biography (1747\u20131750) by C. P. Rothe.<ref>H. D. Schepelern, [http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/hto/hto_11rk_0006-PDF/hto_11rk_0006_80526.pdf Blev Tordenskjold myrdet? En Pr\u00f8ve paa C. P. Rothes Kildebenyttelse], ''Historisk Tidsskrift'', vol. 11, 1960. Digitalized by the [[Royal Danish Library]].</ref>\n\nThe duel was encouraged by a dispute with von Holstein, whom Tordenskiold offended by labeling him as a cheat at gambling. At a dinner party, Tordenskiold told of a friend who had been cheated while gambling with a man who claimed to own a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], to which von Holstein announced he was the owner of the said creature and took offence at being called a cheat. This dispute turned into a fight, in which von Holstein unsuccessfully tried to pull a sword, after which Tordenskiold used the pommel of his own sword to beat him up. von Holstein demanded satisfaction through a duel.\nThe details of the duel \u2013 beside it ending with Tordenskiolds death by a single wound by von Holsteins sword \u2013 are not well known. \n\nHis corpse was brought to Copenhagen to the [[Holmen Church]] without much ceremony, as duelling was not allowed according to Danish law of the time. In 1819, he was a buried in a [[sarcophagus]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:T\u00e6ndstikker 3.jpg|thumb|Tordenskjold brand matchbox.]]\nAlthough \u2013 Dynekilen excepted \u2013 Tordenskiold's individual victories were of less importance than [[Christen Thomesen Sehested]]'s at the [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|Siege of Stralsund]] and Ulrich Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve's at R\u00fcgen, he is seen as the most heroic figure of the Great Northern War, after Charles XII.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He is mentioned by name both in the Danish royal anthem \"''[[Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]''\" from 1778<ref>[http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/tema/fokus/nat/k31.html Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410170716/http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/tema/fokus/nat/k31.html |date=2010-04-10 }} at [[Royal Danish Library]].</ref> and the Norwegian unofficial, but used as, national anthem \"''[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]''\" from 1864.\n\nStatues of him have been erected in [[Copenhagen]] (1876),<ref>[http://www.s\u00f8fartshistorie.dk/bissen/bissen28.html Tordenskjold (1690\u20131720)] at S\u00f8fartshistorie.dk.</ref> [[Trondheim]], [[Stavern]], [[Oslo]] and [[Haakonsvern]].

''Thunder Shield''), was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] nobleman and an eminent naval [[flag officer]] in the service of the [[Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy]]. He rose to the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]] for his services in the [[Great Northern War]]. Born in [[Trondheim]], Peter Wessel travelled to [[Copenhagen]] in 1704, and was employed in the navy. He won a name for himself through audacity and courage, and was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] as ''Peter Tordenskiold'' by King [[Frederick IV of Denmark|Frederick IV]] in 1716. His greatest exploit came later that year, as he destroyed the supply fleet of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] at the [[Battle of Dynekilen]]. In 1720, he was killed in a [[duel]]. In Denmark and Norway he is among the most famous national naval heroes. He experienced an unusually rapid rise in rank and died when he was only 30 years old.\n\n==Name==\nHis birth name was Peter Jansen Wessel. His name occurs with spellings as ''Peder'' and ''Pitter''. Upon his ennoblement in 1716, he received the name ''Tordenskiold'' meaning \"Thunder Shield\".<ref>[https://www.historyanswers.co.uk/history-of-war/peter-wessel-tordenskjold-when-scandinavias-gutsiest-admiral-ran-out-of-ammo-he-asked-his-opponent-for-more/ When Scandinavia\u2019s gutsiest Admiral ran out of ammo, he asked his enemy for more]</ref> This was also the orthographical form which he used. In newer times, the form ''Tordenskjold'' has become usual.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Trondheim]] in Norway, he was the tenth child of [[alderman]] Jan Wessel, and the brother of later [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Caspar von Wessel]]. Peter Wessel was a wild, unruly lad who gave his pious parents much trouble,<ref name=\"bricka\"/> eventually stowing away on a ship heading for [[Copenhagen]] in 1704.

After further voyages, this time to the [[East Indies]], Wessel was appointed [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy]] on 7 July 1711, and went on to serve on the [[frigate]] ''Postillion''. While on ''Postillion'', he befriended Norwegian admiral baron [[Waldemar L\u00f8vendal]],<ref name=\"bricka\"/> who was the first to recognize the young man's potential as a naval officer.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> L\u00f8vendal soon made Peter Wessel the captain of the 4-gun [[sloop]] ''Ormen'' ({{HMS|Serpent|1695|6}}).<ref name=\"bricka\">[[Carl Frederik Bricka|Bricka, Carl Frederik]], ''Dansk Biografisk Lexikon'', vol.

With, \"Tordenskjold, Peder\".</ref>\n\n===Early service time===\nWessel started his navy service during the [[Great Northern War]] against [[Sweden]], cruising about the Swedish coast in ''Ormen'' picking up useful information about the enemy.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> In June 1712, L\u00f8vendal promoted him to the 18-gun frigate ''[[L\u00f8vendals Galej]]'', against the advice of the Danish admiralty, who considered Wessel unreliable. After officially complaining about his dreary commanding officer [[Daniel Jacob Wilster]] in Norway, Wessel was transferred to the [[Baltic Sea]] command of [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve]], who appreciated and utilized Wessel's courage.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> Wessel was already renowned for two things: the audacity with which he attacked any Swedish vessels he came across regardless of the odds, and his unique seamanship, which always enabled him to evade capture.<ref name=\"britannica\">{{EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Tordenskjold, Peder |volume=27 |page=50}}</ref>\n\nThe Great Northern War had now entered upon its later stage, when [[Sweden]], beset on every side by foes, employed her fleet principally to transport troops and stores to the distressed [[Swedish Pomerania]] provinces. The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point. He was continually snapping up transports, dashing into the fjords where her vessels lay concealed, and holding up her detached frigates.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He was a part of Gyldenl\u00f8ve's fleet which succeeded in destroying a large number of Swedish transport ships at [[R\u00fcgen]] on 29 September 1712, and was promoted from Second Lieutenant to [[Captain Lieutenant]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/> His successes compelled the Swedes to [[Bounty (reward)|post a reward]] for his capture, while his free and easy ways also won him enemies in the Danish navy, who deplored his almost [[Privateer]]-like conduct.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/>\n\n===Court-martial===\nIn 1714, Wessel was [[court-martial]]led after an indecisive sea battle with a Swedish frigate. The account of the incident is verified by the legal proceedings from November 1714. On 26 July 1714, he encountered a frigate under English flag near [[Lindesnes]], while flying a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] flag on the ''L\u00f8vendals Gallej'' himself. The other frigate was ''De Olbing Galley'' carrying 28 guns, which had been equipped in [[England]] for the Swedes and was on its way to [[Gothenburg]] under the command of an English captain named Bactmann. ''De Olbing Galley'' signalled for ''L\u00f8vendals Gallej'' to come closer, and as Wessel raised the Danish flag, Bactmann fired a [[broadside]] at him.<ref name=\"bjerg\">Hans Christian Bjerg, \"[https://archive.is/20130212170512/http://www.danske-tordenskiold-venner.dk/tordenskiold/artikler/02_kanon_pokal.htm P\u00e5 kanoner og pokaler]\", [[Op-ed]] in [[Jyllands-Posten]], 29 July 1964.</ref> In the English captain, Wessel met a tough match.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> The combat lasted all day, and when ''De Olbing Galley'' tried to escape in the evening, Wessel set more sails and continued the duel.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/> The fight was interrupted by nightfall, and renewed again indecisively the following morning.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> Both ships were badly damaged after around 14 hours of fighting, when Wessel was running out of ammunition. He then sent an envoy to the English ship, cordially thanking the English for a good duel, and asked if he could borrow some of their ammunition in order to continue the fight. His request was denied, and the captains drank to each other's health, before the ships dispersed.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Lauring |first=Palle |title=A History of Denmark |year=1986 |page=172}}</ref>\n\nWhen he heard about the incident, king [[Frederick IV of Denmark]] asked for the admiralty to [[court-martial]] Wessel.<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> He stood trial in November 1714, accused of disclosing vital military information about his lack of ammunition to the enemy, as well as endangering the ship of king Frederick IV by fighting a superior enemy force.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/> The spirit with which he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less courageous comrades took the fancy of Frederick IV.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He successfully argued a section of the Danish naval code which mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter the size, and was acquitted on 15 December 1714. He then went to the king asking for a promotion, and was raised to the rank of [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] on 28 December 1714.<ref name=\"bjerg\"/>\n\n===Greatest exploits===\n[[File:Peter Wessel Tordenskiold monument IMG 8658.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Tordenskjold in [[Trondheim]].]]\nWhen, in 1715, the return of King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] from [[Turkey]] to [[Stralsund]] put new life into the dispirited Swedish forces, Wessel distinguished himself in numerous engagements off the coast of Swedish Pomerania,<ref name=\"britannica\"/> under the command of Admiral [[Christian Carl Gabel]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> He did the enemy considerable damage by cutting out his frigates and destroying his transports.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> During a battle at [[Kolberg]] on 24 April 1715, Wessel captured the Swedish [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Hans Wachtmeister]],<ref>[http://www.orlogsmuseet.dk/udstil/krono1f.htm Store nordiske Krig] at Royal Danish Naval Museum.</ref> as well as the frigate ''Vita \u00d6rn'' (''White Eagle''), which he was granted as his new flagship under the name ''Hvide \u00d8rn''. He then transferred to the main fleet under the command of [[Peter Raben]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\nOn returning to Denmark in the beginning of 1716 he was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] by Frederick IV under the name of ''Tordenskiold''. When in the course of 1716, Charles XII invaded Norway and laid siege to the [[Fredriksten|fortress of Fredrikshald]], Tordenskiold compelled him to raise the siege and retire to Sweden. He did so by pouncing upon the Swedish transport fleet, laden with ammunition and other military stores, which rode at anchor in the narrow and dangerous [[Dynekil Fjord]].<ref name=\"britannica\"/> With two frigates and five smaller ships, he conquered or destroyed around 30 Swedish ships,<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/> with little damage to himself during the [[Battle of Dynekilen]] on 8 July 1716.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nFor this his greatest exploit, he was promoted to the rank of [[Post-Captain]], commanding the [[Kattegat]] squadron \u2013 but at the same time incurred the enmity of Christian Carl Gabel, whom he had failed to take into his confidence. Tordenskiold's first important command was the squadron with which he was entrusted in the beginning of 1717 for the purpose of destroying the Swedish [[Gothenburg Squadron]], which interrupted the communications between Denmark and Norway. Owing to the disloyalty of certain of his officers who resented serving under the young adventurer, Tordenskjold failed to do all that was expected of him. His enemies were not slow to take advantage of his partial failure. The old charge of criminal recklessness was revived against him at a second court-martial before which he was summoned in 1718, but his old patron [[Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve, Count of Sams\u00f8|Ulrik Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve]] intervened energetically on his behalf, and the charge was quashed.<ref name=\"britannica\"/>\n\nIn December 1718, Tordenskiold brought to Frederick IV the welcome news of the death of Charles XII and was in turn made Rear-Admiral. Tordenskiold captured the Swedish fortress of [[Carlsten]] at [[Marstrand]] in 1719.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> The last feat of arms during the Great Northern War was Tordenskiold's partial destruction and partial capture of the Gothenburg Squadron which had so long eluded him, on 26 September 1719. He was rewarded with the rank of [[Vice-Admiral]].<ref name=\"bricka\"/>\n\n===Death by duelling===\nTordenskiold did not long survive the termination of the war. On 12 November 1720, at the age of 30, he was killed in a duel by [[Livonia]]n colonel [[Jakob Axel Sta\u00ebl von Holstein]].<ref name=\"britannica\"/> During a trip to [[Hannover]], Tordenskiold got in a fight with von Holstein, who had been in Swedish military service. The confrontation ended in a duel on the Sehlwiese in [[Gleidingen]] near [[Hildesheim]], in which Tordenskiold was run through by the sword of von Holstein.<ref name=\"bricka\"/> The circumstances around the death of Tordenskiold was set in a conspirational light, as summed up in the contemporary three volume Tordenskiold biography (1747\u20131750) by C. P. Rothe.<ref>H. D. Schepelern, [http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/hto/hto_11rk_0006-PDF/hto_11rk_0006_80526.pdf Blev Tordenskjold myrdet? En Pr\u00f8ve paa C. P. Rothes Kildebenyttelse], ''Historisk Tidsskrift'', vol. 11, 1960. Digitalized by the [[Royal Danish Library]].</ref>\n\nThe duel was encouraged by a dispute with von Holstein, whom Tordenskiold offended by labeling him as a cheat at gambling. At a dinner party, Tordenskiold told of a friend who had been cheated while gambling with a man who claimed to own a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], to which von Holstein announced he was the owner of the said creature and took offence at being called a cheat. This dispute turned into a fight, in which von Holstein unsuccessfully tried to pull a sword, after which Tordenskiold used the pommel of his own sword to beat him up. von Holstein demanded satisfaction through a duel.\nThe details of the duel \u2013 beside it ending with Tordenskiolds death by a single wound by von Holsteins sword \u2013 are not well known. \n\nHis corpse was brought to Copenhagen to the [[Holmen Church]] without much ceremony, as duelling was not allowed according to Danish law of the time. In 1819, he was a buried in a [[sarcophagus]].<ref name=\"gyldendal\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:T\u00e6ndstikker 3.jpg|thumb|Tordenskjold brand matchbox.]]\nAlthough \u2013 Dynekilen excepted \u2013 Tordenskiold's individual victories were of less importance than [[Christen Thomesen Sehested]]'s at the [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|Siege of Stralsund]] and Ulrich Christian Gyldenl\u00f8ve's at R\u00fcgen, he is seen as the most heroic figure of the Great Northern War, after Charles XII.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> He is mentioned by name both in the Danish royal anthem \"''[[Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]''\" from 1778<ref>[http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/tema/fokus/nat/k31.html Kong Christian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410170716/http://www.kb.dk/da/nb/tema/fokus/nat/k31.html |date=2010-04-10 }} at [[Royal Danish Library]].</ref> and the Norwegian unofficial, but used as, national anthem \"''[[Ja, vi elsker dette landet]]''\" from 1864.\n\nStatues of him have been erected in [[Copenhagen]] (1876),<ref>[http://www.s\u00f8fartshistorie.dk/bissen/bissen28.html Tordenskjold (1690\u20131720)] at S\u00f8fartshistorie.dk.</ref> [[Trondheim]], [[Stavern]], [[Oslo]] and [[Haakonsvern]].

Hydrogen can play a role in a sustainable energy system if the electricity used to produce it is generated from sustainable sources, such as wind or solar. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. Hydrogen can be distributed by ship<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ae16d5e-1bd4-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4|title=Japan launches first liquid hydrogen carrier ship |last=|first=|date= |website=ft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-01}}</ref> or through pipelines.

Nearly all hydrogen is created by processing fossil fuels, which results in high greenhouse gas emissions but is currently cheaper than creating hydrogen via electrolysis. The process can be made more sustainable by using [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to remove most of the carbon dioxide that is emitted.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Renewable energy|Energy|Ecology|Climate change}}\n* [[Fossil fuel divestment]]\n* [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources]]\n* [[Environmental impact of the energy industry]]\n* [[Sustainable Energy for All]] initiative\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Cite book  | ref= {{harvid|Bruckner|2014}}\n |chapter= Chapter 7: Energy Systems\n |chapter-url= https://archive.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter7.pdf\n |display-authors= 4\n |first1= T.   |last1= Bruckner\n |first2= I.
