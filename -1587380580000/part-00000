Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).\n\nProminent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], that it is [[unsustainable]], that it creates [[economic inequality]], that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] and that it incentivizes [[imperialist]] expansion and [[Military\u2013industrial complex|war]].\n\n== History ==\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAccording to contemporary critics{{quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].<ref name=\"conditionsworking\">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n{{see also|Anarchism|Libertarian socialism}}\nThe authors of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5).

In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected.

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments.

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

In an economic sense, exploitation is often related to the [[Wage slavery|expropriation]] of labor for [[profit (economics)|profit]] and based on [[Karl Marx]]'s version of the [[labor theory of value]].

As sultan [[Mehmed II]] conquered [[Constantinople]] (today named [[Istanbul]]) in 1453, the state grew into a mighty empire, expanding deeply into Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. The Empire reached its apex under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the 16th century when it stretched from the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east to [[Algeria]] in the west; and from [[Yemen]] in the south to [[Hungary]] and parts of [[Ukraine]] in the north. From 1699 onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to lose territory over the course of the next two centuries due to internal stagnation, costly defensive wars, European colonialism, and nationalist revolts among its multiethnic subjects. The empire came to an end in the aftermath of its defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in [[World War I]]. The empire was officially abolished by the [[Government of the Grand National Assembly|Government of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara]] in November 1922 following the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish War of Independence (1919\u201323)]].\n\n==Rise of the Ottoman Empire (1299\u20131490)==\n{{Main|Rise of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{further|Ottoman Dynasty|Gaza Thesis}}\n\nWith the demise of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] (c. 1300), [[Anatolia]] was divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called [[Anatolian Beyliks]]. By 1300, a weakened [[Byzantine Empire]] had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of [[Ertu\u011frul]], around [[Eski\u015fehir]] in western Anatolia. In the foundation myth expressed in the story known as \"[[Osman's Dream]]\", the young Osman was inspired to conquest by a prescient vision of empire (according to his dream, the empire is a big tree whose roots spread through three continents and whose branches cover the sky).<ref name=kin24>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'' (Morrow Quill Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 24.</ref> According to his dream the tree, which was Osman's Empire, issued four rivers from its roots, the [[Tigris]], the [[Euphrates]], the [[Nile]] and the [[Danube]].<ref name=kin24/>  Additionally, the tree shaded four mountain ranges, the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]], the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] and the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan]] ranges.<ref name=kin24/> During his reign as Sultan, Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nDuring this period, a formal [[Ruling institution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] was created whose institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire.\n\nIn the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[History of the Balkans|Balkans]]. Osman's son, [[Orhan]], captured the city of [[Bursa]] in 1326 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern Anatolia. The important city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1387. The Ottoman victory at [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo in 1389]] effectively marked [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|the end of Serbian power]] in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale [[Crusades|crusade]] of the [[Middle Ages]], failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks. With the extension of Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic [[Sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|conquest of Constantinople]] became a crucial objective. The Empire controlled nearly all former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine lands]] surrounding the city, but the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] were temporarily relieved when [[Timur]] invaded Anatolia in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402. He took Sultan [[Bayezid I]] as a prisoner. The capture of Bayezid I threw the Turks into disorder. The state fell into a civil war that lasted from 1402 to 1413, as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when [[Mehmed I]] emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the [[Ottoman Interregnum|Interregnum]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Facial Chronicle - b.10, p.299 - Battle of Kosovo (1389).png|[[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo (1389)]]\nFile:Nicopol final battle 1398.jpg|[[Battle of Nicopolis|Battle of Nicopolis (1396)]]\nFile:Mehmet I honoraries miniature.jpg|Sultan [[Mehmed I]].

After taking Constantinople, Mehmed met with the Orthodox patriarch, Gennadios and worked out an arrangement in which the [[Orthodox Church]], in exchange for being able to maintain its autonomy and land, accepted Ottoman authority.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Stone, Norman \"Turkey in the Russian Mirror\" pages 86\u2013100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 page 94</ref> Because of bad relations between the latter Byzantine Empire and the states of western Europe as epitomized by [[Loukas Notaras]]'s famous remark \"Better the Sultan's turban than the Cardinal's Hat\", the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nUpon making Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]) the new capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed II assumed the title of ''Kayser-i R\u00fbm'' (literally ''Caesar Romanus'', i.e. Roman Emperor.) In order to consolidate this claim, he would launch a campaign to conquer Rome, the western capital of the former [[Roman Empire]]. To this aim he spent many years securing positions on the [[Adriatic Sea]], such as in [[Albania Veneta]], and then continued with the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and [[Apulia]] on 28 July 1480. The Turks stayed in [[Otranto]] and its surrounding areas for nearly a year, but after Mehmed II's death on 3 May 1481, plans for penetrating deeper into the [[Italian peninsula]] with fresh new reinforcements were given up on and cancelled and the remaining Ottoman troops sailed back to the east of the Adriatic Sea.\n\n[[File:Yavuz Sultan I.

Conquests on land were driven by the discipline and innovation of the Ottoman military; and on the sea, the Ottoman Navy aided this expansion significantly. The navy also contested and protected key seagoing trade routes, in competition with the Italian city states in the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] seas and the Portuguese in the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe state also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Karpat, Kemal H. |title=The Ottoman state and its place in world history |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=111 |isbn=90-04-03945-7 |oclc= }}. A lock-hold on trade between western Europe and Asia is often cited as a primary motivation for [[Isabella I of Castile]] to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s westward journey to find a sailing route to Asia and, more generally, for European seafaring nations to explore alternative trade routes (e.g. K. D. Madan, ''Life and travels of Vasco Da Gama'' (1998), 9; I. Stavans, ''Imagining Columbus: the literary voyage'' (2001), 5; W.B. Wheeler and S. Becker, ''Discovering the American Past. A Look at the Evidence: to 1877'' (2006), 105). This traditional viewpoint has been attacked as unfounded in an influential article by A.H.

In the east, the Ottoman Turks took [[Baghdad]] from the Persians in 1535, gaining control of [[Mesopotamia]] and naval access to the [[Persian Gulf]].

[[Early Modern France|France]] and the Ottoman Empire, united by mutual opposition to Habsburg rule in both Southern and Central Europe, became strong allies during this period. The alliance was economic and military, as the sultans granted France the right of trade within the Empire without levy of taxation. By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a significant and accepted part of the European political sphere. It made a military alliance with France, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] against [[Habsburg Spain]], Italy and [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]].\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] policy of expansion throughout the Mediterranean basin was however halted in [[Malta]] in 1565. During a summer-long siege which was later to be known as the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]], the Ottoman forces which numbered around 50,000 fought the [[Knights of St. John]] and the Maltese garrison of 6000 men.  Stubborn resistance by the Maltese led to the lifting of the siege in September. The unsuccessful siege (the Turks managed to capture the Isle of [[Gozo]] together with [[Fort Saint Elmo]] on the main island of Malta, but failed elsewhere and retreated) was the second and last defeat experienced by Suleiman the Magnificent after the likewise inconclusive [[Siege of Vienna|first Ottoman siege of Vienna]] in 1529. Suleiman I died of natural causes in his tent during the [[Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r]] in 1566. The [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 (which was triggered by the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|Ottoman capture of Venetian-controlled Cyprus]] in 1570) was another major setback for Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, despite the fact that an equally large Ottoman fleet was built in a short time and [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunisia was recovered from Spain]] in 1574.\n\nAs the 16th century progressed, Ottoman naval superiority was challenged by the growing sea powers of western Europe, particularly Portugal, in the [[Persian Gulf]], Indian Ocean and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. With the Ottoman Turks blockading sea-lanes to the East and South, the European powers were driven to find another way to the ancient silk and spice routes, now under Ottoman control. On land, the Empire was preoccupied by [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars|military campaigns in Austria]] and Persia, two widely separated theatres of war. The strain of these conflicts on the Empire's resources, and the logistics of maintaining lines of supply and communication across such vast distances, ultimately rendered its sea efforts unsustainable and unsuccessful. The overriding military need for defence on the western and eastern frontiers of the Empire eventually made effective long-term engagement on a global scale impossible.{{Citation needed|date = July 2011}}\n\n==Transformation of the Ottoman Empire (1566\u20131700)==\n{{main|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{further|Ottoman Decline Thesis}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{one source|section|date=September 2016}}{{unreliable sources|section|date=September 2016}}}}\n\n[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|180px|Ottoman miniature about the [[Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r|Szigetv\u00e1r campaign]] showing Ottoman troops and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] as avantgarde.]]\nEuropean states initiated efforts at this time to curb Ottoman control of the traditional overland trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe, which started with the [[Silk Road]]. Western European states began to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly by establishing their own maritime routes to Asia [[Age of Discovery|through new discoveries at sea]]. The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488 initiated [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars]] in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. Economically, the [[Price Revolution]] caused rampant inflation in both Europe and the Middle East. This had serious negative consequences at all levels of Ottoman society.\n\nThe expansion of [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovite Russia]] under [[Ivan IV]] (1533\u20131584) into the Volga and Caspian region at the expense of the Tatar khanates disrupted the northern pilgrimage and trade routes. A highly ambitious plan to counter this conceived by [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], Grand Vizier under [[Selim II]], in the shape of a Don-Volga canal (begun June 1569), combined with an attack on Astrakhan, failed, the canal being abandoned with the onset of winter.

Their victory over the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] was a startling blow to the image of Ottoman invincibility. However, historians today stress the symbolic and not the strictly military significance of the battle, for within six months of the defeat a new Ottoman fleet of some 250 sail including eight modern [[galleass]]es<ref name=\"Kinross, 272\">Kinross, 272.</ref> had been built, with the shipyards of Istanbul turning out a new ship every day at the height of the construction. In discussions with a Venetian minister, the Ottoman Grand Vizier commented: \"In capturing Cyprus from you, we have cut off one of your arms; in defeating our fleet you have merely shaved off our beard\".<ref name=\"Kinross, 272\"/> The Ottoman naval recovery persuaded Venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, and the Ottomans were able to expand and consolidate their position in North Africa.<ref>Itzkowitz, p. 67.</ref> However, what could not be replaced were the experienced naval officers and sailors. The Battle of Lepanto was far more damaging to the Ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships, which were rapidly replaced.<ref>Kunt & Woodhead (Ed.) ''Suleyman The Magnificent and his Age, The Ottoman Empire in the Early Modern World'' (Longman 1995) p. 53</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the [[Habsburg]] frontier had settled into a reasonably permanent border, marked only by relatively minor battles concentrating on the possession of individual fortresses. The stalemate was caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences<ref>Itzkowitz,  p. 71</ref> and reflected simple geographical limits: in the pre-mechanized age, [[Vienna]] marked the furthest point that an Ottoman army could march from Istanbul during the early spring to late autumn campaigning season. It also reflected the difficulties imposed on the Empire by the need to support two separate fronts: one against the Austrians (see: [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]), and the other against a rival Islamic state, the [[Safavid]]s of Persia (see: [[Ottoman wars in Near East]]).\n\n[[File:Mehmed III.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mehmed III]]'s armies defeated the [[Habsburg]] and [[Transylvania]]n forces at the [[Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes|Battle of Keresztes]].]]\nChanges in European military tactics and weaponry in the [[military revolution]] caused the [[Sipahi]] cavalry to lose military relevance. The [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] against Austria (1593\u20131606) created the need for greater numbers of infantry equipped with firearms. This resulted in a relaxation of recruitment policy and a significant growth in [[Janissary]] corps numbers. Irregular sharpshooters (Sekban) were also recruited for the same reasons and on demobilization turned to brigandage in the [[Jelali revolts]] (1595\u20131610), which engendered widespread anarchy in Anatolia in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.<ref>Inalcik, Halil.

The most prominent women of this period were [[K\u00f6sem Sultan]] and her daughter-in-law [[Turhan Hatice]], whose political rivalry culminated in K\u00f6sem's murder in 1651.<ref>Itzkowitz, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\n[[File:A t\u00f6r\u00f6k kori Esztergom l\u00e1tk\u00e9pe.

On 15 September 1656 the octogenarian [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] accepted the seals of office having received guarantees from the Valide [[Turhan Hatice]] of unprecedented authority and freedom from interference. A fierce conservative disciplinarian, he successfully reasserted the central authority and the empire's military impetus. This continued under his son and successor [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed]] (Grand Vizier 1661\u20131676).<ref>Itzkowitz, pp. 77\u201381.</ref> The K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Vizierate saw renewed military success with authority restored in [[Transylvania]], the conquest of [[Crete]] completed in 1669 and expansion into Polish southern [[Ukraine]], with the strongholds of [[Khotyn]] and [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]] and the territory of [[Podolia]] ceding to Ottoman control in 1676.<ref>Itzkowitz,  pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\n\nThis period of renewed assertiveness came to a calamitous end when Grand Vizier [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]] in May 1683 led a huge army to attempt a second Ottoman siege of Vienna in the [[Great Turkish War]] of 1683\u20131699. The final assault being fatally delayed, the Ottoman forces were swept away by allied Habsburg, German and Polish forces spearheaded by the Polish king [[John III Sobieski|Jan]]<ref>Itzkowitz, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> at the\n[[Battle of Vienna]].\n\nThe alliance of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] pressed home the advantage of the defeat at Vienna and, thus, fifteen (15) years of see-sawing warfare, culminated in the epochal [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] (26 January 1699), which ended the Great Turkish War.<ref>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', p. 357.</ref>  For the first time, the Ottoman Empire surrendered control of significant European territories (many permanently), including [[Ottoman Hungary]].<ref>Itzkowitz, p. 84.</ref> The Empire had reached the end of its ability to effectively conduct an assertive, expansionist policy against its European rivals and it was to be forced from this point to adopt an essentially defensive strategy within this theatre.\n\nOnly two Sultans in this period personally exercised strong political and military control of the Empire: the vigorous [[Murad IV]] (1612\u20131640) recaptured [[Yerevan]] (1635) and Baghdad (1639) from the [[Safavids]] and reasserted central authority, albeit during a brief majority reign.

These efforts, however, were hampered by reactionary movements, partly from the religious leadership, but primarily from the Janissary corps, who had become anarchic and ineffectual. Jealous of their privileges and firmly opposed to change, they created a [[Janissary revolts|Janissary revolt]]. Selim's efforts cost him his throne and his life, but were resolved in spectacular and bloody fashion by his successor, the dynamic [[Mahmud II]], who eliminated the [[Janissary]] corps in 1826.\n\nThe [[Serbian revolution]] (1804\u20131815) marked the beginning of an era of [[Romantic nationalism|national awakening]] in the [[Balkans]] during the [[Eastern Question]].

By the mid-19th century, the Ottoman Empire was called the [[Sick man of Europe|\"sick man\"]] by Europeans. The [[suzerainty|suzerain states]] \u2013 the [[Principality of Serbia]], Wallachia, [[Moldavia]] and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]] \u2013 moved towards ''de jure'' independence during the 1860s and 1870s.\n\n==Decline and modernization (1828\u20131908)==\n{{main|Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire}}\nDuring this period, the empire faced challenges in defending itself against foreign invasion and occupation. The empire ceased to enter conflicts on its own and began to forge alliances with European countries such as France, the Netherlands, Britain and Russia. As an example, in the 1853 [[Crimean War]], the Ottomans united with Britain, [[Second French Empire|France]] and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].\n\n===Modernization===\n[[Image:Sultan Mahmud II.jpg|thumb|[[Mahmud II]] started the modernization of Turkey by paving the way for the Edict of [[Tanzimat]] in 1839.]]\nDuring the [[Tanzimat]] period (from Arabic: \u062a\u0646\u0638\u064a\u0645 ''tan\u1e93\u012bm'', meaning \"organisation\") (1839\u201376), the government's series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law<ref>http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf</ref> and [[guild]]s with modern factories. In 1856, the ''[[Hatt-\u0131 H\u00fcmayun]]'' promised equality for all Ottoman citizens regardless of their ethnicity and religious confession; which thus widened the scope of the 1839 [[Hatt-i Sharif|''Hatt-\u0131 \u015eerif'' of G\u00fclhane]].\n\nOverall, the Tanzimat reforms had far-reaching effects. Those educated in the schools established during the Tanzimat period included [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]] and other progressive leaders and thinkers of the [[Republic of Turkey]] and of many other former Ottoman states in the [[Balkans]], the Middle East and North Africa.

It established the freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. The empire's [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional era]], was short-lived. But the idea of [[Ottomanism]] proved influential. A group of reformers known as the [[Young Ottomans]], primarily educated in [[Western world|Western]] universities, believed that a [[constitutional monarchy]] would give an answer to the empire's growing social unrest. Through a [[military coup]] in 1876, they forced Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (1861\u20131876) to abdicate in favour of [[Murad V]]. However, Murad V was mentally ill and was deposed within a few months. His heir-apparent, [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] (1876\u20131909), was invited to assume power on the condition that he would declare a constitutional monarchy, which he did on 23 November 1876. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. When forced to reconvene it, he abolished the representative body instead.

While this era was not without some successes, the ability of the Ottoman state to have any effect on ethnic uprisings was seriously called into question.\n\n[[Image:Punch - The Dogs of War.png|thumb|225px|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from 17 June 1876.

By 1817, when the revolution ended, Serbia was raised to the status of [[Principality of Serbia|self-governing monarchy]] under nominal Ottoman [[suzerainty]].<ref>English translation: Leopold Ranke, A History of Serbia and the Serbian Revolution.

In 1875, the tributary principalities of Serbia and [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], and the [[United Principalities]] of [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], unilaterally declared their independence from the empire. Following the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878]], the empire granted independence to all three belligerent nations. [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] also achieved independence<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Treaty-of-San-Stefano|title=Treaty of San Stefano {{!}} Russia-Turkey [1878]|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}</ref> (as the [[Principality of Bulgaria]]); its volunteers had participated in the Russo-Turkish War on the side of the rebelling nations.\n\n====Congress of Berlin====\n[[File:Map-of-Ottoman-Empire-in-1900-German.svg|thumb|left|Map of the Ottoman Empire in 1900,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/europe_map_1900.jpg |title=Map of Europe and the Ottoman Empire in the year 1900 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}</ref> with the names of the Ottoman provinces between 1878 and 1908.]]\n\nThe [[Congress of Berlin]] (13 June \u2013 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the leading statesmen of Europe's Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire. In the wake of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]] that ended with a decisive victory for Russia and her Orthodox Christian allies (subjects of the Ottoman Empire before the war) in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]], the urgent need was to stabilise and reorganise the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimise the risks of major war, while recognising the reduced power of the Ottomans, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers.\n\nAs a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria lost [[Eastern Rumelia]], which was restored to the Turks under a special administration; and Macedonia, which was returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform. [[Romania]] achieved full independence, but had to turn over part of [[Bessarabia]] to Russia. [[History of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories.\n\nIn 1878, [[Austria-Hungary]] unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]], but the Ottoman government contested this move and maintained its troops in both provinces. The stalemate lasted for 30 years (Austrian and Ottoman forces coexisted in Bosnia and Novi Pazar for three decades) until 1908, when the Austrians took advantage of the political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire that stemmed from the [[Young Turk Revolution]] and [[Bosnian crisis|annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina]], but pulled their troops out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise and avoid a war with the Turks.\n\nIn return for British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s advocacy for restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the Congress of Berlin, Britain assumed the administration of [[Cyprus]] in 1878<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918'' (1954) pp 228\u201354</ref> and later sent troops to [[Egypt]] in 1882 with the pretext of helping the Ottoman government to put down the [[Urabi Revolt]]; effectively gaining control in both territories (Britain formally annexed the still nominally Ottoman territories of Cyprus and Egypt on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman Empire's decision to enter World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]].) France, on its part, occupied [[Tunisia]] in 1881.\n\nThe results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into [[world war]] in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, called at the time the \"sick man of Europe\", was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. Austria gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria in the Balkans.<ref>Jerome L. Blum, et al. ''The European World: A History'' (1970) p 841</ref>\n\nIn the long-run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress succeeded in keeping Istanbul in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], most notably [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 led to the [[First Balkan War]] in which the Turks were defeated and lost nearly all of Europe. As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the empire's remaining territory in the Balkans or to the heartland in Anatolia.<ref>Mann, Michael (2005), ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', Cambridge University Press, p. 118</ref><ref>Todorova, Maria (2009), ''Imagining the Balkans'', Oxford University Press, p. 175</ref> Muslims had been the majority in some parts of the Ottoman Empire such as the Crimea, the Balkans and the Caucasus as well as a plurality in southern Russia and also in some parts of Romania.

In April 1882, British and French warships appeared in [[Alexandria]] to support the [[khedive]] and prevent the country from falling into the hands of anti-European nationals. In August 1882 British forces invaded and occupied [[Egypt]] on the pretext of bringing order. The British supported [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tewfiq]] and restored stability with was especially beneficial to British and French financial interests. [[List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty#Khedivate (1867\u20131914)|Egypt and Sudan]] remained as Ottoman provinces ''[[de jure]]'' until 1914, when the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Central Powers]] of World War I. Great Britain officially annexed these two provinces and [[Cyprus]] in response. Other Ottoman provinces in North Africa were lost between 1830 and 1912, starting with [[Algeria]] (occupied by France in 1830), [[Tunisia]] (occupied by France in 1881) and [[Libya]] (occupied by Italy in 1912).\n\n===Armenians===\n{{main|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire}}\nAlthough granted their own [[Armenian National Constitution|constitution]] and [[Armenian National Assembly (Ottoman Empire)|national assembly]] with the Tanzimat reforms, the Armenians attempted to demand implementation of Article 61 from the Ottoman government as agreed upon at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hovannisian | first1 = Richard G. | title = The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire, 1876\u20131914 | url = | journal = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II | page = 218 }}</ref> Following pressure from the European powers and Armenians, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in response, assigned the Hamidiye regiments to eastern Anatolia (Ottoman Armenia).<ref>Hovannisian, 217,222.</ref> These were formed mostly of irregular [[cavalry]] units of recruited [[Kurds]].<ref>Hovannisian. \"The Armenian Question\", p. 217.</ref> From 1894\u201396, between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]].<ref>[[Taner Akcam|Akcam, Taner]].

It still controlled 28 million people, of whom 17 million were in modern-day Turkey, 3 million in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and 2.5 million in Iraq. Another 5.5 million people were under nominal Ottoman rule in the Arabian peninsula.<ref>\u015eevket Pamuk, \"The Ottoman Economy in World War I\" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds.

It marked the beginning of the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]]. This era is dominated by the politics of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), and the movement that would become known as the [[Young Turks]]. Although it began as a uniting progressive party, the CUP splintered in 1911 with the founding of the opposition [[Freedom and Accord Party]] (Liberal Union or Entente), which poached many of the more liberal [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Deputies]] from the CUP. The remaining CUP members, who now took a more dominantly nationalist tone in the face of the enmity of the [[Balkan Wars]], dueled Freedom and Accord in a series of power reversals, which ultimately led to the CUP (specifically its leadership, the \"[[Three Pashas]]\") seizing power from the Freedom and Accord in the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat]] and establishing total dominance over Ottoman politics until the end of World War I.\n\nProfiting from the civil strife, [[Austria-Hungary]] officially annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, but pulled its troops out of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], another contested region between the Austrians and Ottomans, to avoid a war.  During the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911\u201312) in which the Ottoman Empire lost [[Libya]], the [[Balkan League]] declared war against the Ottoman Empire. The Empire lost the  [[Balkan Wars]] (1912\u201313). It lost its [[Balkan peninsula|Balkan]] territories except [[East Thrace]] and the historic Ottoman capital city of [[Adrianople]] during the war. Some 400,000 Muslims, out of fear of Greek, Serbian or Bulgarian atrocities, left with the retreating Ottoman army.<ref>{{Cite journal|place=NL |format=PDF |url=http://tulp.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/wap/ejz18.pdf |title=Greek and Turkish refugees and deportees 1912\u20131924 |publisher=[[Universiteit Leiden]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716155929/http://tulp.leidenuniv.nl/content_docs/wap/ejz18.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-16 }}</ref> The [[Baghdad Railway]] under German control was a proposal to build rail lines into Iraq.

When the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918, the only parts of the [[Arabian peninsula]] that were still under Ottoman control were [[Yemen]], [[Asir]], the city of [[Medina]], portions of northern [[Syria]] and portions of northern [[Iraq]]. These territories were handed over to the British forces on 23 January 1919. The Ottomans were also forced to evacuate the parts of the former Russian Empire in the Caucasus (in present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]]), which they had gained towards the end of World War I, following Russia's retreat from the war with the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was solidified.

As sultan [[Mehmed II]] conquered [[Constantinople]] (today named [[Istanbul]]) in 1453, the state grew into a mighty empire, expanding deeply into Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. The Empire reached its apex under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the 16th century when it stretched from the [[Persian Gulf]] in the east to [[Algeria]] in the west; and from [[Yemen]] in the south to [[Hungary]] and parts of [[Ukraine]] in the north. From 1699 onwards, the Ottoman Empire began to lose territory over the course of the next two centuries due to internal stagnation, costly defensive wars, European colonialism, and nationalist revolts among its multiethnic subjects. The empire came to an end in the aftermath of its defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in [[World War I]]. The empire was officially abolished by the [[Government of the Grand National Assembly|Government of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ankara]] in November 1922 following the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish War of Independence (1919\u201323)]].\n\n==Rise of the Ottoman Empire (1299\u20131490)==\n{{Main|Rise of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{further|Ottoman Dynasty|Gaza Thesis}}\n\nWith the demise of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]] (c. 1300), [[Anatolia]] was divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called [[Anatolian Beyliks]]. By 1300, a weakened [[Byzantine Empire]] had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by [[Osman I]] (d. 1323/4), from which the name Ottoman is derived, son of [[Ertu\u011frul]], around [[Eski\u015fehir]] in western Anatolia. In the foundation myth expressed in the story known as \"[[Osman's Dream]]\", the young Osman was inspired to conquest by a prescient vision of empire (according to his dream, the empire is a big tree whose roots spread through three continents and whose branches cover the sky).<ref name=kin24>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'' (Morrow Quill Publishers: New York, 1977) p. 24.</ref> According to his dream the tree, which was Osman's Empire, issued four rivers from its roots, the [[Tigris]], the [[Euphrates]], the [[Nile]] and the [[Danube]].<ref name=kin24/>  Additionally, the tree shaded four mountain ranges, the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], the [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]], the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] and the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan]] ranges.<ref name=kin24/> During his reign as Sultan, Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nDuring this period, a formal [[Ruling institution of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] was created whose institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire.\n\nIn the century after the death of Osman I, Ottoman rule began to extend over the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[History of the Balkans|Balkans]]. Osman's son, [[Orhan]], captured the city of [[Bursa]] in 1326 and made it the new capital of the Ottoman state. The fall of Bursa meant the loss of Byzantine control over Northwestern Anatolia. The important city of [[Thessaloniki]] was captured from the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] in 1387. The Ottoman victory at [[Battle of Kosovo|Kosovo in 1389]] effectively marked [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|the end of Serbian power]] in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into Europe. The [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, widely regarded as the last large-scale [[Crusades|crusade]] of the [[Middle Ages]], failed to stop the advance of the victorious Ottoman Turks. With the extension of Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic [[Sieges of Constantinople#Ottoman Sieges|conquest of Constantinople]] became a crucial objective. The Empire controlled nearly all former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine lands]] surrounding the city, but the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] were temporarily relieved when [[Timur]] invaded Anatolia in the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402. He took Sultan [[Bayezid I]] as a prisoner. The capture of Bayezid I threw the Turks into disorder. The state fell into a civil war that lasted from 1402 to 1413, as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when [[Mehmed I]] emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the [[Ottoman Interregnum|Interregnum]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Facial Chronicle - b.10, p.299 - Battle of Kosovo (1389).png|[[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo (1389)]]\nFile:Nicopol final battle 1398.jpg|[[Battle of Nicopolis|Battle of Nicopolis (1396)]]\nFile:Mehmet I honoraries miniature.jpg|Sultan [[Mehmed I]].

On 10 November 1444, Murad II defeated the [[Hungary|Hungarian]], [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Wallachia]]n armies under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw III of Poland]] (also King of Hungary) and [[John Hunyadi|J\u00e1nos Hunyadi]] at the [[Battle of Varna]], which was the final battle of the [[Crusade of Varna]].<ref>Bodnar, Edward W.

After taking Constantinople, Mehmed met with the Orthodox patriarch, Gennadios and worked out an arrangement in which the [[Orthodox Church]], in exchange for being able to maintain its autonomy and land, accepted Ottoman authority.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Stone, Norman \"Turkey in the Russian Mirror\" pages 86\u2013100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 page 94</ref> Because of bad relations between the latter Byzantine Empire and the states of western Europe as epitomized by [[Loukas Notaras]]'s famous remark \"Better the Sultan's turban than the Cardinal's Hat\", the majority of the Orthodox population accepted Ottoman rule as preferable to Venetian rule.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nUpon making Constantinople (present-day [[Istanbul]]) the new capital of the Ottoman Empire in 1453, Mehmed II assumed the title of ''Kayser-i R\u00fbm'' (literally ''Caesar Romanus'', i.e. Roman Emperor.) In order to consolidate this claim, he would launch a campaign to conquer Rome, the western capital of the former [[Roman Empire]]. To this aim he spent many years securing positions on the [[Adriatic Sea]], such as in [[Albania Veneta]], and then continued with the [[Ottoman invasion of Otranto]] and [[Apulia]] on 28 July 1480. The Turks stayed in [[Otranto]] and its surrounding areas for nearly a year, but after Mehmed II's death on 3 May 1481, plans for penetrating deeper into the [[Italian peninsula]] with fresh new reinforcements were given up on and cancelled and the remaining Ottoman troops sailed back to the east of the Adriatic Sea.\n\n[[File:Yavuz Sultan I.

Conquests on land were driven by the discipline and innovation of the Ottoman military; and on the sea, the Ottoman Navy aided this expansion significantly. The navy also contested and protected key seagoing trade routes, in competition with the Italian city states in the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] seas and the Portuguese in the [[Red Sea]] and [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe state also flourished economically due to its control of the major overland trade routes between Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite book |author=Karpat, Kemal H. |title=The Ottoman state and its place in world history |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year=1974 |page=111 |isbn=90-04-03945-7 |oclc= }}. A lock-hold on trade between western Europe and Asia is often cited as a primary motivation for [[Isabella I of Castile]] to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s westward journey to find a sailing route to Asia and, more generally, for European seafaring nations to explore alternative trade routes (e.g. K. D. Madan, ''Life and travels of Vasco Da Gama'' (1998), 9; I. Stavans, ''Imagining Columbus: the literary voyage'' (2001), 5; W.B. Wheeler and S. Becker, ''Discovering the American Past. A Look at the Evidence: to 1877'' (2006), 105). This traditional viewpoint has been attacked as unfounded in an influential article by A.H. Lybyer (\"The Ottoman Turks and the Routes of Oriental Trade\", ''English Historical Review'', 120 (1915), 577\u2013588), who sees the rise of Ottoman power and the beginnings of Portuguese and Spanish explorations as unrelated events. His view has not been universally accepted (cf. K.M. Setton, ''The Papacy and the Levant (1204\u20131571), Vol. 2: The Fifteenth Century (Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 127)'' (1978), 335).</ref>\n\nThe Empire prospered under the rule of a line of committed and effective [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultans]]. Sultan [[Selim I]] (1512\u20131520) dramatically expanded the Empire's eastern and southern frontiers by defeating [[Ismail I|Shah Ismail]] of [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Persia]], in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Savory |first=R.

During the reign of Suleiman, [[Transylvania]], [[Wallachia]] and, intermittently, [[Moldavia]], became tributary principalities of the Ottoman Empire. In the east, the Ottoman Turks took [[Baghdad]] from the Persians in 1535, gaining control of [[Mesopotamia]] and naval access to the [[Persian Gulf]]. By the end of Suleiman's reign, the Empire's population totaled about 15,000,000 people.<ref name=\"Kinross206\">L.

Important naval victories of the Ottoman Empire in this period include the [[Battle of Preveza]] (1538); [[Battle of Ponza (1552)|Battle of Ponza]] (1552); [[Battle of Djerba]] (1560); conquest of [[Ottoman Algeria|Algiers]] (in [[Capture of Algiers (1516)|1516]] and [[Capture of Algiers (1529)|1529]]) and [[History of Ottoman-era Tunisia|Tunis]] (in [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|1534]] and [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|1574]]) from Spain; conquest of [[Siege of Rhodes (1522)|Rhodes (1522)]] and [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|Tripoli (1551)]] from the [[Knights of St. John]]; capture of [[Siege of Nice|Nice (1543)]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; capture of [[Invasion of Corsica (1553)|Corsica (1553)]] from the [[Republic of Genoa]]; capture of the [[Ottoman invasion of the Balearic Islands (1558)|Balearic Islands (1558)]] from Spain; capture of [[Capture of Aden (1548)|Aden (1548)]], [[Capture of Muscat (1552)|Muscat (1552)]] and [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh (1565\u201367)]] from Portugal during the [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean expeditions]]; among others.\n\nThe conquests of [[Siege of Nice|Nice (1543)]] and [[Invasion of Corsica (1553)|Corsica (1553)]] occurred on behalf of France as a joint venture between the forces of the French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and the Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], and were commanded by the Ottoman admirals [[Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]] and [[Turgut Reis]].<ref>Imber, 53.</ref> A month prior to the siege of Nice, France supported the Ottomans with an artillery unit during the Ottoman [[siege of Esztergom (1543)|conquest of Esztergom]] in 1543. [[Early Modern France|France]] and the Ottoman Empire, united by mutual opposition to Habsburg rule in both Southern and Central Europe, became strong allies during this period. The alliance was economic and military, as the sultans granted France the right of trade within the Empire without levy of taxation. By this time, the Ottoman Empire was a significant and accepted part of the European political sphere. It made a military alliance with France, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] against [[Habsburg Spain]], Italy and [[Archduchy of Austria|Habsburg Austria]].\n\n[[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] policy of expansion throughout the Mediterranean basin was however halted in [[Malta]] in 1565. During a summer-long siege which was later to be known as the [[Siege of Malta (1565)|Siege of Malta]], the Ottoman forces which numbered around 50,000 fought the [[Knights of St. John]] and the Maltese garrison of 6000 men.  Stubborn resistance by the Maltese led to the lifting of the siege in September. The unsuccessful siege (the Turks managed to capture the Isle of [[Gozo]] together with [[Fort Saint Elmo]] on the main island of Malta, but failed elsewhere and retreated) was the second and last defeat experienced by Suleiman the Magnificent after the likewise inconclusive [[Siege of Vienna|first Ottoman siege of Vienna]] in 1529. Suleiman I died of natural causes in his tent during the [[Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r]] in 1566. The [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571 (which was triggered by the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|Ottoman capture of Venetian-controlled Cyprus]] in 1570) was another major setback for Ottoman naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, despite the fact that an equally large Ottoman fleet was built in a short time and [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunisia was recovered from Spain]] in 1574.\n\nAs the 16th century progressed, Ottoman naval superiority was challenged by the growing sea powers of western Europe, particularly Portugal, in the [[Persian Gulf]], Indian Ocean and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. With the Ottoman Turks blockading sea-lanes to the East and South, the European powers were driven to find another way to the ancient silk and spice routes, now under Ottoman control. On land, the Empire was preoccupied by [[Ottoman-Habsburg wars|military campaigns in Austria]] and Persia, two widely separated theatres of war. The strain of these conflicts on the Empire's resources, and the logistics of maintaining lines of supply and communication across such vast distances, ultimately rendered its sea efforts unsustainable and unsuccessful. The overriding military need for defence on the western and eastern frontiers of the Empire eventually made effective long-term engagement on a global scale impossible.{{Citation needed|date = July 2011}}\n\n==Transformation of the Ottoman Empire (1566\u20131700)==\n{{main|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{further|Ottoman Decline Thesis}}\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{one source|section|date=September 2016}}{{unreliable sources|section|date=September 2016}}}}\n\n[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|180px|Ottoman miniature about the [[Siege of Szigetv\u00e1r|Szigetv\u00e1r campaign]] showing Ottoman troops and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]] as avantgarde.]]\nEuropean states initiated efforts at this time to curb Ottoman control of the traditional overland trade routes between East Asia and Western Europe, which started with the [[Silk Road]]. Western European states began to avoid the Ottoman trade monopoly by establishing their own maritime routes to Asia [[Age of Discovery|through new discoveries at sea]]. The [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] discovery of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488 initiated [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|a series of Ottoman-Portuguese naval wars]] in the Indian Ocean throughout the 16th century. Economically, the [[Price Revolution]] caused rampant inflation in both Europe and the Middle East. This had serious negative consequences at all levels of Ottoman society.\n\nThe expansion of [[Tsardom of Russia|Muscovite Russia]] under [[Ivan IV]] (1533\u20131584) into the Volga and Caspian region at the expense of the Tatar khanates disrupted the northern pilgrimage and trade routes. A highly ambitious plan to counter this conceived by [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], Grand Vizier under [[Selim II]], in the shape of a Don-Volga canal (begun June 1569), combined with an attack on Astrakhan, failed, the canal being abandoned with the onset of winter.

Their victory over the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]] was a startling blow to the image of Ottoman invincibility. However, historians today stress the symbolic and not the strictly military significance of the battle, for within six months of the defeat a new Ottoman fleet of some 250 sail including eight modern [[galleass]]es<ref name=\"Kinross, 272\">Kinross, 272.</ref> had been built, with the shipyards of Istanbul turning out a new ship every day at the height of the construction. In discussions with a Venetian minister, the Ottoman Grand Vizier commented: \"In capturing Cyprus from you, we have cut off one of your arms; in defeating our fleet you have merely shaved off our beard\".<ref name=\"Kinross, 272\"/> The Ottoman naval recovery persuaded Venice to sign a peace treaty in 1573, and the Ottomans were able to expand and consolidate their position in North Africa.<ref>Itzkowitz, p. 67.</ref> However, what could not be replaced were the experienced naval officers and sailors. The Battle of Lepanto was far more damaging to the Ottoman navy in sapping experienced manpower than the loss of ships, which were rapidly replaced.<ref>Kunt & Woodhead (Ed.)

The stalemate was caused by a stiffening of the Habsburg defences<ref>Itzkowitz,  p. 71</ref> and reflected simple geographical limits: in the pre-mechanized age, [[Vienna]] marked the furthest point that an Ottoman army could march from Istanbul during the early spring to late autumn campaigning season. It also reflected the difficulties imposed on the Empire by the need to support two separate fronts: one against the Austrians (see: [[Ottoman wars in Europe]]), and the other against a rival Islamic state, the [[Safavid]]s of Persia (see: [[Ottoman wars in Near East]]).\n\n[[File:Mehmed III.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mehmed III]]'s armies defeated the [[Habsburg]] and [[Transylvania]]n forces at the [[Battle of Mez\u0151keresztes|Battle of Keresztes]].]]\nChanges in European military tactics and weaponry in the [[military revolution]] caused the [[Sipahi]] cavalry to lose military relevance.

This resulted in a relaxation of recruitment policy and a significant growth in [[Janissary]] corps numbers.

This was not wholly unprecedented; [[Roxelana|H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], who established herself in the early 1530s as the successor of [[Nurbanu]], the first [[Valide Sultan]], was described by the Venetian [[Bailo of Constantinople|baylo]] Andrea Giritti as \"a woman of the utmost goodness, courage and wisdom\" even though she \"thwarted some while rewarding others\".<ref>Leslie P.

On 15 September 1656 the octogenarian [[K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha]] accepted the seals of office having received guarantees from the Valide [[Turhan Hatice]] of unprecedented authority and freedom from interference. A fierce conservative disciplinarian, he successfully reasserted the central authority and the empire's military impetus.

The Empire began to improve the fortifications of its cities in the Balkan peninsula to act as a defence against European expansionism. Cultural works, fine arts and architecture flourished, with more elaborate styles that were influenced by the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] movements in Europe. A classic example is the [[Fountain of Ahmed III]] in front of the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace]].

By this period, though, the influences had become regressive and conservative. In 1734, when an artillery school was established with French teachers in order to impart Western-style artillery methods, the Islamic clergy successfully objected under the grounds of [[theodicy]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Stone, Norman \"Turkey in the Russian Mirror\" pages 86\u2013100 from ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy'' edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 page 97</ref> Not until 1754 was the artillery school reopened on a semi-secret basis.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Earlier, the [[guilds]] of writers had denounced the [[printing press]] as \"the Devil's Invention\", and were responsible for a 53-year lag between its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in Europe in c. 1440 and its introduction to the Ottoman society with the first Gutenberg press in Istanbul that was established by the [[Sephardic Jews]] of Spain in 1493 (who had migrated to the Ottoman Empire a year earlier, escaping from the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1492.)

Under the pretext of pursuing fugitive Polish revolutionaries, Russian troops entered [[Balta, Odessa Oblast|Balta]] an Ottoman-controlled city on the border of Bessarabia and massacred its citizens and burned the town to the ground.<ref>Lord Kinross, ''The Ottoman Centuries'', p. 396.</ref>  This action provoked the Ottoman Empire into the First Russo-Turkish War of 1768\u20131774.

It established the freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. The empire's [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional era]], was short-lived. But the idea of [[Ottomanism]] proved influential. A group of reformers known as the [[Young Ottomans]], primarily educated in [[Western world|Western]] universities, believed that a [[constitutional monarchy]] would give an answer to the empire's growing social unrest. Through a [[military coup]] in 1876, they forced Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] (1861\u20131876) to abdicate in favour of [[Murad V]]. However, Murad V was mentally ill and was deposed within a few months. His heir-apparent, [[Abd\u00fclhamid II]] (1876\u20131909), was invited to assume power on the condition that he would declare a constitutional monarchy, which he did on 23 November 1876. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. When forced to reconvene it, he abolished the representative body instead. This ended the effectiveness of the ''[[Kan\u00fbn-\u0131 Es\u00e2s\u00ee]]''.\n\nThe Christian [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]] gained privileges, such as in the [[Armenian National Constitution]] of 1863.

Uprisings in Ottoman territory had many far-reaching consequences during the 19th century and determined much of Ottoman policy during the early 20th century. Many Ottoman Turks questioned whether the policies of the state were to blame: some felt that the sources of [[ethnic conflict]] were external, and unrelated to issues of governance. While this era was not without some successes, the ability of the Ottoman state to have any effect on ethnic uprisings was seriously called into question.\n\n[[Image:Punch - The Dogs of War.png|thumb|225px|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon from 17 June 1876.

In the wake of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]] that ended with a decisive victory for Russia and her Orthodox Christian allies (subjects of the Ottoman Empire before the war) in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]], the urgent need was to stabilise and reorganise the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimise the risks of major war, while recognising the reduced power of the Ottomans, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers.\n\nAs a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria lost [[Eastern Rumelia]], which was restored to the Turks under a special administration; and Macedonia, which was returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform. [[Romania]] achieved full independence, but had to turn over part of [[Bessarabia]] to Russia. [[History of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories.\n\nIn 1878, [[Austria-Hungary]] unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Novi Pazar]], but the Ottoman government contested this move and maintained its troops in both provinces. The stalemate lasted for 30 years (Austrian and Ottoman forces coexisted in Bosnia and Novi Pazar for three decades) until 1908, when the Austrians took advantage of the political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire that stemmed from the [[Young Turk Revolution]] and [[Bosnian crisis|annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina]], but pulled their troops out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise and avoid a war with the Turks.\n\nIn return for British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]]'s advocacy for restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the Congress of Berlin, Britain assumed the administration of [[Cyprus]] in 1878<ref>A. J. P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918'' (1954) pp 228\u201354</ref> and later sent troops to [[Egypt]] in 1882 with the pretext of helping the Ottoman government to put down the [[Urabi Revolt]]; effectively gaining control in both territories (Britain formally annexed the still nominally Ottoman territories of Cyprus and Egypt on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman Empire's decision to enter World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]].) France, on its part, occupied [[Tunisia]] in 1881.\n\nThe results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilisation. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into [[world war]] in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire, called at the time the \"sick man of Europe\", was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. Austria gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists, and found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria in the Balkans.<ref>Jerome L. Blum, et al. ''The European World: A History'' (1970) p 841</ref>\n\nIn the long-run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress succeeded in keeping Istanbul in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia's victory. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], most notably [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 led to the [[First Balkan War]] in which the Turks were defeated and lost nearly all of Europe. As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the empire's remaining territory in the Balkans or to the heartland in Anatolia.<ref>Mann, Michael (2005), ''The dark side of democracy: explaining ethnic cleansing'', Cambridge University Press, p. 118</ref><ref>Todorova, Maria (2009), ''Imagining the Balkans'', Oxford University Press, p. 175</ref> Muslims had been the majority in some parts of the Ottoman Empire such as the Crimea, the Balkans and the Caucasus as well as a plurality in southern Russia and also in some parts of Romania.

In April 1882, British and French warships appeared in [[Alexandria]] to support the [[khedive]] and prevent the country from falling into the hands of anti-European nationals. In August 1882 British forces invaded and occupied [[Egypt]] on the pretext of bringing order. The British supported [[Tewfik Pasha|Khedive Tewfiq]] and restored stability with was especially beneficial to British and French financial interests. [[List of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty#Khedivate (1867\u20131914)|Egypt and Sudan]] remained as Ottoman provinces ''[[de jure]]'' until 1914, when the Ottoman Empire joined the [[Central Powers]] of World War I. Great Britain officially annexed these two provinces and [[Cyprus]] in response. Other Ottoman provinces in North Africa were lost between 1830 and 1912, starting with [[Algeria]] (occupied by France in 1830), [[Tunisia]] (occupied by France in 1881) and [[Libya]] (occupied by Italy in 1912).\n\n===Armenians===\n{{main|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire}}\nAlthough granted their own [[Armenian National Constitution|constitution]] and [[Armenian National Assembly (Ottoman Empire)|national assembly]] with the Tanzimat reforms, the Armenians attempted to demand implementation of Article 61 from the Ottoman government as agreed upon at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hovannisian | first1 = Richard G. | title = The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire, 1876\u20131914 | url = | journal = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II | page = 218 }}</ref> Following pressure from the European powers and Armenians, Sultan Abdul Hamid II, in response, assigned the Hamidiye regiments to eastern Anatolia (Ottoman Armenia).<ref>Hovannisian, 217,222.</ref> These were formed mostly of irregular [[cavalry]] units of recruited [[Kurds]].<ref>Hovannisian. \"The Armenian Question\", p. 217.</ref> From 1894\u201396, between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians living throughout the empire were killed in what became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]].<ref>[[Taner Akcam|Akcam, Taner]].

It still controlled 28 million people, of whom 17 million were in modern-day Turkey, 3 million in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, and 2.5 million in Iraq. Another 5.5 million people were under nominal Ottoman rule in the Arabian peninsula.<ref>\u015eevket Pamuk, \"The Ottoman Economy in World War I\" in Stephen Broadberry and Mark Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) pp 112\u201336, esp. p 112</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]] began after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] (3 July 1908) with the sultan's announcement of the restoration of the [[:s:tr:Kanun-u Esasi|1876 constitution]] and the reconvening of the Ottoman Parliament. It marked the beginning of the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]]. This era is dominated by the politics of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP), and the movement that would become known as the [[Young Turks]]. Although it began as a uniting progressive party, the CUP splintered in 1911 with the founding of the opposition [[Freedom and Accord Party]] (Liberal Union or Entente), which poached many of the more liberal [[Chamber of Deputies (Ottoman Empire)|Deputies]] from the CUP. The remaining CUP members, who now took a more dominantly nationalist tone in the face of the enmity of the [[Balkan Wars]], dueled Freedom and Accord in a series of power reversals, which ultimately led to the CUP (specifically its leadership, the \"[[Three Pashas]]\") seizing power from the Freedom and Accord in the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'\u00e9tat]] and establishing total dominance over Ottoman politics until the end of World War I.\n\nProfiting from the civil strife, [[Austria-Hungary]] officially annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908, but pulled its troops out of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], another contested region between the Austrians and Ottomans, to avoid a war.

The Ottoman Empire entered World War I after the [[Pursuit of Goeben and Breslau|''Goeben'' and ''Breslau'' incident]], in which it gave safe harbour to two German ships that were fleeing British ships.

When the [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918, the only parts of the [[Arabian peninsula]] that were still under Ottoman control were [[Yemen]], [[Asir]], the city of [[Medina]], portions of northern [[Syria]] and portions of northern [[Iraq]]. These territories were handed over to the British forces on 23 January 1919. The Ottomans were also forced to evacuate the parts of the former Russian Empire in the Caucasus (in present-day [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]]), which they had gained towards the end of World War I, following Russia's retreat from the war with the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was solidified.

The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D.

He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he [[Siege of Tortosa (1148)|captured Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French, [[Anglo-Normans]] and Genoese crusaders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Islamic ===\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|The Near East in 1135. Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat.

The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch.

Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Along the west and southwest coasts is the Muwahid Caliphate. The Zangid Sultanate covers most of the southeast coast and the inland areas from the east coast, which is occupied by the Crusader States. The Byzantine Empire covers most of the northeast coast and inland areas. The center of the north coast is held by the Holy Roman Empire and the northwest coast is held by the kingdoms of France and Aragon.]]\n\nEach of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}} A new plan was made to attack [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=60}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Bunson, Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen|title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints| publisher = Our Sunday Visitor| location = Huntington|year=1998| isbn = 978-0-87973-588-3 |ref=CITEREFBunson1998 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Mrshall W. |last2=Setton  |first2=Kenneth M. | title =A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The First Hundred Years | location = Madison, Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1969 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Barraclough | title = The Origins of Modern Germany | year = 1984 | publisher = W.

Crusade}}\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n}}\nThe '''Second Crusade''' (1147\u20131150) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from Europe. The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques'' by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840)|alt=Painting of a group of men clustered around a seated man in armor wearing a crown. Kneeling before the seated man is another man, with a third man standing between the two men and pointing at the kneeling man.]]\nIn the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]], in the context of the [[Reconquista]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he [[Siege of Tortosa (1148)|captured Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French, [[Anglo-Normans]] and Genoese crusaders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Islamic ===\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|The Near East in 1135. Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat.

The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 272\u2013273}}\n\n=== Journey to Jerusalem ===\n[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch|alt= Painting of two men meeting in front of a city gate. Both men are in front of crowds of other people. The one on the left is bareheaded and holds his hat in one hand while he bows to the other figure, who is dressed in blue embroidered robes and wears a crown.]]\nThough delayed by storms, Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on 19 March; Amadeus of Savoy had died on [[Cyprus]] along the way. Louis was welcomed by Eleanor's uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, the Muslim city that functioned as the gateway to Edessa, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} During this period, there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor, which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 18, 54}} Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with Eleanor under arrest. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|pp= 49\u201350}} [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven\u00e7als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Along the west and southwest coasts is the Muwahid Caliphate. The Zangid Sultanate covers most of the southeast coast and the inland areas from the east coast, which is occupied by the Crusader States. The Byzantine Empire covers most of the northeast coast and inland areas. The center of the north coast is held by the Holy Roman Empire and the northwest coast is held by the kingdoms of France and Aragon.]]\n\nEach of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}} A new plan was made to attack [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=60}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Bunson, Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen|title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints| publisher = Our Sunday Visitor| location = Huntington|year=1998| isbn = 978-0-87973-588-3 |ref=CITEREFBunson1998 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Mrshall W. |last2=Setton  |first2=Kenneth M. | title =A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The First Hundred Years | location = Madison, Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1969 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Barraclough | title = The Origins of Modern Germany | year = 1984 | publisher = W.
