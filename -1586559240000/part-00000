It consisted of the ''[[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]]'' (army), the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy) and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force). The designation \"''Wehrmacht''\" replaced the previously used term ''[[Reichswehr]]'', and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to [[German re-armament|rearm Germany]] to a greater extent than the [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|pp=90\u2013119}}\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi rise to power]] in 1933, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s most overt and audacious moves was to establish the ''Wehrmacht'', a modern offensively-capable armed force, fulfilling the Nazi regime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours. This required the reinstatement of conscription, and massive investment and [[defense spending]] on the [[arms industry]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1994|pp=39\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power. In the early part of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the ''Wehrmacht'' employed combined arms tactics (close cover air-support, tanks, and infantry) to devastating effect in what became known as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (lightning war). Its campaigns in [[Battle of France|France (1940)]], the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union (1941)]], and [[North African Campaign|North Africa (1941/42)]] are regarded as acts of boldness.{{sfn|Van Creveld|1982|p=3}} At the same time, the far-flung advances strained the ''Wehrmacht's'' capacity to the breaking point, culminating in the first major defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] (1941); by late 1942, Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres. The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition, making the ''Wehrmacht's'' weaknesses in strategy, doctrine, and logistics readily apparent.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nClosely cooperating with the [[Schutzstaffel|''SS'']] and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the German armed forces committed numerous [[Wehrmacht war crimes|war crimes]], despite later denials and promotion of the [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht|myth of the clean ''Wehrmacht'']].{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=85\u2013108}} The majority of the war crimes were committed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, as part of the [[war of annihilation]] against the Soviet Union, [[the Holocaust]] and [[Nazi security warfare]].\n\nDuring the war about 18 million men served in the ''Wehrmacht''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} By the time the war ended in Europe in May 1945, German forces (consisting of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|''Heer'']], the [[Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', and [[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|foreign collaborateur units]]) \n== Origin ==\n===Etymology===\nThe German term ''\"Wehrmacht''\" stems from the compound word of {{lang-de|wehren}}, \"to defend\" and {{lang|de|Macht}}, \"power, force\".{{efn|See [[wikt:Wehrmacht#German|the Wiktionary article]] for more information.}} It has been used to describe any nation's armed forces; for example, ''Britische Wehrmacht'' meaning \"British Armed Forces\". The [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849 designated all German military forces as the \"German ''Wehrmacht''\", consisting of the ''Seemacht'' (sea force) and the ''Landmacht'' (land force).{{sfn|Huber|2000}} In 1919, the term ''Wehrmacht'' also appears in Article 47 of the [[Weimar Constitution]], establishing that: \"The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces [i.e. the ''Wehrmacht''] of the Reich\". From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', a name that was dropped in favor of ''Wehrmacht'' on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Strohn|2010|p=10}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-16108,_Vereidigung_von_Reichswehr-Soldaten_auf_Hitler.jpg|alt=|thumb|253x253px|''Reichswehr'' soldiers swearing the [[Hitler oath]] in August 1934]]\nIn January 1919, after [[World War I]] ended with the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice of 11 November 1918]], the armed forces were dubbed ''Friedensheer'' (peace army).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=60}} In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000-strong preliminary army, the ''Vorl\u00e4ufige Reichswehr''. The terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were announced in May, and in June, Germany signed the treaty that, among other terms, imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six [[battleship]]s, six [[cruiser]]s, and twelve [[destroyer]]s. [[Submarine]]s, [[tank]]s and heavy [[artillery]] were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved. A new post-war military, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', was established on 23 March 1921. [[Conscription|General conscription]] was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Craig|1980|pp=424\u2013432}}\n\nThe ''Reichswehr'' was limited to 115,000 men, and thus the armed forces, under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]], retained only the most capable officers. The American historians Alan Millet and [[Williamson Murray]] wrote \"In reducing the officers corps, Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies, such as war heroes and the nobility\".{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Seeckt's determination that the ''Reichswehr'' be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army, based upon, but very different from, the army that existed in World War I.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} In the 1920s, Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed, aggression, combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Though Seeckt retired in 1926, the army that went to war in 1939 was largely his creation.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=22}}\n\nGermany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty; nonetheless, Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early 1920s. These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority, tactical and strategic bombing and providing ground support. That the ''Luftwaffe'' did not develop a strategic bombing force in the 1930s was not due to a lack of interest, but because of economic limitations.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=33}} The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], a close prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet. Officers who believed in submarine warfare led by Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] were in a minority before 1939.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=37}}\n\nBy 1922, Germany had begun covertly circumventing the conditions of the Versailles treaty. A secret collaboration with the [[Soviet Union]] began after the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=131}} Major-General {{ill|Otto Hasse (General)|de|Otto Hasse (General)|lt=Otto Hasse}} traveled to Moscow in 1923 to further negotiate the terms. Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialization and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany. German tank and air-force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects.{{sfn|Zeidler|2006|pp=106\u2013111}} In 1924 a [[Lipetsk fighter-pilot school|fighter-pilot school]] was established at [[Lipetsk]], where several hundred German air force personnel received instruction in operational maintenance, navigation, and aerial combat training over the next decade until the Germans finally left in September 1933.{{sfn|Cooper|1981|pp=382\u2013383}} However, the arms buildup was done in secrecy, until Hitler came to power and it received broad political support.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=10}}\n\n== Nazi rise to power ==\n{{further|Nazism and the Wehrmacht|German re-armament}}\nAfter the death of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 2 August 1934, [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed the office of [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President of Germany]], and thus became commander in chief. In February 1934, the Defence Minister [[Werner von Blomberg]], acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the armed forces adopt [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] into their uniforms in May 1934.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} In August of the same year, on Blomberg's initiative and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took the [[Hitler oath]], an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler. Hitler was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false.{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} The oath read: \"I swear by God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German empire and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath\".{{sfn|Broszat|Buchheim|Jacobsen|Krausnick|1999|p=18}}\n\nBy 1935, Germany was openly flouting the military restrictions set forth in the Versailles Treaty: [[German re-armament]] was announced on 16 March with the \"Edict for the Buildup of the ''Wehrmacht''\" ({{lang-de|Gesetz f\u00fcr den Aufbau der Wehrmacht}}){{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=7}} and the reintroduction of conscription.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=408}} While the size of the standing army was to remain at about the 100,000-man mark decreed by the treaty, a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year. The conscription law introduced the name \"''Wehrmacht''\"; the ''Reichswehr'' was officially renamed the Wehrmacht on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Stone|2006|p=316}} Hitler's proclamation of the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s existence included a total of no less than 36 divisions in its original projection, contravening the Treaty of Versailles in grandiose fashion. In December 1935, General [[Ludwig Beck]] added 48 tank battalions to the planned rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=208}} Hitler originally set a time frame of 10 years for remilitarization, but soon shortened it to four years.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=12-13}} With the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the German Reich's territory increased significantly, providing a larger population pool for conscription.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=13}}\n\n== Personnel and recruitment ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43590, Potsdam, Musterung f\u00fcr die Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|Inspection of German conscripts|alt=Men standing in line waiting for a medical check|211x211px]]\nRecruitment for the ''Wehrmacht'' was accomplished through voluntary enlistment and conscription, with 1.3&nbsp;million being drafted and 2.4&nbsp;million volunteering in the period 1935\u20131939.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|pp=I-57|p=}}{{Sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=12}} The total number of soldiers who served in the ''Wehrmacht'' during its existence from 1935 to 1945 is believed to have approached 18.2&nbsp;million.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} The German military leadership originally aimed at a homogeneous military, possessing traditional [[Prussian militarism|Prussian military]] values. However, with Hitler's constant wishes to increase the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s size, the Army was forced to accept citizens of lower class and education, decreasing internal cohesion and appointing officers who lacked real-war experience from previous conflicts, especially [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe effectiveness of officer training and recruitment by the Wehrmacht has been identified as a major factor in its early victories as well as its ability to keep the war going as long as it did even as the war turned against Germany.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=292\u2013293}}{{sfn|Kjoerstad|2010|p=6}}\n[[File:Nazi World War II poster Danzig is German.jpg|alt=|thumb|316x316px|Common themes in [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] revolved around national humiliation after the [[Treaty of Versailles]], seen as a ''diktat'' (dictation) by Germans. This poster expresses that the corridor of \"[[Danzig]] is German\"; ceded to [[Poland]] as [[Port|maritime access]], it simultaneously divided [[East Prussia]] from the rest of Germany.]]\n\nAs the Second World War intensified, ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' personnel were increasingly transferred to the army, and \"voluntary\" enlistments in the ''SS'' were stepped up as well. Following the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, fitness and physical health standards for ''Wehrmacht'' recruits were drastically lowered, with the regime going so far as to create \"special diet\" battalions for men with severe stomach ailments. Rear-echelon personnel were more often sent to front-line duty wherever possible, especially during the final two years of the war where, inspired by constant propaganda, the oldest and [[Hitler Youth|youngest]] were being recruited and driven by instilled fear and fanaticism to serve on the fronts and, often, to fight to the death, whether judged to be cannon fodder or elite troops.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|p=I-3}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1465-16, Griechenland, Soldaten der \"Legion Freies Arabien\".jpg|thumb|An African soldier of the [[Free Arabian Legion]]|alt=An African in German uniform sitting on a chair, next to two other soldiers having a cigarette]]\nPrior to World War II, the ''Wehrmacht'' strove to remain a purely ethnic German force; as such, minorities within and outside of Germany, such as the Czechs in annexed [[Czechoslovakia]], were exempted from military service after Hitler's takeover in 1938. Foreign volunteers were generally not accepted in the German armed forces prior to 1941.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|p=I-3}} With the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, the government's positions changed.

It consisted of the ''[[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Heer]]'' (army), the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (navy) and the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force). The designation \"''Wehrmacht''\" replaced the previously used term ''[[Reichswehr]]'', and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to [[German re-armament|rearm Germany]] to a greater extent than the [[Treaty of Versailles]] permitted.{{sfn|Taylor|1995|pp=90\u2013119}}\n\nAfter the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Nazi rise to power]] in 1933, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s most overt and audacious moves was to establish the ''Wehrmacht'', a modern offensively-capable armed force, fulfilling the Nazi regime's long-term goals of regaining lost territory as well as gaining new territory and dominating its neighbours. This required the reinstatement of conscription, and massive investment and [[defense spending]] on the [[arms industry]].{{sfn|Kitchen|1994|pp=39\u201365}}\n\nThe ''Wehrmacht'' formed the heart of Germany's politico-military power. In the early part of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the ''Wehrmacht'' employed combined arms tactics (close cover air-support, tanks, and infantry) to devastating effect in what became known as ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' (lightning war). Its campaigns in [[Battle of France|France (1940)]], the [[Operation Barbarossa|Soviet Union (1941)]], and [[North African Campaign|North Africa (1941/42)]] are regarded as acts of boldness.{{sfn|Van Creveld|1982|p=3}} At the same time, the far-flung advances strained the ''Wehrmacht's'' capacity to the breaking point, culminating in the first major defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] (1941); by late 1942, Germany was losing the initiative in all theatres. The operational art was no match to the war-making abilities of the Allied coalition, making the ''Wehrmacht's'' weaknesses in strategy, doctrine, and logistics readily apparent.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=58\u201359}}\n\nClosely cooperating with the [[Schutzstaffel|''SS'']] and the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the German armed forces committed numerous [[Wehrmacht war crimes|war crimes]], despite later denials and promotion of the [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht|myth of the clean ''Wehrmacht'']].{{sfn|Hartmann|2013|pp=85\u2013108}} The majority of the war crimes were committed in the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy, as part of the [[war of annihilation]] against the Soviet Union, [[the Holocaust]] and [[Nazi security warfare]].\n\nDuring the war about 18 million men served in the ''Wehrmacht''.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} By the time the war ended in Europe in May 1945, German forces (consisting of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|''Heer'']], the [[Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']], the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', the ''[[Volkssturm]]'', and [[Wehrmacht foreign volunteers and conscripts|foreign collaborateur units]]) had lost approximately 11,300,000 men,{{sfn|Fritz|2011| p=470}} about half of whom were missing or killed during the war. Only a few of the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s upper leadership were tried for war crimes, despite evidence suggesting that more were involved in illegal actions.{{sfn|Wette|2006|pp=195\u2013250}}{{sfn|USHMM|n.d.}} The majority of the three million ''Wehrmacht'' soldiers who invaded the [[Operation Barbarossa|USSR]] participated in committing war crimes.{{Sfn|Kershaw|1997|p=150}}\n\n== Origin ==\n===Etymology===\nThe German term ''\"Wehrmacht''\" stems from the compound word of {{lang-de|wehren}}, \"to defend\" and {{lang|de|Macht}}, \"power, force\".{{efn|See [[wikt:Wehrmacht#German|the Wiktionary article]] for more information.}} It has been used to describe any nation's armed forces; for example, ''Britische Wehrmacht'' meaning \"British Armed Forces\". The [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849 designated all German military forces as the \"German ''Wehrmacht''\", consisting of the ''Seemacht'' (sea force) and the ''Landmacht'' (land force).{{sfn|Huber|2000}} In 1919, the term ''Wehrmacht'' also appears in Article 47 of the [[Weimar Constitution]], establishing that: \"The Reich's President holds supreme command of all armed forces [i.e. the ''Wehrmacht''] of the Reich\". From 1919, Germany's national defense force was known as the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', a name that was dropped in favor of ''Wehrmacht'' on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Strohn|2010|p=10}}\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-16108,_Vereidigung_von_Reichswehr-Soldaten_auf_Hitler.jpg|alt=|thumb|253x253px|''Reichswehr'' soldiers swearing the [[Hitler oath]] in August 1934]]\nIn January 1919, after [[World War I]] ended with the signing of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice of 11 November 1918]], the armed forces were dubbed ''Friedensheer'' (peace army).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=60}} In March 1919, the national assembly passed a law founding a 420,000-strong preliminary army, the ''Vorl\u00e4ufige Reichswehr''. The terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] were announced in May, and in June, Germany signed the treaty that, among other terms, imposed severe constraints on the size of Germany's armed forces. The army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy. The fleet was to consist of at most six [[battleship]]s, six [[cruiser]]s, and twelve [[destroyer]]s. [[Submarine]]s, [[tank]]s and heavy [[artillery]] were forbidden and the air-force was dissolved. A new post-war military, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'', was established on 23 March 1921. [[Conscription|General conscription]] was abolished under another mandate of the Versailles treaty.{{sfn|Craig|1980|pp=424\u2013432}}\n\nThe ''Reichswehr'' was limited to 115,000 men, and thus the armed forces, under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]], retained only the most capable officers. The American historians Alan Millet and [[Williamson Murray]] wrote \"In reducing the officers corps, Seeckt chose the new leadership from the best men of the general staff with ruthless disregard for other constituencies, such as war heroes and the nobility\".{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Seeckt's determination that the ''Reichswehr'' be an elite cadre force that would serve as the nucleus of an expanded military when the chance for restoring conscription came essentially led to the creation of a new army, based upon, but very different from, the army that existed in World War I.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} In the 1920s, Seeckt and his officers developed new doctrines that emphasized speed, aggression, combined arms and initiative on the part of lower officers to take advantage of momentary opportunities.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=22}} Though Seeckt retired in 1926, the army that went to war in 1939 was largely his creation.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=22}}\n\nGermany was forbidden to have an air force by the Versailles treaty; nonetheless, Seeckt created a clandestine cadre of air force officers in the early 1920s. These officers saw the role of an air force as winning air superiority, tactical and strategic bombing and providing ground support. That the ''Luftwaffe'' did not develop a strategic bombing force in the 1930s was not due to a lack of interest, but because of economic limitations.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=33}} The leadership of the Navy led by Grand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], a close prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], was dedicated to the idea of reviving Tirpitz's High Seas Fleet. Officers who believed in submarine warfare led by Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] were in a minority before 1939.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=37}}\n\nBy 1922, Germany had begun covertly circumventing the conditions of the Versailles treaty. A secret collaboration with the [[Soviet Union]] began after the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1922)|Treaty of Rapallo]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=131}} Major-General {{ill|Otto Hasse (General)|de|Otto Hasse (General)|lt=Otto Hasse}} traveled to Moscow in 1923 to further negotiate the terms. Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialization and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany. German tank and air-force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects.{{sfn|Zeidler|2006|pp=106\u2013111}} In 1924 a [[Lipetsk fighter-pilot school|fighter-pilot school]] was established at [[Lipetsk]], where several hundred German air force personnel received instruction in operational maintenance, navigation, and aerial combat training over the next decade until the Germans finally left in September 1933.{{sfn|Cooper|1981|pp=382\u2013383}} However, the arms buildup was done in secrecy, until Hitler came to power and it received broad political support.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=10}}\n\n== Nazi rise to power ==\n{{further|Nazism and the Wehrmacht|German re-armament}}\nAfter the death of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on 2 August 1934, [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed the office of [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President of Germany]], and thus became commander in chief. In February 1934, the Defence Minister [[Werner von Blomberg]], acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the armed forces adopt [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] into their uniforms in May 1934.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} In August of the same year, on Blomberg's initiative and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took the [[Hitler oath]], an oath of personal loyalty to Hitler. Hitler was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false.{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} The oath read: \"I swear by God this sacred oath that to the Leader of the German empire and people, Adolf Hitler, supreme commander of the armed forces, I shall render unconditional obedience and that as a brave soldier I shall at all times be prepared to give my life for this oath\".{{sfn|Broszat|Buchheim|Jacobsen|Krausnick|1999|p=18}}\n\nBy 1935, Germany was openly flouting the military restrictions set forth in the Versailles Treaty: [[German re-armament]] was announced on 16 March with the \"Edict for the Buildup of the ''Wehrmacht''\" ({{lang-de|Gesetz f\u00fcr den Aufbau der Wehrmacht}}){{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=7}} and the reintroduction of conscription.{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=408}} While the size of the standing army was to remain at about the 100,000-man mark decreed by the treaty, a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year. The conscription law introduced the name \"''Wehrmacht''\"; the ''Reichswehr'' was officially renamed the Wehrmacht on 21 May 1935.{{sfn|Stone|2006|p=316}} Hitler's proclamation of the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s existence included a total of no less than 36 divisions in its original projection, contravening the Treaty of Versailles in grandiose fashion. In December 1935, General [[Ludwig Beck]] added 48 tank battalions to the planned rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=208}} Hitler originally set a time frame of 10 years for remilitarization, but soon shortened it to four years.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=12-13}} With the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the German Reich's territory increased significantly, providing a larger population pool for conscription.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=13}}\n\n== Personnel and recruitment ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R43590, Potsdam, Musterung f\u00fcr die Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|Inspection of German conscripts|alt=Men standing in line waiting for a medical check|211x211px]]\nRecruitment for the ''Wehrmacht'' was accomplished through voluntary enlistment and conscription, with 1.3&nbsp;million being drafted and 2.4&nbsp;million volunteering in the period 1935\u20131939.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|pp=I-57|p=}}{{Sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|p=12}} The total number of soldiers who served in the ''Wehrmacht'' during its existence from 1935 to 1945 is believed to have approached 18.2&nbsp;million.{{Sfnm|1a1=Overmans|1y=2004|1p=215|2a1=M\u00fcller|2y=2016|2p=16|3a1=Wette|3y=2006|3p=77}} The German military leadership originally aimed at a homogeneous military, possessing traditional [[Prussian militarism|Prussian military]] values. However, with Hitler's constant wishes to increase the ''Wehrmacht''<nowiki/>'s size, the Army was forced to accept citizens of lower class and education, decreasing internal cohesion and appointing officers who lacked real-war experience from previous conflicts, especially [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|M\u00fcller|2016|pp=13-14}}\n\nThe effectiveness of officer training and recruitment by the Wehrmacht has been identified as a major factor in its early victories as well as its ability to keep the war going as long as it did even as the war turned against Germany.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=292\u2013293}}{{sfn|Kjoerstad|2010|p=6}}\n[[File:Nazi World War II poster Danzig is German.jpg|alt=|thumb|316x316px|Common themes in [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]] revolved around national humiliation after the [[Treaty of Versailles]], seen as a ''diktat'' (dictation) by Germans.

Following the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, fitness and physical health standards for ''Wehrmacht'' recruits were drastically lowered, with the regime going so far as to create \"special diet\" battalions for men with severe stomach ailments. Rear-echelon personnel were more often sent to front-line duty wherever possible, especially during the final two years of the war where, inspired by constant propaganda, the oldest and [[Hitler Youth|youngest]] were being recruited and driven by instilled fear and fanaticism to serve on the fronts and, often, to fight to the death, whether judged to be cannon fodder or elite troops.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|p=I-3}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-177-1465-16, Griechenland, Soldaten der \"Legion Freies Arabien\".jpg|thumb|An African soldier of the [[Free Arabian Legion]]|alt=An African in German uniform sitting on a chair, next to two other soldiers having a cigarette]]\nPrior to World War II, the ''Wehrmacht'' strove to remain a purely ethnic German force; as such, minorities within and outside of Germany, such as the Czechs in annexed [[Czechoslovakia]], were exempted from military service after Hitler's takeover in 1938. Foreign volunteers were generally not accepted in the German armed forces prior to 1941.{{sfn|U.S. War Department|1945|p=I-3}} With the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941, the government's positions changed.
