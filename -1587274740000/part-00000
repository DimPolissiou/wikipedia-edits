In the process, Hope runs into her old friend Landon, who is also Rafael's foster brother, but since the school for the supernatural is deemed to be too dangerous for humans, Landon is turned away. When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

When student vampire MG fails to compel Landon to forget his knowledge of the supernatural, it is assumed that Landon has ingested vervain and he is locked up until it can clear his system. Hope visits Landon in his cell while Alaric's daughters Josie and Lizzie give Rafael a tour of the school. Hope tells Landon the truth about her supernatural origins and, knowing that his mind will be erased, he kisses her. Once Landon leaves, it is revealed that the compulsion has still not worked and that Landon stole a knife from the school. Hope enlists Josie to help her locate the knife and Landon.

According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=51}} Param\u0101rtha states that the [[Kukku\u1e6dika]] sect did not accept the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras as ''[[buddhavacana]]'' (\"words of the Buddha\"), while the [[Lokottarav\u0101da]] sect and the [[Ekavy\u0101vah\u0101rika]] sect did accept the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras as ''buddhavacana''.<ref>Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. p. 68.</ref> Also in the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes of the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas using a \"Great \u0100gama Pi\u1e6daka,\" which is then associated with Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras such as the ''[[Prajnaparamita|Praj\u00f1\u0101paramit\u0101]]'' and the ''[[Dasabhumika Sutra|Da\u015babh\u016bmika S\u016btra]]''.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=53}}\n\nAccording to some sources, abhidharma was not accepted as canonical by the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika school.<ref>\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.  Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2008.</ref> The Therav\u0101din ''[[Dipavamsa|D\u012bpava\u1e43sa]]'', for example, records that the Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghikas had no abhidharma.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=213}} However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma, and the Chinese pilgrims [[Faxian]] and [[Xuanzang]] both mention Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika abhidharma. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at [[Nagarjunakonda|N\u0101g\u0101rjunako\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101]], Joseph Walser concludes that at least some Mah\u0101s\u0101\u1e43ghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=212-213}}\n\n===Caitika===\nThe [[Caitika]]s included a number of sub-sects including the P\u016brva\u015bailas, Apara\u015bailas, Siddh\u0101rthikas, and R\u0101jagirikas. In the 6th century CE, Avalokitavrata writes that Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras such as the ''Praj\u00f1\u0101paramit\u0101'' and others are chanted by the Apara\u015bailas and the P\u016brva\u015bailas.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=53}} Also in the 6th century CE, [[Bhavaviveka|Bh\u0101vaviveka]] speaks of the Siddh\u0101rthikas using a Vidy\u0101dh\u0101ra Pi\u1e6daka, and the P\u016brva\u015bailas and Apara\u015bailas both using a [[Bodhisattva]] Pi\u1e6daka, implying collections of [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] texts within these Caitika schools.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=53}}\n\n===Bahu\u015brut\u012bya===\nThe [[Bahusrutiya|Bahu\u015brut\u012bya]] school is said to have included a Bodhisattva Pi\u1e6daka in their canon. The ''{{IAST|Satyasiddhi \u015a\u0101stra}}'', also called the ''{{IAST|Tattvasiddhi \u015a\u0101stra}}'', is an extant abhidharma from the Bahu\u015brut\u012bya school. This abhidharma was translated into Chinese in sixteen fascicles (Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka 1646).<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0966.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (K 966)}}</ref> Its authorship is attributed to Harivarman, a third-century monk from central India. Param\u0101rtha cites this Bahu\u015brut\u012bya abhidharma as containing a combination of [[Hinayana|H\u012bnay\u0101na]] and Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctrines, and Joseph Walser agrees that this assessment is correct.{{sfn|Walser|2005|p=52}}\n\n===Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da===\nThe [[Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101da|Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101dins]] held that the Buddha's teachings in the various pi\u1e6dakas were nominal (Skt. ''praj\u00f1apti''), conventional (Skt. ''{{IAST|sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti}}''), and causal (Skt. ''hetuphala'').{{sfn|Dutt|1998|p=118}} Therefore, all teachings were viewed by the Praj\u00f1aptiv\u0101dins as being of provisional importance, since they cannot contain the ultimate truth.{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=98}} It has been observed that this view of the Buddha's teachings is very close to the fully developed position of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras.{{sfn|Dutt|1998|p=118}} {{sfn|Harris|1991|p=98}}\n\n===S\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da===\nScholars at present have \"a nearly complete collection of s\u016btras from the [[Sarvastivada|Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] school\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sujato|first=Bhikkhu|authorlink=Bhante Sujato|url=http://santipada.googlepages.com/whatthebuddhareallytaught|title=The Pali Nik\u0101yas and Chinese \u0100gamas|website=What the Buddha Really Taught|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref> thanks to a recent discovery in Afghanistan of roughly two-thirds of D\u012brgha \u0100gama in Sanskrit.

The Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama (Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka 99) was translated by [[Gu\u1e47abhadra]], also available in Chinese translation. The Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da is therefore the only early school besides the Theravada for which we have a roughly complete S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka. The S\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka is also extant in Chinese translation, as are the seven books of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Abhidharma Pi\u1e6daka. There is also the encyclopedic ''[[Mahavibhasa|Abhidharma Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63a \u015a\u0101stra]]'' (Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka 1545), which was held as canonical by the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101dins of northwest India.\n\n===M\u016blas\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da===\nPortions of the [[Mulasarvastivada|M\u016blas\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] Tripi\u1e6daka survive in Tibetan translation and Nepalese manuscripts.<ref>[http://pnclink.org/annual/annual2000/2000pdf/6-4-2.pdf Preservation of Sanskrit Buddhist Manuscripts In the Kathmandu]</ref> The relationship of the M\u016blas\u0101rv\u0101stiv\u0101da school to Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school is indeterminate; their vinayas certainly differed but it is not clear that their S\u016btra Pi\u1e6daka did.

It contains 30 s\u016btras in contrast to the 34 suttas of the Theravadin D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya. [[A. K. Warder]] also associates the extant ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' (''Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka'' 125) with the Dharmaguptaka school, due to the number of rules for monastics, which corresponds to the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya.<ref>Warder, A.K.

However, it was the 'Kaiyuan Era Catalogue' by [[Zhisheng]] in 730 that provided the lasting structure.

In Chinese culture, this is notable in the case of the Tang Dynasty monk [[Xuanzang]], whose pilgrimage to India to study and bring Buddhist texts back to China was portrayed in the novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'' as \"Tang Sanzang\" (Tang Dynasty Tripi\u1e6daka Master). Due to the popularity of the novel, the term \"s\u0101nz\u00e0ng\" is often erroneously understood as a name of the monk [[Xuanzang]].

In Chinese culture, this is notable in the case of the Tang Dynasty monk [[Xuanzang]], whose pilgrimage to India to study and bring Buddhist texts back to China was portrayed in the novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'' as \"Tang Sanzang\" (Tang Dynasty Tripi\u1e6daka Master). Due to the popularity of the novel, the term \"s\u0101nz\u00e0ng\" is often erroneously understood as a name of the monk [[Xuanzang]].

His acting career launched when he worked as a mid-day [[disc jockey]] on WFAA in Dallas. He also occasionally appeared on [[WFAA-TV]] Channel 8, playing Creech, an outer space creature on the \"[[Dialing for Dollars]]\" segments on Ed Hogan's afternoon movies.

This is shown in the Snap Snap special feature.</ref> He also played the character named [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]], while associate producer Jack Voglin would take over the role in scenes with both characters. Though the character of Lurch was originally intended to be mute, when Cassidy ad-libbed \"You rang?\" in response to the butler call, the subtle humor and the deepness of his voice was immediately a hit. \"You rang\" became his signature line, and more speaking parts were written for him. Several episodes were written to feature Lurch.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/ted-cassidy-you-rang/1886/|title=Ted Cassidy, You Rang?|work=Legacy.com}}</ref>\n\nCassidy would reprise the role of Lurch in later appearances. In the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episode \"The Penguin's Nest\" (1966), he appears during the heroes' familiar climb scene up the side of a building, as a tenant who is playing the ''Addam's Family'' theme on harpsichord prior to sticking his head out of the window and speaking to Batman and Robin. He voiced Lurch in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (1972), and in the 1973 animated series adaptation of ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]''.\n\nIn addition to ''The Addams Family'', Cassidy found steady work in a variety of other television shows.<ref name=btkfsmh /> He had a prominent role on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' as Injun Joe, the blood-foe of Tom Sawyer and Huck. In the 1967 ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' episode \"The Napoleon's Tomb Affair\", Cassidy played a henchman, Edgar, who kidnaps, tortures, and repeatedly tries to kill Napoleon and Illya. \n\nCassidy also provided the voices of the more aggressive version of Balok in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Corbomite Maneuver]]\" and the [[Gorn]] in the episode \"[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]\",  and played the part of the android Ruk in the episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\". Cassidy did more work with ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in the early 1970s, playing Isaiah in the [[post-apocalyptic]] drama pilots ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (TV pilot)|Planet Earth]]''. In the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode, \"The Thief from Outer Space\", he played the Slave to the alien Thief ([[Malachi Throne]]) who threatens the Robinsons.\n\nIn ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' episode \"The Dahlia Feud\" from 1967, he played Mr. Ted, a large, muscular gardener who was planting [[dahlia]]s for Mrs. Drysdale. In 1968, Cassidy appeared on ''[[Mannix]]'' in the episode [[Mannix (season 1)|\"To Kill a Writer\"]] as Felipe Montoya, on ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' in \"The Scrimshaw Ivory Chart\" as a pirate named Gentle Sam, and in two episodes of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' as the master of Jeannie's devious sister in the episode \"Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?\", and Jeannie's cousin in the episode \"Please Don't Feed the Astronauts\".\n\nIn the two-part ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' episode \"The Return of Bigfoot\" (1976), Cassidy performed as the body and vocal effects of [[Bigfoot]] (the role was originally played by professional wrestler [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] in a previous two-parter). Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode \"Bigfoot V\".\n\n===Film work===\nConcurrent with his appearances on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] Studios, culminating in the role of Frankenstein, Jr. in ''[[Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles]]'' series. He was the voice of ''Meteor Man'' in ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', as well as the hero in the [[Chuck Menville]] pixillated short film ''[[Blaze Glory]]'', in which his already-deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound. Cassidy also voiced Ben Grimm (\"The Thing\") in ''[[The New Fantastic Four]]''. Cassidy went on to perform the roars and growls for [[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]] in the 1979 cartoon series that Hanna Barbera co-produced with [[Toho]]; and was also the voice of Montaro in the ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]'' segments that accompanied [[Godzilla]] during its first network run.  His was the basis for the sinister voice of [[Black Manta]], as well as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and several others on ''[[Super Friends]]''. Cassidy was the original voice of [[Moltar]] and [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast characters|Metallus]] on ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' from 1966 to 1968. Cassidy's final role was as King Thun of the Lion Men in the [[Filmation]] television animated feature film, ''[[Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All]]''. That particular role was originally recorded shortly before Cassidy's death in 1979 until the decision was made to use the footage for a television series, ''[[The New Adventures of Flash Gordon]]''. As such, Cassidy's death necessitated his role being recast for the series with [[Allan Melvin]]. After the series' conclusion, the original feature film and soundtrack were reassembled and broadcast in prime time in 1982 with Cassidy's performance used. After ''The Addams Family'', on the TV series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', he provided narration of the title sequence, and the Hulk's growls and roars. In deleted scenes from the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV pilot movie, \"[[Saga of a Star World]]\", Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] [[Imperious Leader]], before actor [[Patrick Macnee]] was contracted to voice the character.<ref>{{cite video | type=DVD | title=Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Epic Series | origyear=1978}}</ref>\n\nOther film work includes ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Mackenna's Gold]]'' (1969), ''The Limit'' (1972), ''[[Black Rage (film)|Charcoal Black]]'' (1972), ''[[The Slams]]'' (1973), ''Thunder County'' (1974), ''[[Poor Pretty Eddie]]'' (1975), ''[[Harry and Walter Go to New York]]'' (1976), ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]'' (1977) and ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' (1978). Alongside Michael Werner, he co-wrote the screenplay of 1973's ''[[The Harrad Experiment]]'', in which he made a brief appearance. During that time he also worked with [[Noel Marshall]], the executive producer of ''Harrad Experiment'', on the adventure-comedy film ''[[Roar (film)|Roar]]'' (released two years after his death).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kqek.com/mobile/?p=11643|title=Film: Roar (1981)|last=Hasan|first=Mark R.|work=KQEK.com|date=June 18, 2015|access-date=January 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128030645/http://kqek.com/mobile/?p=11643|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he released a seven-inch vinyl record on Capitol Records with two songs on it: \"The Lurch\", written by [[Gary S.

His acting career launched when he worked as a mid-day [[disc jockey]] on WFAA in Dallas. He also occasionally appeared on [[WFAA-TV]] Channel 8, playing Creech, an outer space creature on the \"[[Dialing for Dollars]]\" segments on Ed Hogan's afternoon movies.  He gave an in-studio report from WFAA radio station on the day [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F.

This is shown in the Snap Snap special feature.</ref> He also played the character named [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]], while associate producer Jack Voglin would take over the role in scenes with both characters. Though the character of Lurch was originally intended to be mute, when Cassidy ad-libbed \"You rang?\" in response to the butler call, the subtle humor and the deepness of his voice was immediately a hit. \"You rang\" became his signature line, and more speaking parts were written for him. Several episodes were written to feature Lurch.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.legacy.com/news/legends-and-legacies/ted-cassidy-you-rang/1886/|title=Ted Cassidy, You Rang?|work=Legacy.com}}</ref>\n\nCassidy would reprise the role of Lurch in later appearances. In the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episode \"The Penguin's Nest\" (1966), he appears during the heroes' familiar climb scene up the side of a building, as a tenant who is playing the ''Addam's Family'' theme on harpsichord prior to sticking his head out of the window and speaking to Batman and Robin. He voiced Lurch in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' (1972), and in the 1973 animated series adaptation of ''[[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|The Addams Family]]''.\n\nIn addition to ''The Addams Family'', Cassidy found steady work in a variety of other television shows.<ref name=btkfsmh /> He had a prominent role on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' as Injun Joe, the blood-foe of Tom Sawyer and Huck. In the 1967 ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'' episode \"The Napoleon's Tomb Affair\", Cassidy played a henchman, Edgar, who kidnaps, tortures, and repeatedly tries to kill Napoleon and Illya. \n\nCassidy also provided the voices of the more aggressive version of Balok in the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode \"[[The Corbomite Maneuver]]\" and the [[Gorn]] in the episode \"[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]\",  and played the part of the android Ruk in the episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\". Cassidy did more work with ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] in the early 1970s, playing Isaiah in the [[post-apocalyptic]] drama pilots ''[[Genesis II (film)|Genesis II]]'' and ''[[Planet Earth (TV pilot)|Planet Earth]]''. In the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode, \"The Thief from Outer Space\", he played the Slave to the alien Thief ([[Malachi Throne]]) who threatens the Robinsons.\n\nIn ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' episode \"The Dahlia Feud\" from 1967, he played Mr. Ted, a large, muscular gardener who was planting [[dahlia]]s for Mrs. Drysdale. In 1968, Cassidy appeared on ''[[Mannix]]'' in the episode [[Mannix (season 1)|\"To Kill a Writer\"]] as Felipe Montoya, on ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' in \"The Scrimshaw Ivory Chart\" as a pirate named Gentle Sam, and in two episodes of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' as the master of Jeannie's devious sister in the episode \"Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie?\", and Jeannie's cousin in the episode \"Please Don't Feed the Astronauts\".\n\nIn the two-part ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' episode \"The Return of Bigfoot\" (1976), Cassidy performed as the body and vocal effects of [[Bigfoot]] (the role was originally played by professional wrestler [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] in a previous two-parter). Cassidy reprised the role in the 1977 episode \"Bigfoot V\".\n\n===Film work===\nConcurrent with his appearances on ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', Cassidy began doing character voices on a recurring basis for the [[Hanna-Barbera]] Studios, culminating in the role of Frankenstein, Jr. in ''[[Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles]]'' series. He was the voice of ''Meteor Man'' in ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', as well as the hero in the [[Chuck Menville]] pixillated short film ''[[Blaze Glory]]'', in which his already-deep voice was enhanced with reverb echo to give the character an exaggerated super-hero sound. Cassidy also voiced Ben Grimm (\"The Thing\") in ''[[The New Fantastic Four]]''. Cassidy went on to perform the roars and growls for [[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]] in the 1979 cartoon series that Hanna Barbera co-produced with [[Toho]]; and was also the voice of Montaro in the ''[[Jana of the Jungle]]'' segments that accompanied [[Godzilla]] during its first network run.  His was the basis for the sinister voice of [[Black Manta]], as well as [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] and several others on ''[[Super Friends]]''. Cassidy was the original voice of [[Moltar]] and [[List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast characters|Metallus]] on ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'' from 1966 to 1968. Cassidy's final role was as King Thun of the Lion Men in the [[Filmation]] television animated feature film, ''[[Flash Gordon: The Greatest Adventure of All]]''. That particular role was originally recorded shortly before Cassidy's death in 1979 until the decision was made to use the footage for a television series, ''[[The New Adventures of Flash Gordon]]''. As such, Cassidy's death necessitated his role being recast for the series with [[Allan Melvin]]. After the series' conclusion, the original feature film and soundtrack were reassembled and broadcast in prime time in 1982 with Cassidy's performance used. After ''The Addams Family'', on the TV series ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', he provided narration of the title sequence, and the Hulk's growls and roars. In deleted scenes from the original ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV pilot movie, \"[[Saga of a Star World]]\", Cassidy can be heard providing temporary voice tracks of the [[Cylon (1978)|Cylon]] [[Imperious Leader]], before actor [[Patrick Macnee]] was contracted to voice the character.<ref>{{cite video | type=DVD | title=Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Epic Series | origyear=1978}}</ref>\n\nOther film work includes ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969), ''[[Mackenna's Gold]]'' (1969), ''The Limit'' (1972), ''[[Black Rage (film)|Charcoal Black]]'' (1972), ''[[The Slams]]'' (1973), ''Thunder County'' (1974), ''[[Poor Pretty Eddie]]'' (1975), ''[[Harry and Walter Go to New York]]'' (1976), ''[[The Last Remake of Beau Geste]]'' (1977) and ''[[Goin' Coconuts]]'' (1978). Alongside Michael Werner, he co-wrote the screenplay of 1973's ''[[The Harrad Experiment]]'', in which he made a brief appearance. During that time he also worked with [[Noel Marshall]], the executive producer of ''Harrad Experiment'', on the adventure-comedy film ''[[Roar (film)|Roar]]'' (released two years after his death).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kqek.com/mobile/?p=11643|title=Film: Roar (1981)|last=Hasan|first=Mark R.|work=KQEK.com|date=June 18, 2015|access-date=January 27, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128030645/http://kqek.com/mobile/?p=11643|archive-date=January 28, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, he released a seven-inch vinyl record on Capitol Records with two songs on it: \"The Lurch\", written by [[Gary S.

It is on the borders the counties [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Kerry|Kerry]] and [[County Limerick|Limerick]], and bounded to the south by the [[Munster Blackwater|River Blackwater]]. It includes the [[Mullaghareirk Mountains]].\n\n==Music and literature==\nSliabh Luachra has produced several Irish poets: Geoffrey Fionn D\u00e1laigh, [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]], and the charismatic Gaelic poet [[Eoghan Rua \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]] (1748\u20131784). This latter poet's many exploits live on in local folklore, as do his poetry and aislings (dramatic descriptions). His solo set dance, \"Rodney's Glory,\" was composed in 1783 and follows his adventures after being forced to join the British Navy. Sliabh Luachra was also the birthplace of the folklorist, poet, and translator Edward Walsh (1805\u20131850), [[Patrick S. Dinneen]], who compiled Dineen's Dictionary, viewed as the \"bible\" of Irish language, and Tom\u00e1s Rathaille, Superior General of the Presentation Brothers 1905\u20131925 who wrote two books of Irish poetry:  ''An Spideog'' and ''An Cuaic\u00edn Draoidheachta''. This tradition of poetry continues to present day with Bernard O'Donoghue (now a lecturer in Oxford University) who won the prestigious Whitbread prize for a collection of poems in 1993/94. Professor Daniel Corkery, author of ''The Hidden Ireland'' wrote that Sliabh Luachra was the literary capital of Ireland.<ref>http://www.sliabhluachra.com/history?page=2</ref>\n\nThis region has a unique musical style which makes heavy use of the [[polka]] and the [[Slide (tune type)|slide]]. Musicians from the area include [[Denis Murphy (Irish musician)|Denis Murphy]], [[Julia Clifford]], [[Paddy Cronin]], [[Padraig O'Keeffe]], [[Johnny O'Leary]], Maurice O' Keeffe, [[Jackie Daly]], Con Curtin and [[Donal Murphy]].\n\n==Religion==\n\n[[Mo Ling|St Moling]] was born in Sliabh Luachra in 614 AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicireland.net/books/197-saints-a-great-people/1384-saint-moling-luachra-a-pilgrimage-from-sliabh-luachra-to-rinn-ros-broic-above-the-stream-pools-of-the-barrow|title=Saint Moling Luachra: A pilgrimage from Sliabh Luachra to Rinn Ros Broic above the stream-pools of the Barrow |year=2011|publisher=CatholicIreland.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe mountainous area along the Cork/Kerry border is known as Sliabh Luachra. This uninhabited wet, marshy, rushy, mountain area of the old [[Ciarraige Luachra |Kingdom of Luachra]] was first noted in the Annals of Inisfallen in 534 when the King of Luacar won a battle against Tuathal Moel nGarb. It came to light again in 741 AD with the death of Cuaine, Abbot of Ferna and Flan Ferna, son of Cormac King of Luachra.\n\nHundreds of years ago, the area was sparsely populated. It was an area of bogs, rushes, marshes, and woodlands, an area only suitable for refugees trying to avoid the imperial authorities. Its remoteness and the barren soil proved attractive to those people as the authorities were less likely to bother them in their inhospitable environment.\n\nSettlement did not come to the remaining thousand square miles of Sliabh Luachra until the [[Desmond Rebellions|Desmond rebellion]]. This rebellion ended with the death of [[Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond|Gerald Fitzgerald]], the 15th Earl of Desmond in 1583. His last hiding place, Teach an Iarla, can still be seen cut into a glen in the heart of the Sliabh Luachra mountains near the source of the [[Blackwater River (Kerry)|river Blackwater]]. The rebellion resulted in the scorched earth policy of Queen Elizabeth's army, which devastated much of [[Munster]]. Men, women and children were put to the sword and land and crops were burned, resulting in a great famine, impacting the area from Ventry to Cashel.\n\nFollowing this devastation, [[Munster]] began restoration with a half a million acres being declared Crown property and being distributed to English landlords. Former inhabitants were ordered to relocate to Connacht. Some of the dispossessed and poverty stricken people of Munster took refuge in Sliabh Luachra, which was also Crown property. Much of this land was recorded as mountain pastures; however, the authorities were unsuccessful at its distribution to landlords.\n\nThis area remained undisturbed and largely unaccounted for until the agrarian disturbances of the [[Rockite movement]] in the 1820s.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/30006930]</ref> The Rockite movement began in West Limerick in the summer of 1821. The first leader of the Rockite movement, known as Captain Rock, was a Patrick Dillane who may have come from the Sliabh Luachra area. Many of the leaders of the movement hid in Sliabh Luachra, thereby creating British Government concern over the area's preponderance of outlaws and rebels. Further, the Government was not receiving any revenues from the area and was unable to control the 960 square miles due to lack of roads and communication.\n\nA report by James Weale on the Crown Lands of [[County Cork]] addressed the Government's apprehensions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. It also pointed out that, in the summer, farmers from North Kerry and parts of West [[Limerick]] would transport butter on horseback via a [[mountain path]] through the [[Rockchapel]] to Newmarket, two firkins per horse. There, it was transferred to horse carts carrying 24 firkins and sent on to the largest butter market in the world in Cork City. In 1830, these farmers sent 30,000 firkins valued at 52,000, with much of it passing through the [[Rockchapel]] mountain path.\n\nThis report then initiated a program of road building, including the road from Castle Island to Clonbanin, from Ballydesmond to Newmarket, and the new line road, along the Feale Valley from Feales Bridge through Rockchapel to Newmarket, The engineering work on these roads and bridges was completed by Richard Griffith, who later became well known in Ireland through his Griffith valuations of 1852. The report also created the village of [[Ballydesmond|Kingwilliamstown]] (Ballydesmond), as was a model farm at Glencollins near [[Ballydesmond]]. Here, it was demonstrated that good grass could be grown on peaty soil by the use of burnt lime, resulting in the building of lime kilns in and around the Sliabh Luachra area.\n\nIn 1896, [[Gneeveguilla|Gneeveeguilla]] was the scene of the devastating moving bog, a landslide which wiped out an entire family as they slept.\n\nThe first [[Auxiliary Division]] fatality was killed in Rathmore on 11 July 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe [[Headford Ambush]] took place at Barraduff in 1921. Thirty-two IRA volunteers ambushed a train carrying British soldiers. A total of sixteen people died including ten British soldiers, two IRA volunteers and four civilians.\n\n==Geography==\n\nOpinions differ as to the exact region of Sliabh Luachra, but it is generally accepted to refer to the mountainous, rush-filled upland that straddles the border area of Cork, Kerry, and [[County Limerick|Limerick]], including the Kerry parishes of [[Ballymacelligott]], Cordal, [[Brosna, County Kerry|Brosna]], Knocknagoshel, Barraduff, [[Gneeveguilla]], [[Scartaglen]] and [[Rathmore, County Kerry|Rathmore]], the Cork villages of [[Ballydesmond]], [[Kiskeam]], [[Rockchapel]], [[Knocknagree]], Cullen, Boherbue, [[Meelin]], and Freemount, and the Limerick villages of Killeedy[[Tournafulla]], [[Templeglantine]], [[Athea]], [[Mountcollins]] and [[Abbeyfeale]]\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name Sliabh Luachra means \"a mountain of rushes\". However, it is not a single mountain, but a rolling plateau interspersed with what is generally accepted as its seven [[valley|glens]], or 'seacht ngleann Shliabh Luachra', over which various mountain peaks reach heights of 500 metres.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://archive.is/20070708040156/http://www.kennys.ie/Search_Results.aspx?profile=Books&view=single&barcode=0954142519 Kennys.ie \u2013 ''Sliabh Luachra Milestones''] History book by Diarmuid Moynihan\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061108071038/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_hickey_stonemad.html Stone Mad for Music: The Sliabh Luachra Story] (Marino Press, 1999)\n*[http://www.sliabhluachra.com/ ''Bruach Na Carraige''], local cultural project\n\n{{\u00d3 Conchobhair Ciarraighe}}\n{{coord missing|Ireland}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sliabh Luachra}}\n[[Category:Geography of County Cork]]\n[[Category:Geography of County Kerry]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2012}}\n'''Sliabh Luachra''' ({{IPA-ga|\u0283l\u02b2i\u0259v\u02e0 \u02c8l\u032a\u02e0u\u0259x\u027e\u02e0\u0259}}), sometimes anglicised 'Slieve Logher',<ref>Tempan, Paul.

I-840 continues through a predominantly rural area, characterized by rolling hills with moderate grades, and reaches [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]] at an interchange near the community of [[Leiper's Fork, Tennessee|Leiper's Fork]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] and turns east. I-840 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 31]] (US 31) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|2|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]] Less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]] south of Franklin in an interchange that resembles a [[cloverstack interchange]], containing two loop ramps and two underpass ramps that cross I-840 combined together. The route continues through a hilly terrain with several steep grades, and comes to an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31 Alternate (Tennessee)|US 31 Alternate]] and [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee \u2013 Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41 Alternate]] about {{convert|11|mi|km}} later near the community of [[Triune, Tennessee|Triune]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later I-840 crosses [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]] at the top of a large hill, and begins a steep downgrade, with the westbound lanes utilizing a [[truck climbing lane]] over a short distance and crossing into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]]. The route then turns northeast, passing through a relatively flat region, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]] and [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]] in a cloverstack interchange about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later, I-840 crosses into [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]] about {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond this point. The route then turns slightly northeast, and about {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} later reaches its eastern terminus with I-40 west of Lebanon.<ref name=google>{{google maps |url = https://www.google.com/maps/place/I-840,+Tennessee/@36.0861572,-86.596612,66351m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x88647b9afed8536b:0x963e9004ea8fed0f!8m2!3d36.0895955!4d-86.427016 |title = I-840 |access-date = December 18, 2017 |link = no }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Infobox road small\n|state=TN\n|type=SR\n|route=840\n|location=[[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]\u2013[[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]\n|formed=1991\n|deleted=2016\n|length_mi=77.28\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"840hold\"/>\n}}\n\nIn 1975 the Tennessee Highway System Plan issued by TDOT for the next four years first identified the need for an outer beltway around Nashville within the next 20 years.<ref name=FWHA>{{cite book |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation |year = 1995 |volume = Vol. 2 |title = Proposed Route 840 North from Interstate 65 to Interstate 40 West of Nashville in Robertson, Cheatham, Dickson, and Montgomery Counties, Tennessee |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qrM1AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |location = Nashville |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |page =  |id = FHWA-TN-ESI-9501-D |access-date = December 18, 2017 |via = Google Books }}</ref> The SR&nbsp;840 project was initiated in 1986 with the passage of the Better Roads Program in the [[Tennessee General Assembly]].

About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-840 comes to an interchange with I-24 northwest of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]]. This interchange is almost a complete [[cloverleaf interchange|cloverleaf]], containing three loop ramps and one [[overpass|flyover]].

It is a loose remake of [[John Ford]]'s 1937 film ''[[The Hurricane (1937 film)|The Hurricane]]'', itself based on the [[The Hurricane (novel)|1936 novel]] by [[James Norman Hall]] and [[Charles Nordhoff]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the 1920s Charlotte, an American painter, arrives from Boston on the island of Alaya to visit her father, U. S. Navy Captain Bruckner, whom she hasn't seen in quite some time. Bruckner is the U.S. Congress-sanctioned governor of the island. He rules with a stern, patrician, and thoroughly patronizing attitude towards the natives. Charlotte is somewhat taken aback by her father's rigid adherence to the law. She tries to intervene on behalf of Bruckner's charge/houseboy Matangi, who plans to get Bruckner to toss out a harsh penalty issued to a native man who stole a boat \"for love.\" Bruckner refuses, and severely reprimands Matangi, much to Charlotte's dismay.\n\nMatangi is soon anointed the high chief of his island, Alava. Matangi isn't as willing to wholeheartedly accept the edicts of the U.S. forces, particularly if they go against the well-being of his own people.

S. Navy Captain Bruckner, whom she hasn't seen in quite some time. Bruckner is the U.S. Congress-sanctioned governor of the island. He rules with a stern, patrician, and thoroughly patronizing attitude towards the natives. Charlotte is somewhat taken aback by her father's rigid adherence to the law. She tries to intervene on behalf of Bruckner's charge/houseboy Matangi, who plans to get Bruckner to toss out a harsh penalty issued to a native man who stole a boat \"for love.\" Bruckner refuses, and severely reprimands Matangi, much to Charlotte's dismay.\n\nMatangi is soon anointed the high chief of his island, Alava. Matangi isn't as willing to wholeheartedly accept the edicts of the U.S. forces, particularly if they go against the well-being of his own people. His stubbornness quietly enrages Bruckner.\n\nCharlotte wants to stay for a month on the island, chaperoned by Dr. Danielsson and Father Malone, missionaries who reside on Alava. Despite Captain Bruckner's jealousy over his daughter's attraction to Matangi, he agrees to the stay and sails off for a month. Matangi and Charlotte quickly become lovers.

{"title_page": "List of rulers of Lanka", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2017}}\n\n'''Lanka'''  is the name given in [[Hindu mythology]] to the island fortress capital of the legendary demon king [[Hirushawn]] in the epics of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the [[Trikuta Mountains]]. The ancient city of Lankapoop is thought to have been burnt down by [[Bapu]]. After its king, Sarath Somawansa, was killed by [[Hirushawn]] with the help of Hirushawns brother [[Kavish]], the latter was crowned king of Lankapoop. The mythological site of Lank\u0101 is identified with [[Sri Lanka]]. His descendants were said to still rule the kingdom during the period of the [[Pandava]]s. According to the ''Mahabharata'', the Pandava [[Sahadeva]] visited this kingdom during his southern military campaign for the [[rajasuya]] of [[Yudhishthira].Sri lanka has alot of voodoo people and to this day sri lanka gets bullied because of the people of sri lanka are ricers.\n\n== Rulers of Lanka ==\nAccording to both the ''Ramayana'' and the ''Mahabharata'', Lanka was originally ruled by a [[rakshasa]] named Sumali. According to Uttara Kanda, Lanka was originally built by the divine architect Vishwakarma for the gods, but was seized by the brothers, Malyavan, Sumali and Mali. The brothers ruled for thousands of years and invaded the heavens. After suffering a humiliating and disastrous defeat at the hands of Lord Vishnu, the brothers were too ashamed to return to Lanka. Kubera seized control of Lanka and established the [[Yaksha Kingdom]] and his capital was guarded by [[rakshasa]]s. His half-brother Ravana, son of the sage Vishrava and Sumali's daughter ([[Kaikesi]]), fought with Kubera and took Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as king of the [[Rakshasa Kingdom]]. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous [[relief]] in the 12th-century [[Khmer people|Khmer]] temple of [[Angkor Wat]].After Ravana's death, he was succeeded by his brother, Vibhishana.\n\n== Rulers (Demons) ==\n\n# Heti and Praheti were the sea mammals.

The fortress was situated on a plateau between three mountain peaks known as the [[Trikuta Mountains]]. The ancient city of Lankapura is thought to have been burnt down by [[Hanuman]]. After its king, Ravana, was killed by [[Rama]] with the help of Ravana's brother [[Vibhishana]], the latter was crowned king of Lankapura. The mythological site of Lank\u0101 is identified with [[Sri Lanka]]. His descendants were said to still rule the kingdom during the period of the [[Pandava]]s. According to the ''Mahabharata'', the Pandava [[Sahadeva]] visited this kingdom during his southern military campaign for the [[rajasuya]] of [[Yudhishthira]].\n\n== Rulers of Lanka ==\nAccording to both the ''Ramayana'' and the ''Mahabharata'', Lanka was originally ruled by a [[rakshasa]] named Sumali. According to Uttara Kanda, Lanka was originally built by the divine architect Vishwakarma for the gods, but was seized by the brothers, Malyavan, Sumali and Mali. The brothers ruled for thousands of years and invaded the heavens. After suffering a humiliating and disastrous defeat at the hands of Lord Vishnu, the brothers were too ashamed to return to Lanka. Kubera seized control of Lanka and established the [[Yaksha Kingdom]] and his capital was guarded by [[rakshasa]]s. His half-brother Ravana, son of the sage Vishrava and Sumali's daughter ([[Kaikesi]]), fought with Kubera and took Lanka from him. Ravana ruled Lanka as king of the [[Rakshasa Kingdom]]. The battle in Lanka is depicted in a famous [[relief]] in the 12th-century [[Khmer people|Khmer]] temple of [[Angkor Wat]].After Ravana's death, he was succeeded by his brother, Vibhishana.\n\n== Rulers (Demons) ==\n\n# Heti and Praheti were the sea mammals. When brahma made sea of the world when he was making the sea by salt water they disturbed him and so they were cursed by [[Brahma]] to become [[Asura]]s and they formed an Island Kingdom called (Lanka).\n# Vidyutkesha was the son of Heti\n# Sukesha was the son of Vidutkesha\n# [[Malyavan]], [[Sumali]] and Mali were the sons of Sukesha.\n# [[Kubera]] was a [[Yaksha]] King. By the order of lord [[Vishnu]], he remade and ruled [[Lanka]].\n# [[Ravana]] forced his elder brother [[Kubera]] to run away from [[Lanka]] after his penance to [[Brahma]] and [[Shiva]] and became the prince of [[Lanka]] and Sumali again became the King of Lanka. After [[Sumali]]'s death, He became the ruler of [[Lanka]].\n# [[Vibhishana]] after [[Ravana]]'s death and order of lord [[Rama]], He ruled [[Lanka]].\n\n==References==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu mythology]]\n[[Category:Rakshasa in the Ramayana]]\n", "name_user": "2604:3d09:1781:7f00:c0f4:f9cb:1e9:c6dc", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Lanka"}

To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated [[C. Subramaniam]] and [[M. Bhakthavatsalam]], who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet.\n\nAs [[Chief Minister]], Kamaraj removed the family vocation based [[Hereditary Education Policy]] introduced by [[Rajaji]]. The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk no more than three kilometres to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strived to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the [[Midday Meal Scheme]] to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children. Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He introduced free school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds.\n\n[[File:Statue of Kamarajar.jpg|right|thumb|Kamaraj Statue in [[Marina Beach]], [[Chennai]] depicting his contribution to education in the state]]\n[[File:KAMARAJAR Statue infront of KAP Kalyana Mandabam, Hosur.jpg|thumb |Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Statue in Kamaraj Colony, [[Hosur]]]]\nDuring the British regime the education rate was only 7%. But after Kamaraj's reforms it reached 37%. Apart from increasing the number of schools, steps were taken to improve standards of education. To improve standards, the number of working days was increased from 180 to 200; unnecessary holidays were reduced; and syllabi were prepared to give opportunity to various abilities. Kamaraj and Bishnuram Medhi (Governor) took efforts to establish [[IIT Madras]] in 1959.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMajor irrigation schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. Dams and irrigation canals were built across higher [[Bhavani]], Mani Muthar, Aarani, [[Vaigai]], [[Amaravathi Dam|Amaravathi]], [[Sathanur Reservoir|Sathanur]], [[Krishnagiri]], [[Pullambadi]], [[Parambikulam]] and Neyyaru among others. The Lower Bhavani Dam in Erode district brought {{convert|207000|acre|km2}} of land under cultivation. {{convert|45000|acre|km2}} of land benefited from canals constructed from the [[Mettur Dam]]. The Vaigai and Sathanur systems facilitated cultivation across thousands of acres of lands in Madurai and North Arcot districts respectively. Rs 30 crores were planned to be spent for Parambikulam River scheme, and 150 lakhs of acres of lands were brought under cultivation; one third of this (i.e. 56 lakhs of acres of land) received a permanent irrigation facility. In 1957\u201361  1,628 tanks were de-silted under the Small Irrigation Scheme, and 2,000 wells were dug with outlets. Long term loans with 25%  subsidy were given to farmers. In addition farmers who had dry lands were given oil engines and electric pump sets on an instalment basis.\n\nIndustries with huge investments in crores of Rupees were started in his period: [[Neyveli Lignite Corporation]], [[BHEL]] at Trichy, [[Manali Refinery]], Hindustan raw photo film factory at Ooty, surgical instruments factory at Chennai, and a railway coach factory at Chennai were established and in the neighbouring state of Karnataka in a town Kolar Gold Fields he established BEML .

He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign from their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress.\n\nIn 1963 he suggested to Nehru that senior Congress leaders should leave ministerial posts to take up organisational work. This suggestion came to be known as the '''Kamaraj Plan''', which was designed primarily to dispel from the minds of Congressmen the lure of power, creating in its place a dedicated attachment to the objectives and policies of the organisation. Six Union Ministers and six [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Ministers]] including [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Morarji Desai]], [[Biju Patnaik]] and [[S.K. Patil]] followed suit and resigned from their posts. Impressed by Kamaraj's achievements and acumen, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] felt that his services were needed more at the national level.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In a swift move he brought Kamaraj to Delhi as the President of the Indian National Congress. Nehru realised that in addition to wide learning and vision, Kamaraj possessed enormous common sense and pragmatism.

To everyone's surprise, Kamaraj nominated [[C. Subramaniam]] and [[M. Bhakthavatsalam]], who had contested his leadership, to the newly formed cabinet.\n\nAs [[Chief Minister]], Kamaraj removed the family vocation based [[Hereditary Education Policy]] introduced by [[Rajaji]]. The State made immense strides in education and trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk no more than three kilometres to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strived to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the [[Midday Meal Scheme]] to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children. Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. He introduced free school uniforms to weed out caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds.\n\n[[File:Statue of Kamarajar.jpg|right|thumb|Kamaraj Statue in [[Marina Beach]], [[Chennai]] depicting his contribution to education in the state]]\n[[File:KAMARAJAR Statue infront of KAP Kalyana Mandabam, Hosur.jpg|thumb |Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Statue in Kamaraj Colony, [[Hosur]]]]\nDuring the British regime the education rate was only 7%. But after Kamaraj's reforms it reached 37%. Apart from increasing the number of schools, steps were taken to improve standards of education. To improve standards, the number of working days was increased from 180 to 200; unnecessary holidays were reduced; and syllabi were prepared to give opportunity to various abilities. Kamaraj and Bishnuram Medhi (Governor) took efforts to establish [[IIT Madras]] in 1959.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMajor irrigation schemes were planned in Kamaraj's period. Dams and irrigation canals were built across higher [[Bhavani]], Mani Muthar, Aarani, [[Vaigai]], [[Amaravathi Dam|Amaravathi]], [[Sathanur Reservoir|Sathanur]], [[Krishnagiri]], [[Pullambadi]], [[Parambikulam]] and Neyyaru among others. The Lower Bhavani Dam in Erode district brought {{convert|207000|acre|km2}} of land under cultivation. {{convert|45000|acre|km2}} of land benefited from canals constructed from the [[Mettur Dam]]. The Vaigai and Sathanur systems facilitated cultivation across thousands of acres of lands in Madurai and North Arcot districts respectively. Rs 30 crores were planned to be spent for Parambikulam River scheme, and 150 lakhs of acres of lands were brought under cultivation; one third of this (i.e. 56 lakhs of acres of land) received a permanent irrigation facility. In 1957\u201361  1,628 tanks were de-silted under the Small Irrigation Scheme, and 2,000 wells were dug with outlets. Long term loans with 25%  subsidy were given to farmers. In addition farmers who had dry lands were given oil engines and electric pump sets on an instalment basis.\n\nIndustries with huge investments in crores of Rupees were started in his period: [[Neyveli Lignite Corporation]], [[BHEL]] at Trichy, [[Manali Refinery]], Hindustan raw photo film factory at Ooty, surgical instruments factory at Chennai, and a railway coach factory at Chennai were established. Industries such as paper, sugar, chemicals and cement took off during the period.\n\n===First Cabinet===\nKamaraj's council of ministers during his first tenure as Chief Minister (13 April 1954 \u2013 31 March 1957):<ref>[http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table04.pdf A Review of the Madras Legislative Assembly (1952\u20131957)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017181036/http://www.assembly.tn.gov.in/archive/Resumes/review_01assly/table04.pdf |date=17 October 2013 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Kamaraj noticed that the Congress party was slowly losing its vigour.\n[[File:Kamarajar Statue at East Tambaram.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|Kamaraj statue at East Tambaram, Chennai]]\nOn [[Gandhi Jayanti]] day 2 October 1963, he resigned from the post of the Chief Minister. He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign from their posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the Congress.\n\nIn 1963 he suggested to Nehru that senior Congress leaders should leave ministerial posts to take up organisational work. This suggestion came to be known as the '''Kamaraj Plan''', which was designed primarily to dispel from the minds of Congressmen the lure of power, creating in its place a dedicated attachment to the objectives and policies of the organisation. Six Union Ministers and six [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Ministers]] including [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]], [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Morarji Desai]], [[Biju Patnaik]] and [[S.K. Patil]] followed suit and resigned from their posts. Impressed by Kamaraj's achievements and acumen, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] felt that his services were needed more at the national level.{{cn|date=April 2020}} In a swift move he brought Kamaraj to Delhi as the President of the Indian National Congress. Nehru realised that in addition to wide learning and vision, Kamaraj possessed enormous common sense and pragmatism. Kamaraj was elected the President of Indian National Congress on 9 October 1963.<ref>[http://www.dpcc.co.in/inc/history/presidents/k_kamaraj.php K Kamaraj]. dpcc.co.in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518025825/http://www.dpcc.co.in/inc/history/presidents/k_kamaraj.php |date=18 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==National politics==\nAfter Nehru's death in 1964, Kamaraj successfully navigated the party through turbulent times. As the president of INC, he refused to become the next Prime Minister himself and was instrumental in bringing to power two Prime Ministers, [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] in 1964 and Nehru's daughter [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/822847/will-mamata-banerjees-hindi-handicap-hurt-her-national-ambition|title=Will Mamata Banerjee's Hindi handicap hurt her ambition to be prime minister?|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202020139/http://scroll.in/article/822847/will-mamata-banerjees-hindi-handicap-hurt-her-national-ambition|archivedate=2 December 2016}}</ref> For this role, he was widely acclaimed as the \"kingmaker\" during the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nWhen the Congress split in 1969, Kamaraj became the leader of the [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)]] (INC(O)) in Tamil Nadu. The party fared poorly in the [[1971 Indian general election|1971 elections]] amid allegations of fraud by the opposition parties. He remained the leader of INC(O) until his death in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|url=https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= [https://archive.org/details/indiathroughages00mada/page/164 164]|editor=K.S.

He refused to use the Z-level security that was provided to him as the CM of Tamil Nadu and instead travelled with just one police patrol vehicle. He did not marry, did not own any property<ref name=\":1\" /> and was never tempted by power.

They were at the siege of Berlin, where Sargent Dave Loc planted the flag outside the Reichstag. \n\n===Housing Shortage===\nThe passage of the [[G.I. Bill]] at end of World War II caused a housing shortage in the United States, with low- to middle-income families finding few rental property options. The Santa Monica Bay area was especially affected as the opening of [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas Aircraft's]] plant in 1940 and the [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles Airport]] in 1947 led to an increase in housing demand. To combat the housing issue, the [[Federal Housing Authority]] (FHA) \u201ccreated a mortgage insurance program, whose low cost of lending and liberal valuation of land would encourage developers to meet this housing need.\u201d <ref>Cultural Heritage Commission, [http://cityplanning.lacity.org/StaffRpt/CHC/10-6-11/CHC-2011-2002.pdf], ''Los Angeles Department of City Planning,'' October 6, 2011</ref>\n[[File:Lincoln Place Gardens brochure from 1959.jpg|thumb|Lincoln Place Brochure from 1959]]\n\n[[Ralph A. Vaughn]] (1907-2000), an architect trained at the University of Illinois, was the son of a prominent Washington D.C. architect, Roscoe I. Vaughn.  Upon meeting Heth Wharton, they formed Wharton & Vaughn Associates, and were tasked with designing Lincoln Place.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1986, Lincoln Place was family-owned. In 1986, Lincoln Place was purchased by TransAction Companies, Ltd with Robert Bisno and James Coxeter as the two main partners.   \t\nIn 1990, Bisno announced a plan to raze Lincoln Place and develop condos on the site; however in 1996, the LA City Council rejected the development plan which resulted in Bisno filing suit against the city.\nIn June 2001, Aimco became a 50% partner in Lincoln Place; and in August 2003, Aimco Venezia LLC, an Aimco affiliate became 100% owner of Lincoln Place Apartment Homes.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn September 2000, Bisno began a revised development plan which was to include the demolition of 2 buildings and the rehabilitation of the remaining 50.  Approximately 300 families moved out of Lincoln Place during this time with vacant units taken off of the rental market. This was the largest Eviction in Los Angeles History, with only disabled and elderly allowed to remain.\n\nIn May 2002, Amanda Seward working with the Modern Committee of the LA Conservancy filed a nomination for Lincoln Place to be added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  In November of that same year, the City Council re-heard Bisno's condo proposal.  Finding that there was \u201cno substantial evidence\u201d that Lincoln Place was an historic resource, Bisno's plan was approved. This sparked a lawsuit against the city by the Lincoln Place Tenants Association.\n\nBisno filed applications in January 2003 for five demolition permits but was rejected.  He filed a suit against the Department of Building and Safety requesting permits under the [[Ellis Act]]. However, in February 2003, the State Historic Resources Commission determined Lincoln Place was eligible for the National Register. The commission forwarded the nomination and recommendation to the [[Keeper of the Register|Keeper of the National Register]], at which time the file was open for 45 days. During these 45 days, Bisno demolished two buildings. The Keeper returned the nomination asking for additional information.\n\nIn May 2003, permits were issued for five buildings along Lake Street. Several groups, including the California Preservation Foundation, LA Conservancy and the National Organization of Minority Architects filed suit against the City, citing the California Environmental Quality Act and the LA Municipal Code.  They also unsuccessfully appealed the demolition permits with the Building and Safety Commission.  A total of 99 units were demolished.\n\nIn November of that year, the LPTA lost its suit against the City; and in January the preservationists lost their case in trial court.  Both groups appealed.\nIn March 2004, Aimco began asbestos work related to redevelopment of the property. In July 2004, Amanda Seward submitted a nomination requesting that  Lincoln Place be deemed eligible for the California Register of Historic Places. In March, 2004 the Court of Appeal issued an order to prevent further demolition of structures at Lincoln Place. \nFrom 2004 to 2006 Aimco relocated tenants in more than 250 units while providing alternative housing and relocation benefits.  A number of tenants were able to become first time homebuyers as a result of receiving relocation benefits.  In March 2005 Aimco filed a \u201cNotice of Intent to Withdraw\u201d the apartments from the rental market as permitted by the California Ellis Act. Tenants in 289 occupied units were served notices requiring tenants to vacate units within 120 days.\n\nEvicted tenants filed a lawsuit, claiming that \u201cAimco violated conditions of the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] as well as an agreement with the city of L.A. to relocate tenants to other units or properties instead of evicting them.\u201d The [[California Courts of Appeal#Second District|Second District Court of Appeals]] eventually ruled in the tenants\u2019 favor.<ref>[http://www.smdp.com/Articles-c-2009-10-05-62926.113116-Lincoln-Place-landlord-settles-with-tenants.html]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Santa Monica Daily Press,'' 2009</ref>  Of the 147 households engaged in the legal battles, many accepted relocation packages (including funds for moving expenses) offered by Aimco.\n\n==Resolution==\n\n===Historic designation===\nOn August 4, 2005, the California State Historical Resources Commission declared that Lincoln Place was eligible to be placed on the [[California Register of Historical Resources]]. According to the Commission, Lincoln Place exemplified an \"excellent enduring example of both the 'garden city' property type and of [[Modernist architecture]].\"  In addition, the Commission cited the unique site plan and observed that it was one of few surviving prominent examples of postwar middle-income residential architecture.  Subsequently, Aimco applied to the National Park Service to be listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This listing was granted in December 2015.<ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20151231.htm|title=Weekly list of actions taken on properties:  12/21/15 through 12/24/15|date=December 31, 2015|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement===\nIn May 2009, Aimco signed a settlement agreement with Amanda Seward and the 20th Century Architectural Alliance which settled and concluded all claims concerning Lincoln Place. The agreement requires that the Secretary of Interior's standards be followed for historic rehabilitation at Lincoln Place. A total of 696 units will be restored and 99 new units are to be constructed on vacant lots.  In August, 2009 Aimco signed a settlement agreement with the former occupants of the site which allows up to 83 former tenants to return to Lincoln Place.  50 exercised their option to return.\n\nIn May 2010, the Los Angeles City Council approved a settlement reached between Aimco and the City which settled and concluded all claims in connection with Lincoln Place.

According to the Commission, Lincoln Place exemplified an \"excellent enduring example of both the 'garden city' property type and of [[Modernist architecture]].\"  In addition, the Commission cited the unique site plan and observed that it was one of few surviving prominent examples of postwar middle-income residential architecture.  Subsequently, Aimco applied to the National Park Service to be listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  This listing was granted in December 2015.<ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20151231.htm|title=Weekly list of actions taken on properties:  12/21/15 through 12/24/15|date=December 31, 2015|publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement===\nIn May 2009, Aimco signed a settlement agreement with Amanda Seward and the 20th Century Architectural Alliance which settled and concluded all claims concerning Lincoln Place. The agreement requires that the Secretary of Interior's standards be followed for historic rehabilitation at Lincoln Place. A total of 696 units will be restored and 99 new units are to be constructed on vacant lots.  In August, 2009 Aimco signed a settlement agreement with the former occupants of the site which allows up to 83 former tenants to return to Lincoln Place.  50 exercised their option to return.\n\nIn May 2010, the Los Angeles City Council approved a settlement reached between Aimco and the City which settled and concluded all claims in connection with Lincoln Place. The agreement includes City cooperation for permitting and support for funding to make Lincoln Place a model of sustainability and historic preservation.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Lincoln Place Apartment Homes}}\n* [http://www.lincolnplaceapthomes.com/ Lincoln Place Apartment Homes' website]\n\n{{Venice, Los Angeles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lincoln Place Apartment Homes}}\n[[Category:Venice, Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Apartment buildings in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:1950s architecture in the United States]]\n[[Category:Modernist architecture in California]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Los Angeles]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1016:b025:214f:1136:6963:8db:5a9b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory:Fixed)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Place_Apartment_Homes"}
