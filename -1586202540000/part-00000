The city was originally named \"Centralia,\" but was later renamed \"Fargo\" after [[Northern Pacific Railway]] director and [[Wells Fargo]] Express Company founder [[William Fargo]] (1818\u20131881). The area started to flourish after the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the city became known as the \"Gateway to the West.\"\n\nDuring the 1880s, Fargo became the \"divorce capital\" of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] because of lenient [[divorce]] laws.<ref>Riley, G (1991). Divorce: An American Tradition. Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nA major fire struck the city on June 7, 1893, destroying 31 blocks of downtown Fargo, but the city was immediately rebuilt with new buildings made of brick, new streets, and a water system. More than 246 new buildings were built within one year. There were several rumors concerning the cause of the fire.<ref>http://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/fire-1893 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072024/http://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content%2Ffire-1893 |date=July 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe North Dakota Agricultural College was founded in 1890 as [[North Dakota]]'s [[land-grant university]], becoming first accredited by the [[North Central Association]] in 1915. In 1960, NDAC became known as [[North Dakota State University]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1957 Fargo tornado.jpg|thumb|right|F5 tornado as it approaches [[Hector International Airport]], 1957]]\nEarly in the century, the automobile industry flourished, and in 1905, Fargo became home to the ''Pence Automobile Company''.<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.205.</ref>\n\nOn Labor Day in 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited Fargo to lay the cornerstone of the college's new library.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota mysteries & oddities, 2009\u20132010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|year=|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=14|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  To a crowd of 30,000, Roosevelt spoke about his first visit to Fargo 27 years earlier, and credited his experience homesteading in North Dakota for his eventual rise to the presidency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Fargo-Moorhead]] boomed after [[World War II]], and the city grew rapidly despite a [[1957 Fargo tornado|violent tornado in 1957]] that destroyed a large part of the north end of the city. [[Ted Fujita]], famous for his [[Fujita scale|Fujita tornado scale]], analyzed pictures of the Fargo tornado, which helped him develop his ideas for \"wall cloud\" and \"tail cloud.\" These were the first major scientific descriptive terms associated with tornadoes.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.louislamour.com/sackett/index.htm\n|title=Tetsuya Theodore Fujita: 1920\u20131998\n|publisher=The Tornado Project\n|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}</ref> The construction of two interstates ([[Interstate 29 in North Dakota|I-29]] and [[Interstate 94 in North Dakota|I-94]]) revolutionized travel in the region and pushed growth of Fargo to the south and west of the city limits. In 1972, the [[West Acres Shopping Center]], the largest shopping mall in North Dakota, was constructed near the intersection of the two Interstates. This mall became a catalyst for retail growth in the area.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:050@Broadway and Main.JPG|thumb|right|Broadway at Main in downtown Fargo]]\nFargo has continued to expand rapidly but steadily. Since the mid-1980s, the bulk of new residential growth has occurred in the south and southwest areas of the city due to geographic constraints on the north side. The city's major retail districts on the southwest side have likewise seen rapid development.\n\nDowntown Fargo has been [[Gentrification|gentrified]] due in part to investments by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone. Most older neighborhoods, such as Horace Mann, have either avoided decline or been revitalized through housing rehabilitation promoted by planning agencies to strengthen the city's core.\n\nNDSU has grown rapidly into a major research university, and forms a major component of the city's identity and economy. Most students live off-campus in the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood. The university has established a presence downtown through both academic buildings and apartment housing. In addition, NDSU Bison Football has become a major sport following among many area residents.\n\nSince the late 1990s, the Fargo-Moorhead [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates among MSAs in the United States. Coupled with Fargo's low crime rate and the decent supply of affordable housing in the community, this has prompted ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine to rank the city near the top of its annual list of America's most livable cities throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FEMA - 40347 - Flooded neighborhood in Fargo, North Dakota.jpg|thumb|right|Spring flooding in Riverview area of Fargo, 2009]]\nFargo is a core city of the [[Fargo-Moorhead]] metropolitan area, which also includes Moorhead, West Fargo, and Dilworth as well as outlying communities.\n\nFargo sits on the western bank of the [[Red River of the North]] in a flat geographic region known as the [[Red River Valley]]. The Red River Valley resulted from the withdrawal of [[glacier|glacial]] [[Lake Agassiz]], which drained away about 9,300 years ago. The lake sediments deposited from Lake Agassiz made the land around Fargo some of the richest in the world for [[agriculture|agricultural]] uses.\n\nFargo's largest challenge is the seasonal floods due to the rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into [[Lake Winnipeg]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and river ice, as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo's surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating [[2009 Red River flood]], both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection, only a near record flood would cause concern today.\n\nIts location makes the city vulnerable to flooding during seasons with above average precipitation. The Red River's \"minor\" flood stage in Fargo begins at a level of 18 feet, with \"major\" flooding categorized at 30 feet and above. Many major downtown roadways and access to Moorhead are closed off at this level. Record snowfalls late in 1996 led to flooding in 1997, causing the Red to rise to a record crest of 39.5 feet, nearly overtaking city defenses. In 2008\u20132009, significant fall precipitation coupled with a rapid snowmelt in March 2009 caused the Red to rise to a new record level of 40.84 feet, but again Fargo remained safe, in large part due to flood mitigation efforts instituted after the 1997 event and sandbagging efforts by the city residents. Further upgrades were made to city infrastructure and additional resources brought to bear following the 2009 flood, which caused no issues for the city in 2010 despite another rapid melt that caused the Red to rise to 37 feet (which ranks among the top ten highest levels ever recorded). Recent discussions have focused on a $1.5 billion diversion project to channel the Red's water away from the city, but such a project is in the planning stages and being evaluated by various government agencies. As of 2012, Fargo has bought 700 houses in flood-prone areas.<ref>[http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ Fargo lifts the ban on building permits in flood prone areas | WDAY | Fargo, ND] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130217004320/http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ |date=February 17, 2013}}.

In 1968, the library moved into a new facility as part of urban renewal efforts in the downtown area.  The original 1968 building was demolished and replaced with a new library which opened in 2009. In addition, Fargo Public Library operates the Dr. James Carlson Library in south Fargo, and the Northport branch in north Fargo.  In 2002 and 2006, the Southpointe and Northport Branches were opened serving the city's south and north sides. The Dr. James Carlson Library, which replaced the earlier Southpointe Branch, opened to the public on November 16, 2007. A new downtown Main Library opened April 25, 2009.  The Fargo Public Library is headquartered in downtown Fargo.  In 2014, over 1 million items were checked out from Fargo Public Library.  \"Books and magazines made up nearly half of the total and digital media and other non-print items made up more than a third. The rest are inter-library loans and renewals,\" according to Melisa Duncan, a library spokeswoman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inforum.com/news/3655509-fargo-library-breaks-record|title=Fargo Library breaks record|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nFargo offers a wide variety of cultural opportunities for a city of its size. This is likely due, in part, to the presence of three universities in the area. Most theatre and events are either promoted or produced by the universities, although there are several private theatre companies in the city including Fargo-Moorhead Community Theatre (FMCT), Theatre 'B' in downtown Fargo, Ursa Major Productions, Music Theatre Fargo Moorhead, Tin Roof Theatre Company, The Entertainment Company and others.

The city was originally named \"Centralia,\" but was later renamed \"Fargo\" after [[Northern Pacific Railway]] director and [[Wells Fargo]] Express Company founder [[William Fargo]] (1818\u20131881). The area started to flourish after the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railroad and the city became known as the \"Gateway to the West.\"\n\nDuring the 1880s, Fargo became the \"divorce capital\" of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] because of lenient [[divorce]] laws.<ref>Riley, G (1991). Divorce: An American Tradition. Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nA major fire struck the city on June 7, 1893, destroying 31 blocks of downtown Fargo, but the city was immediately rebuilt with new buildings made of brick, new streets, and a water system. More than 246 new buildings were built within one year. There were several rumors concerning the cause of the fire.<ref>http://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content/fire-1893 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705072024/http://library.ndsu.edu/fargo-history/?q=content%2Ffire-1893 |date=July 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe North Dakota Agricultural College was founded in 1890 as [[North Dakota]]'s [[land-grant university]], becoming first accredited by the [[North Central Association]] in 1915. In 1960, NDAC became known as [[North Dakota State University]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:1957 Fargo tornado.jpg|thumb|right|F5 tornado as it approaches [[Hector International Airport]], 1957]]\nEarly in the century, the automobile industry flourished, and in 1905, Fargo became home to the ''Pence Automobile Company''.<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.205.</ref>\n\nOn Labor Day in 1910, [[Theodore Roosevelt]] visited Fargo to lay the cornerstone of the college's new library.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota mysteries & oddities, 2009\u20132010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|year=|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=14|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  To a crowd of 30,000, Roosevelt spoke about his first visit to Fargo 27 years earlier, and credited his experience homesteading in North Dakota for his eventual rise to the presidency.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Fargo-Moorhead]] boomed after [[World War II]], and the city grew rapidly despite a [[1957 Fargo tornado|violent tornado in 1957]] that destroyed a large part of the north end of the city.

In 1972, the [[West Acres Shopping Center]], the largest shopping mall in North Dakota, was constructed near the intersection of the two Interstates. This mall became a catalyst for retail growth in the area.\n\n===Recent history===\n[[File:050@Broadway and Main.JPG|thumb|right|Broadway at Main in downtown Fargo]]\nFargo has continued to expand rapidly but steadily. Since the mid-1980s, the bulk of new residential growth has occurred in the south and southwest areas of the city due to geographic constraints on the north side. The city's major retail districts on the southwest side have likewise seen rapid development.\n\nDowntown Fargo has been [[Gentrification|gentrified]] due in part to investments by the city and private developers in the Renaissance Zone. Most older neighborhoods, such as Horace Mann, have either avoided decline or been revitalized through housing rehabilitation promoted by planning agencies to strengthen the city's core.\n\nNDSU has grown rapidly into a major research university, and forms a major component of the city's identity and economy. Most students live off-campus in the surrounding Roosevelt neighborhood. The university has established a presence downtown through both academic buildings and apartment housing. In addition, NDSU Bison Football has become a major sport following among many area residents.\n\nSince the late 1990s, the Fargo-Moorhead [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates among MSAs in the United States. Coupled with Fargo's low crime rate and the decent supply of affordable housing in the community, this has prompted ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine to rank the city near the top of its annual list of America's most livable cities throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:FEMA - 40347 - Flooded neighborhood in Fargo, North Dakota.jpg|thumb|right|Spring flooding in Riverview area of Fargo, 2009]]\nFargo is a core city of the [[Fargo-Moorhead]] metropolitan area, which also includes Moorhead, West Fargo, and Dilworth as well as outlying communities.\n\nFargo sits on the western bank of the [[Red River of the North]] in a flat geographic region known as the [[Red River Valley]]. The Red River Valley resulted from the withdrawal of [[glacier|glacial]] [[Lake Agassiz]], which drained away about 9,300 years ago. The lake sediments deposited from Lake Agassiz made the land around Fargo some of the richest in the world for [[agriculture|agricultural]] uses.\n\nFargo's largest challenge is the seasonal floods due to the rising water of the Red River, which flows from the United States into [[Lake Winnipeg]] in [[Manitoba]], Canada. The Red flows northward, which means melting snow and river ice, as well as runoff from its tributaries, often create ice dams causing the river to overflow. Fargo's surrounding Red River Valley terrain is essentially flat, leading to overland flooding. Since the potentially devastating [[2009 Red River flood]], both Fargo and Moorhead have taken great strides in flood protection, only a near record flood would cause concern today.\n\nIts location makes the city vulnerable to flooding during seasons with above average precipitation. The Red River's \"minor\" flood stage in Fargo begins at a level of 18 feet, with \"major\" flooding categorized at 30 feet and above. Many major downtown roadways and access to Moorhead are closed off at this level. Record snowfalls late in 1996 led to flooding in 1997, causing the Red to rise to a record crest of 39.5 feet, nearly overtaking city defenses. In 2008\u20132009, significant fall precipitation coupled with a rapid snowmelt in March 2009 caused the Red to rise to a new record level of 40.84 feet, but again Fargo remained safe, in large part due to flood mitigation efforts instituted after the 1997 event and sandbagging efforts by the city residents. Further upgrades were made to city infrastructure and additional resources brought to bear following the 2009 flood, which caused no issues for the city in 2010 despite another rapid melt that caused the Red to rise to 37 feet (which ranks among the top ten highest levels ever recorded). Recent discussions have focused on a $1.5 billion diversion project to channel the Red's water away from the city, but such a project is in the planning stages and being evaluated by various government agencies. As of 2012, Fargo has bought 700 houses in flood-prone areas.<ref>[http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ Fargo lifts the ban on building permits in flood prone areas | WDAY | Fargo, ND] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130217004320/http://www.wday.com/event/article/id/71153/ |date=February 17, 2013}}.

That dominance has decreased substantially in recent decades.

Davies High School]], and an [[alternative high school]] (Woodrow Wilson). The original high school in the city was the  [[Central High School (Fargo, North Dakota)|Central High School]].\n\nThe [[West Fargo Public Schools]] system serves the southwestern part of the city, in addition to West Fargo itself and the surrounding communities of [[Horace, North Dakota|Horace]] and [[Harwood, North Dakota|Harwood]].\n\nIn addition to public schools, a number of private schools also operate in the city. The John Paul II Catholic Schools Network operates Holy Spirit Elementary, Nativity Elementary, Sullivan Middle School, and [[Shanley High School]]. Additionally, the [[Oak Grove Lutheran School]] and Park Christian School (which is in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]) serve grades pre-K through 12, while Grace Lutheran School serves grades pre-K through 8.\n\n===Higher education===\n[[File:NDSU Campus 1.JPG|thumb|right|Old Main on the campus of [[North Dakota State University]]]]\n\nFargo is home to [[North Dakota State University]] (NDSU), which has over 14,500 students. NDSU was founded in 1890 as the state [[Land-grant university|land grant university]] focusing on agriculture, engineering and science, but has since branched out to cover many other fields of study. NDSU, along with [[Minnesota State University Moorhead]] and [[Concordia College (Moorhead)|Concordia College]] in Moorhead, form the Tri-College University system of Fargo-Moorhead. Students can take classes at any of the three institutions. These three colleges also form a vibrant student-youth community of over 25,000.\nNDSCS-Fargo is a campus of [[North Dakota State College of Science]]. Located in the Skills and Technology Training Center on 19th Avenue North in Fargo, NDSCS-Fargo serves as the home to academic programming and non-credit training.\n\nFargo is also home to several private collegiate institutions, including [[Rasmussen College]], a branch location of the [[University of Mary]], and Masters Baptist College operated by Fargo Baptist Church.  The [[University of Jamestown]]'s Doctor of Physical Therapy program is based in Fargo.\n\n===Libraries===\nThe Fargo Public Library was established in 1900 and for many years was housed in a Carnegie-funded building. In 1968, the library moved into a new facility as part of urban renewal efforts in the downtown area.  The original 1968 building was demolished and replaced with a new library which opened in 2009. In addition, Fargo Public Library operates the Dr. James Carlson Library in south Fargo, and the Northport branch in north Fargo.  In 2002 and 2006, the Southpointe and Northport Branches were opened serving the city's south and north sides. The Dr. James Carlson Library, which replaced the earlier Southpointe Branch, opened to the public on November 16, 2007. A new downtown Main Library opened April 25, 2009.  The Fargo Public Library is headquartered in downtown Fargo.  In 2014, over 1 million items were checked out from Fargo Public Library.  \"Books and magazines made up nearly half of the total and digital media and other non-print items made up more than a third. The rest are inter-library loans and renewals,\" according to Melisa Duncan, a library spokeswoman.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inforum.com/news/3655509-fargo-library-breaks-record|title=Fargo Library breaks record|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nFargo offers a wide variety of cultural opportunities for a city of its size.

''[http://users.pandora.be/fietser/fotos/VM4SD-FVDWsm.pdf The Velomobile as a Vehicle for more Sustainable Transportation]'' {{ISSN|1651-0194}}, Retrieved on 23 November 2007.</ref> They are similar to [[recumbent bicycle]]s and [[tricycle]]s, but with a full [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]] (aerodynamic or weather protective shell). A fairing may be added to a non-faired cycle, or the fairing may be an integral part of the structure, [[monocoque]] like that of an airplane. The term velomobile can be thought of as similar in scope to the cycle (pedal vehicle) world as the term automobile is to the automotive world.\n\nThey are not to be confused with purpose-built for racing or speed records fully fared vehicles with two wheels, generally called [[streamliner]]s. Streamliners have set many speed and distance records.<ref>[http://ihpva.org/hpvarech.htm records]</ref> Though fast in their own right, velomobiles are considered much more streetable machines.  Using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use, including the ability to stop and start unaided, better stability, cross-wind handling, etc., though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines (three or more wheels) have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points.<ref>[https://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/aero/aerodynamics.htm A good discussion on bicycle wheel aerodynamics is here.]</ref>  In practice though, velomobiles continue to be close to their two-wheel cousins in performance.<ref>[https://lonniemorse.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/streamliners-and-velomobiles/ velomobiles continue to be close to their 2 wheel cousins in performance]</ref> \n\nThere are few velomobile manufacturers; some are home-built. Some models have the operator's head exposed; this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision, hearing, and some cooling, with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic. Fully enclosed machines can suffer from heat or humidity issues as well as potential noise issues. \n\nThe typical drive train<ref>[http://mccraw.co.uk/milan-velomobile-drivetrain-details/ typical drive train]</ref> of a velomobile is not unlike a bicycle or recumbent. It will consist of a front [[bottom bracket]] with one or more [[Crankset#Chainring|chainrings]], and a rear [[Derailleur gears|derailleur]].  Depending on the configuration of the velomobile there may be any number of idler pulleys, and chaintubes<ref>[http://www.ihpva.org/Projects/tstrike/building/plasticguide.htm chaintubes]</ref> along the drive train to manage and protect the chain. One of the defining characteristics of most velomobiles is that the [[Bicycle drivetrain systems|chain and drivetrain components]] are protected from weather and the road.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fantom2sits.jpg|thumb|A two-seat open-top [[Fantom]]]]\n[[File:YellowPPV.jpeg|thumb|A two-seat [[People Powered Vehicle]]]]\n[[File:frontquarter.jpg|thumb|Cab-Bike]]\n[[File:Nzleitras.jpg|thumb|Leitras]]\n[[File:Waw020.jpg|thumb|Waw]]\n[[File:Vehicule faible consommation electrique.jpg|thumb|Leiba Xstream electric (eco marathon)]]\n[[File:Velomobile crosses Chambers jeh.jpg|thumb|In use in New York, 2018]]\nBefore World War I, Charles Mochet built a small four-wheeled 'bike'-car for his son. Mochet built many models of small vehicles called \"[[Velocar]]\". Some models had two seats, most were pedal powered, but as the years went by, many were fitted with small engines.<ref>[http://www.cyclegenius.com/history.php The Real History of the Recumbent Bicycle] Retrieved on 26 March 2008.</ref>  Mochet Velocars use a thin wood/plywood body on a steel frame.\n\nSome other early velomobiles use a fabric body or \"skin\" sewn to fit loosely on closely spaced wires or tubes, then painted or \"doped\" with a liquid that dries and shrinks the fabric to a tight fit on the wire/tube supports.  The approach was used widely on early [[airplanes]], and has the advantage of light weight with relatively low-technology materials.  It is sometimes called \"bird cage\" construction because the support looks similar to closely spaced wires used in construction of [[bird cage]]s, and because the wire/tube support outline shows through once the fabric is tight.  Some disadvantages of this approach are the cost of construction, due to the many interconnected supports; and that the shape is that of many flat panels, which limits smoothness of the skin and thus limits the aerodynamics.\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[People Powered Vehicle]] was produced. It was a two-seat, \"sociable\" tandem with a steel sub frame and molded plastic body. It was well designed and weighed something over {{convert|50|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}; a recently restored version weighs {{convert|59|kg|lbs|abbr=on|disp=or}}.  However, it had flaws in the execution that doomed it as a practical, everyday vehicle. Positive features, such as easily adjustable and comfortable seats, independent pedalling for both passenger and driver, adequate cargo space and relatively good weather protection, could not overcome the negative features, such as a complex, heavy and badly spaced three-speed gear box, ineffective brakes, and pedals that slid on sleeve bearings on steel shafts, which made it difficult to use as an everyday vehicle.\n\nIn [[Sweden]], a two-seat design called [[Fantom]] was sold as blueprints and became very popular; over 100,000 copies of the blueprints were sold, but few were actually completed.  The downfall of these early 'bicycle' cars came when the economy improved and people chose motorised transport.\n\n==Modern/contemporary velomobiles==\nBuilders continued to make \"one-off\" velomobiles, but for a time none were available commercially.  In the 1970s, [[Carl-Georg Rasmussen]]\nrediscovered ''Fantomen''; he redesigned it and in 1983 started selling a production version called [[Leitra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fyens.dk/indland/Ufo-med-pedalmotor/artikel/1323680|title=Ufo med pedalmotor|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>  Leitra velomobiles have been in continuous production since then (as of 2017), with current models evolved/improved from the originals.\n\nThere are many ways to build a velomobile.  One modern design is \"body-on-frame\", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body.  A standard cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with special fittings to mount the body; the use of special fittings tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight.  Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it does not need to be self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames.  Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used.  However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.\n\nAnother modern design is the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]], using aluminum sheet formed and riveted to make the fairing and the structure in one piece.  This approach is sometimes called [[monocoque]] or \"unit\" construction; it was used in airplanes before 1920 and has been used commonly in automobiles since the 1970s.  Labor costs to build an Alleweder are significant due to the many rivets and rivet holes.  Also, the choices of aerodynamic shapes are limited by the formability of the aluminum sheet.  That said, aluminum is relatively inexpensive, and as of 2017 Alleweders can be often be bought for less than other designs; they can also be bought as kits, to reduce out-of-pocket cost.  Aluminum can also be repaired relatively easily, and aluminum, which is homogeneous, can be recycled more easily than many composite materials.\n\nAnother common modern design is a monocoque shell, often made of [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] or \"FRP\", plus sub-frames of welded aluminum tubes.  FRP can be used to produce a wide range of shapes, and thus can improve aerodynamics over approaches such as \"birdcage\" and aluminum-sheet monocoque.  FRP can also use fibers with high strength-to-weight ratio that in velomobiles can save several kilograms compared to other designs.  A wide range of fibers may be used, but those which reduce weight while retaining strength and toughness often increase the price significantly\u2014e.g., a premium of 1000 Euros to save 3&nbsp;kg.  In addition, it is often hard to segregate and recycle the FRP materials.  But despite the cost and other issues, the aerodynamic and weight advantages mean that (as of 2017) monocoque FRP is a common way to build velomobiles.\n\nAs of 2017, most velomobiles are tricycles with two front wheels.  A tricycle has the advantage over a bicycle that it does not fall over when stopped.  In addition, when a cross-wind hits a fairing, it makes a big force; faired tricycles are less likely to get blown over than faired bicycles.  Although three wheels have practical advantages, they also have more aerodynamic drag than two wheels, so land speed record cycles are often bicycles.  Although four wheels were used as far back as the Velocar, they are not today common.  As of 2017, there is at least one 4-wheel production model, the [[QuattroVelo]].  Four wheels tends to further hurt aerodynamics and weight compared to three; but for a given width, four wheels is much more laterally stable than three wheels.  Also, four wheels can be placed in a way that increases luggage capacity a lot compared to three-wheel designs.\n\nMost velomobiles drive the rear wheel(s).  This approach is simple and can often use many standard bicycle parts.  Velomobiles with two rear wheels may drive just one wheel, or may drive both.  Driving a single wheel is the simplest and lightest approach.  Driving both wheels can improve traction but also increases complexity, cost, and weight.  A solid axle may be used, but increases friction/drag in corners and thus can slow down the vehicle.  One alternative is a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], which is the approach used in most cars.  A second alternative is to use a pair of ratchets, where the slower wheel is driven and the faster wheel coasts.  Rear drive often uses \"idler\" pulleys to route the chain; front-wheel drive can eliminate idlers, so offers less friction and also less weight.  It can also increase luggage capacity.  However, front drive with two front wheels uses some non-standard components, and as of 2017 is used only rarely.\n\nAs with other cycles, a velomobile may use suspension.  Suspension tends to improve rider comfort, and can also improve speed\u2014it takes energy to \"bounce\" the velomobile and rider, so a suspension can reduce the energy lost to bouncing.  However, suspension adds cost, weight, and maintenance.  Common velomobile designs include no suspension, front-only suspension, and front+rear suspension.\n\nAs of 2017, there are several commercial makers of velomobiles.  At the same time, there are still many \"one-off\" makers.  Individual designs (both one-off and production) emphasize specific features.  For example, some emphasize aerodynamics and light weight to improve average speed, even if cost, ease of entry/exit, comfort, and other \"practical vehicle\" attributes are reduced.  By analogy, many automobile makers make performance cars with limited seating and cargo and worse emissions and fuel economy.  In contrast, other velomobile designs sacrifice performance features in order to improve cost, entry/exit, comfort, carrying capacity, and so on.  By analogy, many automobile makers offer cargo vans.  As of 2017, individual makers sometimes offer models spanning a range of features\u2014for example, there are Milan models used in racing but also a Milan \"cargo\" model with enough luggage volume to carry a (not-pedaling) human passenger and other bulky items.\n\nAll current (2017) velomobiles are produced in low volume, with \"big\" makers producing one or a few velomobiles per week.  Velomobiles use some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles, and thus made in low volume.  The use of \"more parts\" (e.g., 3 wheels instead of 2) and \"more low-volume\" parts makes velomobiles more expensive.  The only attempt at a mass-produced velomobile, which was in the mid-1980s, flopped.  This was the [[Sinclair C5]].  The C5 was a delta trike (one front, two rear wheels) with electric assist designed to be mass-produced and sold for a low price.  The C5 was poorly designed; it was heavy, had only one gear and had no adjustment for the distance between the pedals and the seat, which is important to get a comfortable pedalling position.\n\nA concept and a potential assessment concerning low-cost velomobiles for daily short trips as well as strategies for reaching a critical lot size for mass production was the subject of a research project called RegInnoMobil.<ref>[http://www.buschbacher.at/reginnomobilen.html Research project \"RegInnoMobil\" about low-cost velomobiles for short daily trips] Retrieved on 19 January 2010.</ref>\n\nVelomobiles have also been used in [[Australian HPV Super Series]] since 1985, and more recently, other events in Australia like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]], the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], and the [[Victorian HPV Series]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe Milan was used by [[Christian von Ascheberg]], current record holder in the 24 hours (1219&nbsp;km) and 1000&nbsp;km (19h27m) category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whpva.org/land.html#380|title=Records-Land - World Human Powered Vehicle Association|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whpva.org/land.html#390|title=Records-Land - World Human Powered Vehicle Association|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nin 2018 [https://www.facebook.com/dave.lewis.9803 Dave Lewis] set a new race record at the [http://www.bikesebring.org/raceresults.php Sebring 24 hour race] using a DF velomobile made by ''[https://www.intercitybike.nl/  Intercitybike.nl]''    Velomobiles also competed in the ultra endurance [http://photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race/  Trans Am Bike race] and came in 1st (setting a new record) and 4th places.  1st place was [https://www.facebook.com/velonaut.swiss Marcel Graber]   and 4th [https://www.facebook.com/dave.lewis.9803 Dave Lewis] the full results can be found [https://transambikerace.com/results/  here - though at the time of this writing it is only current through 2017]\n\n== Comparison to other cycle types ==\nThe velomobile fairing adds weight compared to standard upright cycles or unfaired recumbent cycles.  For a given terrain, the added weight demands lower gearing and makes the velomobile slower climbing hills than its unfaired counterpart.\n\nSome velomobile fairings are mainly for weather protection.  However, if the velomobile fairing is substantially streamlined, then improved aerodynamics means the speeds on flats and down hills may be substantially higher than its unfaired counterpart, and often enough faster to make up for the slower climbing due to weight.\n\nAn aerodynamic fairing must be well-shaped, but minimizing the [[frontal area]] of the velomobile is also important to reduced drag: a fairing with half the frontal area may approach half the air drag.  In turn, aerodynamic velomobiles use a laid-back or [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbent]] riding position, with the rider's head much lower than on regular bicycles.  In turn, velomobile is much easier to accidentally \"hide\" behind a car or road-side shrubbery, fences, etc.\n\nVelomobile bodies are typically light enough that the center of mass is similar to the center of mass on an unfaired recumbent cycle.  This makes cornering stability similar to similar unfaired cycles.  However, minimizing velomobile width also contributes to reduced frontal area and thus drag; so there is an additional incentive to make the velomobile narrow.  The narrowest velomobiles are only slightly wider than the rider's shoulders, and so the width approaches that of an upright bicycle.  However, an upright bicycle still has a significantly narrower \"useful\" width, as the road contact is in the center and so the rider's hands/elbows/etc. might overhang the edge of the roadway or path without causing problems.  In contrast, the wheel track of a velomobile is very nearly as wide as the vehicle itself, and so cannot overhang the edge.\n\nAs of 2017, most velomobiles use a tadpole recumbent [[tricycle]] configuration \u2014 mainly to reduce component weight and improve wheel aerodynamics.  However, some use a four-wheel or [[quadracycle]] configuration.  The extra wheel significantly improves cornering stability and can also improve luggage capacity.  As of 2017 there are not many four-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings, but there are a few, and some riders report speeds are close to three-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings.\n\nTwo-wheel \"streamliner\" configurations can have much less aerodynamic drag: wheels are hard to make aerodynamic; each wheel entry/exit to the fairing adds drag; and velomobiles with two front wheels are necessarily wider or longer than the rider, while two-wheel streamliners can be barely wider than the rider.  A common way to describe aerodynamic drag is \"[[Frontal area|CdA]]\"; in one comparison of racing cycles, there were several two-wheel streamliners with less than half the CdA drag of the best three-wheeler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPVlog/VehicleDrags.html|title=Vehicle Drags|author=Greg Kolodziejzyk|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref>  Air drag is most significant for high-speed events; as of 2016, the world record for a 200-metre sprint on near-level ground is about 145&nbsp;km/h for a two-wheel streamliner and about 120&nbsp;km/h for any vehicle with more than two wheels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ihpva.org/hpvarecl.htm|title=IHPVA Official Speed Records|publisher=International Human Powered Vehicle Association|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> meaning the two-wheel vehicle was about 20% faster.  Aerodynamic power is roughly cubic in speed, so at lower speeds the difference is much less pronounced.  At the same time, two-wheel streamliners require a way to stay upright when stopped and at very low speed, and are more sensitive to blowing over in cross-winds.  These factors limit the use of streamliners, despite their aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe fairing on a velomobile sometimes makes it more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle.  The effect of cross-winds is complicated because the force of the wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle.  \"Wind steer\" can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line.  Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall.  For example, it is common for [[Time trial bicycle|time-trial bicycle]]s to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind.  Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design.  For example, a longer \"tail\" on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the steered wheels and so an improve stability in side winds.  A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more [[Skin friction drag|skin drag]]), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.\n\nVelomobiles with fairings that are mainly for weather protection can use a more upright seating position.  This tends to improve both the ability to see and be seen.  However, to retain stability against tipping (both cornering and cross-winds), the wheel track needs to be wider than a comparable velomobile with a low seating position.  In turn, this may make the velomobile quite a bit wider than a conventional cycle.\n\n\"Weather\" protection includes cold and wet, but also shading from sun.  Since the rider is doing work, it is typically desirable to have at least some cooling.  Many velomobiles have vents and ducts which allow cooling while keeping out water; and the ducts/vents may be closed or covered in cold weather so the rider can stay comfortable even without a secondary heat source.  In warm and hot weather, the fairing provides sun protection, but blocks the rider from cooling air, and so may be much warmer for a given level of effort.  In some situations, a rider's power output (for any type of cycle) is limited by body temperature, and the worse cooling of a velomobile can limit the rider's power output more than on an unfaired cycle.  With an aerodynamic fairing, the velomobile rider at reduced power output may still be faster than an unfaired cycle, due to the lower aerodynamic drag.\n\nVelomobiles for cargo use often have heavy frames to carry load, plus the weight of the cargo itself.  In turn, the weight of the fairing may be relatively less important.  Also, bulky loads often have poor aerodynamics, and so the quality of aerodynamics of the fairing is less important.  This may enable use of a fairing which in hot weather can be converted to a canopy.  A canopy provides no aerodynamic benefits, but improves cooling compared to a faired configuration, while also reducing sun exposure compared to riding without a canopy.  Thus, a \"high speed\" velomobile may benefit most from better aerodynamics, even when aerodynamics hurts rider cooling; while at the same time a \"high load\" velomobile may benefit most from improved cooling (to maximize power output) even if that hurts aerodynamics.\n\nThe steered wheels on a velomobile will hit the fairing if steered sharply enough.  Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for aerodynamics and width.  Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse [[turning circle]] than an equivalent unfaired cycle.  In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle.  Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, but it is hard to build a stable vehicle using only [[Steering#Rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]].  The [https://www.idmoove.com/de/ Velayo] uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it is produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles [[Four-wheel steering|steered all wheels]]; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels.  However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.\n\nA velomobile's fairing shields the drivetrain from weather, as well as the rider.  Drivetrain maintenance is often reduced compared to other cycles, especially unfaired bicycles, where the front wheel kicks up grit-containing dust, mud, and dirty water that lands directly on the chain and increases the rate of abrasive wear on the drivetrain\u2014including chain and sprockets, but sometimes also derailleurs.  The fairing of a velomobile tends to limit both the amount and the kinds of grit landing on the drivetrain.  Some cycles use tooth-belt drive, which is less affected by grit, is quieter than a chain, and may be lighter.  However, belts are only available in pre-selected sizes.  Many recumbent cycles, including most velomobiles, have a long drivetrain for which no suitable tooth belts are available.\n\nVelomobiles are significantly bulkier than conventional cycles.  Further, the bodywork typically cannot be disassembled much, whereas conventional cycles often can be disassembled to fit in a box or bag of dimensions similar to the frame.  In turn, this makes velomobiles more difficult to transport.\n\nVelomobiles are often built using some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles or even specific to a particular make or model.  In addition, the bodywork is large and may be around half the weight of a velomobile.  Thus, to reduce weight, the body is often made of lighter but more expensive materials.  Also, production volumes are low, so for both parts and labor there are not benefits of mass production\u2014as of 2017, many velomobile makers have yearly production on the order of tens or maybe a few hundred velomobiles.  Taken together, these factors mean velomobiles are often much more expensive than other cycle types.\n\nAs an example of prices and price/weight tradeoffs, as of April 2017 the maker Trisled offers their \"Rotovelo\" model either with a [[Rotational molding|rotational molded]] plastic fairing or with a carbon fiber fairing (as well as some other weight-saving changes).  The body shapes and underlying framework are similar; the rotational-molded version weighs 33 kilograms and has a list price of Au$6500,<ref>{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-2|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> while the carbon fiber version weighs 20 kilograms and has a list price of Au$10900.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo Carbon|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-carbon|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the cycle-related infrastructure design is based on the typical configuration of an upright bicycle.  For example, multi-modal transportation such as bike/train/bike routes often use bicycle racks in the train, and the dimensions of racks and also the train ingress/egress assume a conventional cycle.  Similarly, cycle paths often have bollards or S-bend paths to prevent motor vehicle entry, and the entry is often spaced for upright bicycles, but may be too narrow or require too sharp of a turn to allow through some velomobiles.\n\n== Electric assisted velomobiles ==\n{{Anchor|Hybrid velomobile}}\nSome velomobiles have been converted to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver's leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared hub motors (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive hub motors (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but mid-drive units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nWhile an electric-assist unit does add extra weight to the velomobile,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t17956-leiba-x-stream-electric-iut-aisne|title=velomobile electric leiba X stream  (IUT Aisne)|publisher=}}</ref> it is somewhat offset by the flexibility it also provides, especially during hill climbs and stop-and-go traffic. Due to vastly better aerodynamics of velomobiles the range of a similar electric assist unit and similar battery in a velomobile can be about 50% to 100% higher compared to upright bicycles or unfaired recumbents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn events like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]] and the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], there are entire categories dedicated to electric and other hybrid powered velomobiles.\n\nThe legal definition of \"bicycle\" often includes velomobiles, but [[Electric bicycle laws|laws covering cycles with electric assist]] vary widely across countries and often within a country and even between cities in a region.  For example, a specific vehicle may be a \"bicycle\" in one area, a \"low-speed pedal-assisted cycle\" in another area, and a \"moped\" in yet a third.  Similarly, going from 3 wheels to 4 wheels can change the category of an otherwise identical vehicle.  One reason for the varying treatment is that many laws are older than widespread use of power-assisted velomobiles and so the laws were not written to consider such vehicles.  In some areas, laws are being rewritten to include power-assist velomobiles and to harmonize treatment with nearby laws.\n\n==DIY (do it yourself) velomobiles==\nWith a growing [[DIY]]-community{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly \"[[green energy]]\", some [[hobby]]ists have endeavored to build their own velomobiles from kits, sourced components, or from scratch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Mar2005.pdf |title=ESSN-Mar2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-19}}</ref> When compared to similar sized commercial velomobiles, the DIY velomobiles tend to be less expensive.\n\nProbably the most built velomobile kits are the various models of the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]] made from prefabricated aluminium sheet metal due to its affordable price. Some velomobile manufacturers offer their models as kits for self-assembly (R\u00e4derwerk Milan Mk2 + Milan SL, Beyss Go-One Evo K + Go-One Evo Ks, [http://www.alligt.nl/bodies/alleweder-a9.html Alleweder A9/Sunrider Mk2] for instance) at reduced price.\n\n==Velomobile and recumbent Internet communities==\nMany amateur velomobile builders are also recumbent bike riders.  In more recent years many online velomobile groups, some of them focusing on specific regions, have appeared, on Facebook and on other platforms.  Engaging actively in those communities is probably the best way to get informed and eventually own a velomobile.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bicycle drum brake]]\n* [[Cycle rickshaw]]\n* [[Outline of cycling]]\n* [[Quadracycle]]\n* [[Victorian HPV Series|HPV Racing, Victoria Australia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/forumdisplay.php?f=15 Bent Rider Online Forums: Velomobiles]\n* [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/09/the-velomobile-high-tech-bike-or-low-tech-car.html Low Tech Magazine \u2013 The Velomobile: High tech bike or low tech car?]\n* [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/10/electric-velomobiles.html Low Tech Magazine \u2013 Electric Velomobiles: as Fast and Comfortable as Automobiles, but 80 times more Efficient]\n* [http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t17956-leiba-x-stream-electric-iut-aisne forum velomobile and bentrider]\n*[http://wood-velomobile.webnode.nl/links-/ Wood Velomobile]\n\n== Velomobile manufacturers ==\n*http://www.akkurad.com/velomobile.html (Alleweder)\n*http://www.flevelo.com (Orca)\n*http://www.go-one.de (Go one, Alpha 7)\n*https://www.intercitybike.nl/en (DF)\n*https://www.idmoove.com/de/ (Velayo, Messerschmitt)\n*http://www.katanga.eu (WAW)\n*http://www.leiba.de\n*http://www.drymershop.nl (Mango, Hilgo)\n*http://trisled.com.au (Rotovelo, Overzealous)\n*http://en.velomobiel.nl (Quattrovelo, Quest, Strada)\n*http://velomobil.eu (Milan)\n*http://velomobiel.ro (Alpha 7, Quest, Strada, Libelle)\n*http://www.velomobilize.at (Velayo)\n*https://velomtek.com (VX2)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Human-powered vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Cycle types]]\n[[Category:Human-powered vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=November 2015}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2015}}\n}}\n[[File:Red 3-wheel Velomobile.jpg|thumb|360px|Three-wheeled Velomobile]]\nA '''velomobile''', '''velomobiel''', '''velo''', or '''bicycle car''' is a [[human-powered vehicle]] (HPV) enclosed for aerodynamic advantage and/or protection from weather and collisions.<ref>Frederik Van De Walle. ''[http://users.pandora.be/fietser/fotos/VM4SD-FVDWsm.pdf The Velomobile as a Vehicle for more Sustainable Transportation]'' {{ISSN|1651-0194}}, Retrieved on 23 November 2007.</ref> They are similar to [[recumbent bicycle]]s and [[tricycle]]s, but with a full [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]] (aerodynamic or weather protective shell). A fairing may be added to a non-faired cycle, or the fairing may be an integral part of the structure, [[monocoque]] like that of an airplane. The term velomobile can be thought of as similar in scope to the cycle (pedal vehicle) world as the term automobile is to the automotive world.\n\nThey are not to be confused with purpose-built for racing or speed records fully fared vehicles with two wheels, generally called [[streamliner]]s. Streamliners have set many speed and distance records.<ref>[http://ihpva.org/hpvarech.htm records]</ref> Though fast in their own right, velomobiles are considered much more streetable machines.  Using three or more wheels can have advantages for everyday use, including the ability to stop and start unaided, better stability, cross-wind handling, etc., though there are arguments made that the multiple track machines (three or more wheels) have aerodynamic disadvantages due to the drag of the extra wheels and the surface contact points.<ref>[https://www.sheldonbrown.com/rinard/aero/aerodynamics.htm A good discussion on bicycle wheel aerodynamics is here.]</ref>  In practice though, velomobiles continue to be close to their two-wheel cousins in performance.<ref>[https://lonniemorse.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/streamliners-and-velomobiles/ velomobiles continue to be close to their 2 wheel cousins in performance]</ref> \n\nThere are few velomobile manufacturers; some are home-built. Some models have the operator's head exposed; this has the advantage of giving the operator unobstructed vision, hearing, and some cooling, with the disadvantage of being potentially more exposed to weather and less aerodynamic. Fully enclosed machines can suffer from heat or humidity issues as well as potential noise issues. \n\nThe typical drive train<ref>[http://mccraw.co.uk/milan-velomobile-drivetrain-details/ typical drive train]</ref> of a velomobile is not unlike a bicycle or recumbent. It will consist of a front [[bottom bracket]] with one or more [[Crankset#Chainring|chainrings]], and a rear [[Derailleur gears|derailleur]].  Depending on the configuration of the velomobile there may be any number of idler pulleys, and chaintubes<ref>[http://www.ihpva.org/Projects/tstrike/building/plasticguide.htm chaintubes]</ref> along the drive train to manage and protect the chain. One of the defining characteristics of most velomobiles is that the [[Bicycle drivetrain systems|chain and drivetrain components]] are protected from weather and the road.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Fantom2sits.jpg|thumb|A two-seat open-top [[Fantom]]]]\n[[File:YellowPPV.jpeg|thumb|A two-seat [[People Powered Vehicle]]]]\n[[File:frontquarter.jpg|thumb|Cab-Bike]]\n[[File:Nzleitras.jpg|thumb|Leitras]]\n[[File:Waw020.jpg|thumb|Waw]]\n[[File:Vehicule faible consommation electrique.jpg|thumb|Leiba Xstream electric (eco marathon)]]\n[[File:Velomobile crosses Chambers jeh.jpg|thumb|In use in New York, 2018]]\nBefore World War I, Charles Mochet built a small four-wheeled 'bike'-car for his son. Mochet built many models of small vehicles called \"[[Velocar]]\". Some models had two seats, most were pedal powered, but as the years went by, many were fitted with small engines.<ref>[http://www.cyclegenius.com/history.php The Real History of the Recumbent Bicycle] Retrieved on 26 March 2008.</ref>  Mochet Velocars use a thin wood/plywood body on a steel frame.\n\nSome other early velomobiles use a fabric body or \"skin\" sewn to fit loosely on closely spaced wires or tubes, then painted or \"doped\" with a liquid that dries and shrinks the fabric to a tight fit on the wire/tube supports.  The approach was used widely on early [[airplanes]], and has the advantage of light weight with relatively low-technology materials.  It is sometimes called \"bird cage\" construction because the support looks similar to closely spaced wires used in construction of [[bird cage]]s, and because the wire/tube support outline shows through once the fabric is tight.  Some disadvantages of this approach are the cost of construction, due to the many interconnected supports; and that the shape is that of many flat panels, which limits smoothness of the skin and thus limits the aerodynamics.\n\nIn the 1970s, the [[People Powered Vehicle]] was produced. It was a two-seat, \"sociable\" tandem with a steel sub frame and molded plastic body. It was well designed and weighed something over {{convert|50|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}; a recently restored version weighs {{convert|59|kg|lbs|abbr=on|disp=or}}.  However, it had flaws in the execution that doomed it as a practical, everyday vehicle. Positive features, such as easily adjustable and comfortable seats, independent pedalling for both passenger and driver, adequate cargo space and relatively good weather protection, could not overcome the negative features, such as a complex, heavy and badly spaced three-speed gear box, ineffective brakes, and pedals that slid on sleeve bearings on steel shafts, which made it difficult to use as an everyday vehicle.\n\nIn [[Sweden]], a two-seat design called [[Fantom]] was sold as blueprints and became very popular; over 100,000 copies of the blueprints were sold, but few were actually completed.  The downfall of these early 'bicycle' cars came when the economy improved and people chose motorised transport.\n\n==Modern/contemporary velomobiles==\nBuilders continued to make \"one-off\" velomobiles, but for a time none were available commercially.  In the 1970s, [[Carl-Georg Rasmussen]]\nrediscovered ''Fantomen''; he redesigned it and in 1983 started selling a production version called [[Leitra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fyens.dk/indland/Ufo-med-pedalmotor/artikel/1323680|title=Ufo med pedalmotor|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>  Leitra velomobiles have been in continuous production since then (as of 2017), with current models evolved/improved from the originals.\n\nThere are many ways to build a velomobile.  One modern design is \"body-on-frame\", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body.  A standard cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with special fittings to mount the body; the use of special fittings tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight.  Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it does not need to be self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames.  Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used.  However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.\n\nAnother modern design is the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]], using aluminum sheet formed and riveted to make the fairing and the structure in one piece.  This approach is sometimes called [[monocoque]] or \"unit\" construction; it was used in airplanes before 1920 and has been used commonly in automobiles since the 1970s.  Labor costs to build an Alleweder are significant due to the many rivets and rivet holes.  Also, the choices of aerodynamic shapes are limited by the formability of the aluminum sheet.  That said, aluminum is relatively inexpensive, and as of 2017 Alleweders can be often be bought for less than other designs; they can also be bought as kits, to reduce out-of-pocket cost.  Aluminum can also be repaired relatively easily, and aluminum, which is homogeneous, can be recycled more easily than many composite materials.\n\nAnother common modern design is a monocoque shell, often made of [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] or \"FRP\", plus sub-frames of welded aluminum tubes.  FRP can be used to produce a wide range of shapes, and thus can improve aerodynamics over approaches such as \"birdcage\" and aluminum-sheet monocoque.  FRP can also use fibers with high strength-to-weight ratio that in velomobiles can save several kilograms compared to other designs.  A wide range of fibers may be used, but those which reduce weight while retaining strength and toughness often increase the price significantly\u2014e.g., a premium of 1000 Euros to save 3&nbsp;kg.  In addition, it is often hard to segregate and recycle the FRP materials.  But despite the cost and other issues, the aerodynamic and weight advantages mean that (as of 2017) monocoque FRP is a common way to build velomobiles.\n\nAs of 2017, most velomobiles are tricycles with two front wheels.  A tricycle has the advantage over a bicycle that it does not fall over when stopped.  In addition, when a cross-wind hits a fairing, it makes a big force; faired tricycles are less likely to get blown over than faired bicycles.  Although three wheels have practical advantages, they also have more aerodynamic drag than two wheels, so land speed record cycles are often bicycles.  Although four wheels were used as far back as the Velocar, they are not today common.  As of 2017, there is at least one 4-wheel production model, the [[QuattroVelo]].  Four wheels tends to further hurt aerodynamics and weight compared to three; but for a given width, four wheels is much more laterally stable than three wheels.  Also, four wheels can be placed in a way that increases luggage capacity a lot compared to three-wheel designs.\n\nMost velomobiles drive the rear wheel(s).  This approach is simple and can often use many standard bicycle parts.  Velomobiles with two rear wheels may drive just one wheel, or may drive both.  Driving a single wheel is the simplest and lightest approach.  Driving both wheels can improve traction but also increases complexity, cost, and weight.  A solid axle may be used, but increases friction/drag in corners and thus can slow down the vehicle.  One alternative is a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]], which is the approach used in most cars.  A second alternative is to use a pair of ratchets, where the slower wheel is driven and the faster wheel coasts.  Rear drive often uses \"idler\" pulleys to route the chain; front-wheel drive can eliminate idlers, so offers less friction and also less weight.  It can also increase luggage capacity.  However, front drive with two front wheels uses some non-standard components, and as of 2017 is used only rarely.\n\nAs with other cycles, a velomobile may use suspension.  Suspension tends to improve rider comfort, and can also improve speed\u2014it takes energy to \"bounce\" the velomobile and rider, so a suspension can reduce the energy lost to bouncing.  However, suspension adds cost, weight, and maintenance.  Common velomobile designs include no suspension, front-only suspension, and front+rear suspension.\n\nAs of 2017, there are several commercial makers of velomobiles.  At the same time, there are still many \"one-off\" makers.  Individual designs (both one-off and production) emphasize specific features.  For example, some emphasize aerodynamics and light weight to improve average speed, even if cost, ease of entry/exit, comfort, and other \"practical vehicle\" attributes are reduced.  By analogy, many automobile makers make performance cars with limited seating and cargo and worse emissions and fuel economy.  In contrast, other velomobile designs sacrifice performance features in order to improve cost, entry/exit, comfort, carrying capacity, and so on.  By analogy, many automobile makers offer cargo vans.  As of 2017, individual makers sometimes offer models spanning a range of features\u2014for example, there are Milan models used in racing but also a Milan \"cargo\" model with enough luggage volume to carry a (not-pedaling) human passenger and other bulky items.\n\nAll current (2017) velomobiles are produced in low volume, with \"big\" makers producing one or a few velomobiles per week.  Velomobiles use some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles, and thus made in low volume.  The use of \"more parts\" (e.g., 3 wheels instead of 2) and \"more low-volume\" parts makes velomobiles more expensive.  The only attempt at a mass-produced velomobile, which was in the mid-1980s, flopped.  This was the [[Sinclair C5]].  The C5 was a delta trike (one front, two rear wheels) with electric assist designed to be mass-produced and sold for a low price.  The C5 was poorly designed; it was heavy, had only one gear and had no adjustment for the distance between the pedals and the seat, which is important to get a comfortable pedalling position.\n\nA concept and a potential assessment concerning low-cost velomobiles for daily short trips as well as strategies for reaching a critical lot size for mass production was the subject of a research project called RegInnoMobil.<ref>[http://www.buschbacher.at/reginnomobilen.html Research project \"RegInnoMobil\" about low-cost velomobiles for short daily trips] Retrieved on 19 January 2010.</ref>\n\nVelomobiles have also been used in [[Australian HPV Super Series]] since 1985, and more recently, other events in Australia like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]], the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], and the [[Victorian HPV Series]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe Milan was used by [[Christian von Ascheberg]], current record holder in the 24 hours (1219&nbsp;km) and 1000&nbsp;km (19h27m) category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whpva.org/land.html#380|title=Records-Land - World Human Powered Vehicle Association|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whpva.org/land.html#390|title=Records-Land - World Human Powered Vehicle Association|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nin 2018 [https://www.facebook.com/dave.lewis.9803 Dave Lewis] set a new race record at the [http://www.bikesebring.org/raceresults.php Sebring 24 hour race] using a DF velomobile made by ''[https://www.intercitybike.nl/  Intercitybike.nl]''    Velomobiles also competed in the ultra endurance [http://photo-gallery-breaking-records-at-the-2018-trans-am-ultra-endurance-race/  Trans Am Bike race] and came in 1st (setting a new record) and 4th places.  1st place was [https://www.facebook.com/velonaut.swiss Marcel Graber]   and 4th [https://www.facebook.com/dave.lewis.9803 Dave Lewis] the full results can be found [https://transambikerace.com/results/  here - though at the time of this writing it is only current through 2017]\n\n== Comparison to other cycle types ==\nThe velomobile fairing adds weight compared to standard upright cycles or unfaired recumbent cycles.  For a given terrain, the added weight demands lower gearing and makes the velomobile slower climbing hills than its unfaired counterpart.\n\nSome velomobile fairings are mainly for weather protection.  However, if the velomobile fairing is substantially streamlined, then improved aerodynamics means the speeds on flats and down hills may be substantially higher than its unfaired counterpart, and often enough faster to make up for the slower climbing due to weight.\n\nAn aerodynamic fairing must be well-shaped, but minimizing the [[frontal area]] of the velomobile is also important to reduced drag: a fairing with half the frontal area may approach half the air drag.  In turn, aerodynamic velomobiles use a laid-back or [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbent]] riding position, with the rider's head much lower than on regular bicycles.  In turn, velomobile is much easier to accidentally \"hide\" behind a car or road-side shrubbery, fences, etc.\n\nVelomobile bodies are typically light enough that the center of mass is similar to the center of mass on an unfaired recumbent cycle.  This makes cornering stability similar to similar unfaired cycles.  However, minimizing velomobile width also contributes to reduced frontal area and thus drag; so there is an additional incentive to make the velomobile narrow.  The narrowest velomobiles are only slightly wider than the rider's shoulders, and so the width approaches that of an upright bicycle.  However, an upright bicycle still has a significantly narrower \"useful\" width, as the road contact is in the center and so the rider's hands/elbows/etc. might overhang the edge of the roadway or path without causing problems.  In contrast, the wheel track of a velomobile is very nearly as wide as the vehicle itself, and so cannot overhang the edge.\n\nAs of 2017, most velomobiles use a tadpole recumbent [[tricycle]] configuration \u2014 mainly to reduce component weight and improve wheel aerodynamics.  However, some use a four-wheel or [[quadracycle]] configuration.  The extra wheel significantly improves cornering stability and can also improve luggage capacity.  As of 2017 there are not many four-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings, but there are a few, and some riders report speeds are close to three-wheel velomobiles with highly aerodynamic fairings.\n\nTwo-wheel \"streamliner\" configurations can have much less aerodynamic drag: wheels are hard to make aerodynamic; each wheel entry/exit to the fairing adds drag; and velomobiles with two front wheels are necessarily wider or longer than the rider, while two-wheel streamliners can be barely wider than the rider.  A common way to describe aerodynamic drag is \"[[Frontal area|CdA]]\"; in one comparison of racing cycles, there were several two-wheel streamliners with less than half the CdA drag of the best three-wheeler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventuresofgreg.com/HPVlog/VehicleDrags.html|title=Vehicle Drags|author=Greg Kolodziejzyk|accessdate=30 July 2017}}</ref>  Air drag is most significant for high-speed events; as of 2016, the world record for a 200-metre sprint on near-level ground is about 145&nbsp;km/h for a two-wheel streamliner and about 120&nbsp;km/h for any vehicle with more than two wheels,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ihpva.org/hpvarecl.htm|title=IHPVA Official Speed Records|publisher=International Human Powered Vehicle Association|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref> meaning the two-wheel vehicle was about 20% faster.  Aerodynamic power is roughly cubic in speed, so at lower speeds the difference is much less pronounced.  At the same time, two-wheel streamliners require a way to stay upright when stopped and at very low speed, and are more sensitive to blowing over in cross-winds.  These factors limit the use of streamliners, despite their aerodynamic advantage.\n\nThe fairing on a velomobile sometimes makes it more subject to cross-winds than a similar unfaired cycle.  The effect of cross-winds is complicated because the force of the wind can act as a steering force, as-if the rider had tried to steer the cycle.  \"Wind steer\" can be a safety issue and may also hurt performance, as a serpentine path is longer and thus slower than a straight line.  Thus, a design with inferior aerodynamics may be better overall.  For example, it is common for [[Time trial bicycle|time-trial bicycle]]s to use a solid disk rear wheel for best aerodynamics, and a spoked front wheel that has worse aerodynamics than a disk, but is less likely to steer the bicycle in a cross-wind.  Velomobile fairings have analogous concerns, leading to trade-offs in fairing design.  For example, a longer \"tail\" on the fairing will increase the total side-wind profile and total side forces, but can reduce the percentage force acting on the steered wheels and so an improve stability in side winds.  A larger fairing also hurts weight and has more [[Skin friction drag|skin drag]]), but as with time-trial bicycles, worse aerodynamics but better handling is sometimes a good trade-off.\n\nVelomobiles with fairings that are mainly for weather protection can use a more upright seating position.  This tends to improve both the ability to see and be seen.  However, to retain stability against tipping (both cornering and cross-winds), the wheel track needs to be wider than a comparable velomobile with a low seating position.  In turn, this may make the velomobile quite a bit wider than a conventional cycle.\n\n\"Weather\" protection includes cold and wet, but also shading from sun.  Since the rider is doing work, it is typically desirable to have at least some cooling.  Many velomobiles have vents and ducts which allow cooling while keeping out water; and the ducts/vents may be closed or covered in cold weather so the rider can stay comfortable even without a secondary heat source.  In warm and hot weather, the fairing provides sun protection, but blocks the rider from cooling air, and so may be much warmer for a given level of effort.  In some situations, a rider's power output (for any type of cycle) is limited by body temperature, and the worse cooling of a velomobile can limit the rider's power output more than on an unfaired cycle.  With an aerodynamic fairing, the velomobile rider at reduced power output may still be faster than an unfaired cycle, due to the lower aerodynamic drag.\n\nVelomobiles for cargo use often have heavy frames to carry load, plus the weight of the cargo itself.  In turn, the weight of the fairing may be relatively less important.  Also, bulky loads often have poor aerodynamics, and so the quality of aerodynamics of the fairing is less important.  This may enable use of a fairing which in hot weather can be converted to a canopy.  A canopy provides no aerodynamic benefits, but improves cooling compared to a faired configuration, while also reducing sun exposure compared to riding without a canopy.  Thus, a \"high speed\" velomobile may benefit most from better aerodynamics, even when aerodynamics hurts rider cooling; while at the same time a \"high load\" velomobile may benefit most from improved cooling (to maximize power output) even if that hurts aerodynamics.\n\nThe steered wheels on a velomobile will hit the fairing if steered sharply enough.  Making the fairing wider can give space to steer the wheels more sharply, but has down-sides for aerodynamics and width.  Although sharp steering is not needed at speed, many aerodynamic velomobiles have a much worse [[turning circle]] than an equivalent unfaired cycle.  In contrast an unfaired cycle cannot have fairing interference, and so even with the same wheel and rider configuration can steer a much tighter circle.  Steering only the rear wheel(s) would avoid fairing interference, but it is hard to build a stable vehicle using only [[Steering#Rear wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]].  The [https://www.idmoove.com/de/ Velayo] uses a tricycle configuration and steers only the rear wheel; but it is produced only in small numbers. The experimental Kingsbury Fortuna and Quattro velomobiles [[Four-wheel steering|steered all wheels]]; this approach avoids some of the stability problems of rear-wheel steering while still reducing the steering angle of the front wheels.  However, this approach has not (as of 2017) gained wider use in velomobiles.\n\nA velomobile's fairing shields the drivetrain from weather, as well as the rider.  Drivetrain maintenance is often reduced compared to other cycles, especially unfaired bicycles, where the front wheel kicks up grit-containing dust, mud, and dirty water that lands directly on the chain and increases the rate of abrasive wear on the drivetrain\u2014including chain and sprockets, but sometimes also derailleurs.  The fairing of a velomobile tends to limit both the amount and the kinds of grit landing on the drivetrain.  Some cycles use tooth-belt drive, which is less affected by grit, is quieter than a chain, and may be lighter.  However, belts are only available in pre-selected sizes.  Many recumbent cycles, including most velomobiles, have a long drivetrain for which no suitable tooth belts are available.\n\nVelomobiles are significantly bulkier than conventional cycles.  Further, the bodywork typically cannot be disassembled much, whereas conventional cycles often can be disassembled to fit in a box or bag of dimensions similar to the frame.  In turn, this makes velomobiles more difficult to transport.\n\nVelomobiles are often built using some standard bicycle parts, but also many parts specific to velomobiles or even specific to a particular make or model.  In addition, the bodywork is large and may be around half the weight of a velomobile.  Thus, to reduce weight, the body is often made of lighter but more expensive materials.  Also, production volumes are low, so for both parts and labor there are not benefits of mass production\u2014as of 2017, many velomobile makers have yearly production on the order of tens or maybe a few hundred velomobiles.  Taken together, these factors mean velomobiles are often much more expensive than other cycle types.\n\nAs an example of prices and price/weight tradeoffs, as of April 2017 the maker Trisled offers their \"Rotovelo\" model either with a [[Rotational molding|rotational molded]] plastic fairing or with a carbon fiber fairing (as well as some other weight-saving changes).  The body shapes and underlying framework are similar; the rotational-molded version weighs 33 kilograms and has a list price of Au$6500,<ref>{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-2|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref> while the carbon fiber version weighs 20 kilograms and has a list price of Au$10900.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trisled Rotovelo Carbon|url=http://trisled.com.au/hpv/rotovelo-carbon|publisher=Trisled|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the cycle-related infrastructure design is based on the typical configuration of an upright bicycle.  For example, multi-modal transportation such as bike/train/bike routes often use bicycle racks in the train, and the dimensions of racks and also the train ingress/egress assume a conventional cycle.  Similarly, cycle paths often have bollards or S-bend paths to prevent motor vehicle entry, and the entry is often spaced for upright bicycles, but may be too narrow or require too sharp of a turn to allow through some velomobiles.\n\n== Electric assisted velomobiles ==\n{{Anchor|Hybrid velomobile}}\nSome velomobiles have been converted to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver's leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared hub motors (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive hub motors (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but mid-drive units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nWhile an electric-assist unit does add extra weight to the velomobile,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t17956-leiba-x-stream-electric-iut-aisne|title=velomobile electric leiba X stream  (IUT Aisne)|publisher=}}</ref> it is somewhat offset by the flexibility it also provides, especially during hill climbs and stop-and-go traffic. Due to vastly better aerodynamics of velomobiles the range of a similar electric assist unit and similar battery in a velomobile can be about 50% to 100% higher compared to upright bicycles or unfaired recumbents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn events like the [[RACV Energy Breakthrough]] and the [[Technology Challenge Maryborough|Fraser Coast Technology Challenge]], there are entire categories dedicated to electric and other hybrid powered velomobiles.\n\nThe legal definition of \"bicycle\" often includes velomobiles, but [[Electric bicycle laws|laws covering cycles with electric assist]] vary widely across countries and often within a country and even between cities in a region.  For example, a specific vehicle may be a \"bicycle\" in one area, a \"low-speed pedal-assisted cycle\" in another area, and a \"moped\" in yet a third.  Similarly, going from 3 wheels to 4 wheels can change the category of an otherwise identical vehicle.  One reason for the varying treatment is that many laws are older than widespread use of power-assisted velomobiles and so the laws were not written to consider such vehicles.  In some areas, laws are being rewritten to include power-assist velomobiles and to harmonize treatment with nearby laws.\n\n==DIY (do it yourself) velomobiles==\nWith a growing [[DIY]]-community{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and an increasing interest in environmentally friendly \"[[green energy]]\", some [[hobby]]ists have endeavored to build their own velomobiles from kits, sourced components, or from scratch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelwolf.com/essn/ESSN-Mar2005.pdf |title=ESSN-Mar2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-06-19}}</ref> When compared to similar sized commercial velomobiles, the DIY velomobiles tend to be less expensive.\n\nProbably the most built velomobile kits are the various models of the [[:de:Alleweder|Alleweder]] made from prefabricated aluminium sheet metal due to its affordable price. Some velomobile manufacturers offer their models as kits for self-assembly (R\u00e4derwerk Milan Mk2 + Milan SL, Beyss Go-One Evo K + Go-One Evo Ks, [http://www.alligt.nl/bodies/alleweder-a9.html Alleweder A9/Sunrider Mk2] for instance) at reduced price.\n\n==Velomobile and recumbent Internet communities==\nMany amateur velomobile builders are also recumbent bike riders.  In more recent years many online velomobile groups, some of them focusing on specific regions, have appeared, on Facebook and on other platforms.  Engaging actively in those communities is probably the best way to get informed and eventually own a velomobile.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Bicycle drum brake]]\n* [[Cycle rickshaw]]\n* [[Outline of cycling]]\n* [[Quadracycle]]\n* [[Victorian HPV Series|HPV Racing, Victoria Australia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.bentrideronline.com/messageboard/forumdisplay.php?f=15 Bent Rider Online Forums: Velomobiles]\n* [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/09/the-velomobile-high-tech-bike-or-low-tech-car.html Low Tech Magazine \u2013 The Velomobile: High tech bike or low tech car?]\n* [http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2012/10/electric-velomobiles.html Low Tech Magazine \u2013 Electric Velomobiles: as Fast and Comfortable as Automobiles, but 80 times more Efficient]\n* [http://velorizontal.bbfr.net/t17956-leiba-x-stream-electric-iut-aisne forum velomobile and bentrider]\n*[http://wood-velomobile.webnode.nl/links-/ Wood Velomobile]\n\n== Velomobile manufacturers ==\n*http://www.akkurad.com/velomobile.html (Alleweder)\n*http://www.flevelo.com (Orca)\n*http://www.go-one.de\n*https://www.intercitybike.nl/en (DF)\n*https://www.idmoove.com/de/ (Velayo, Messerschmitt)\n*http://www.katanga.eu (WAW)\n*http://www.leiba.de\n*http://www.drymershop.nl (Mango, Hilgo)\n*http://trisled.com.au (Rotovelo, Overzealous)\n*http://en.velomobiel.nl (Quattrovelo, Quest, Strada)\n*http://velomobil.eu (Milan)\n*http://velomobiel.ro (Alpha 7, Quest, Strada, Libelle)\n*http://www.velomobilize.at (Velayo)\n*https://velomtek.com (VX2)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Human-powered vehicles}}\n\n[[Category:Cycle types]]\n[[Category:Human-powered vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Millencolin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVelomobile manufacturers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velomobile"}

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S.

Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant.

The old Syrian period was dominated by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite first kingdom]] (3000 BC - 2300 BC), [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Kingdom of Nagar]] (2600 BC - 2300 BC) and the [[Mari, Syria#The second kingdom|Mariote second kingdom]] (2500 BC - 2290 BC). The [[Akkadian Empire]] conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000\u20131600&nbsp;BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]]. The Amorites also founded [[Babylon]] in Mesopotamia. Also following the Akkadians was the extension of Khirbet Kerak ware culture, showing affinities with the [[Caucasus]], and possibly linked to the later appearance of the [[Hurrians]].\n\nAround the 17th and 16th centuries&nbsp;BC most of the older centers had been overrun. The [[Mitanni]], for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were defeated by it around the middle of the 14th. The Semitic [[Hyksos]] used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to develop in their wake. From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which in the latter half of this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century&nbsp;BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Cities all around the eastern Mediterranean were sacked within a span of a few decades by assorted raiders. The Hittite empire was destroyed. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened. Multiple cities on the Coast like [[Ugarit]] and other Canaanite cities were destroyed by the Sea People.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse|destruction at the end of the Bronze Age]] left a number of tiny kingdoms and city-states behind. A few [[Hittites|Hittite]] centres remained in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] known as the [[Syro-Hittite states]], along with some [[Phoenicia]]n ports in [[Canaan]] that escaped destruction and developed into great commercial powers. The [[Israelites]] emerged as a rural culture (possibly from the displaced Canaanite refugees escaping the Bronze Age Collapse to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] alongside groups like the [[Shasu]] and the [[Habiru]]) mainly in the Canaanite hill-country and the Eastern Galilee, quickly spreading through the land and forming an alliance in the struggle for the land against the Philistines to the West, [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]] to the East and [[Edom]] to the South. In the 12th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, most of the interior, as well as [[Babylonia]], was overrun by [[Aramaeans|Arameans]], while the shoreline around today's [[Gaza Strip]] was settled by [[Philistines]]. At this time the Chaldeans (in different waves of people) had left the Levant for Mesopotamia and established the [[Neo-Babylonian empire]] from which [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] came from. \n\nIn this period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the [[Phoenician alphabet]], developed by the Phoenicians or the Canaanites around the 16th century&nbsp;BC.\n\nDuring the 9th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] began to reassert themselves against the incursions of the Aramaeans, and over the next few centuries developed into a powerful and well-organised empire. Their armies were among the first to employ cavalry, which took the place of chariots, and had a reputation for both prowess and brutality. At their height, the Assyrians dominated all of the Levant, Egypt, and Babylonia. However, the empire began to collapse toward the end of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, and was obliterated by an alliance between a resurgent [[New Kingdom of Babylonia]] and the Iranian [[Medes]].\n\nThe subsequent balance of power was short-lived, though. In the 550s&nbsp;BC the [[Persian people|Persians]] revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed to it the realms of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]], [[Damascus]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Egypt]], as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as [[India]]. This vast kingdom was divided up into various [[satrap]]ies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time [[Zoroastrianism]] became the predominant religion in [[Iran|Persia]].\n\n==Classical Age==\n[[Iran|Persia]] controlled the Levant, but by the 4th century&nbsp;BC Persia had fallen into decline. The Phoenicians on the coast started many unsuccessful rebellions against the Persians who taxed them a lot, while the Jews were more relaxed under the Persian rule especially after the return from the exile that Cyrus the Great granted them. [[Ten Thousand|The campaigns]] of [[Xenophon]] in 401-399 BC illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to armies organized along [[ancient Greece|Greek]] lines. Such an army under the Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Levant (333-332 BC).\n\nAlexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm; after his death in 323 BC the greater share of the east eventually went to [[Seleucid Empire|the descendants]] of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. This period saw great innovations in mathematics, science, architecture, and the like, and Greeks founded cities throughout the east, some of which grew to be the world's first major metropolises.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} [[Hellenistic culture]] did not, however, reach very far into the countryside. The Seleucids brought lots of Greeks, in addition to the descendants of the soldiers who served in the army of Alexander, from Greek cities to populate new cities founded all over the Levant.\n\nThe [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] (312 to 63 BC) adopted a pro-western stance that alienated both the powerful eastern satraps and many Greeks who had migrated to the east. During the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Greek culture lost ground in the Levant, and the Seleucid Empire began to break apart. The Seleucid decline continued, and the [[Roman Republic]] overran the Seleucid heartland in 65&nbsp;BC. Judea, which [[Maccabean Revolt|had become independent]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] (140 BC - 37 BC), was annexed by Rome in 63&nbsp;BC and became [[Iudaea Province]] (6 - 135 AD), the period became notable for when the Jewish population was expelled from Jerusalem after the destruction of the second Temple c. 70 AD and dispersed all over the old world. Five Roman legions were placed in the Levant proper for a couple of centuries until they eventually fade from historical records in the start of the 5th century. \n\nA Persian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] (224-651), periodically clashed with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and later with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 391 the Byzantine era began with the permanent division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves. Byzantine control over many parts of the Levant lasted until 636, when [[Arabs|Arab]] armies [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered the area]] and it became a part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]].\n\nThe [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] reached a low point under [[Phocas]] ([[Byzantine Emperor]] from 602 to 610), with the Sassanids occupying the whole of the eastern Mediterranean. In 610, though, [[Heraclius]] took the throne in [[Constantinople]] and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the [[Persian people|Persians]] and invading [[Medes|Media]] and [[Assyria]]. Unable to stop his advance, the Sassanian king [[Khosrau II]] was assassinated (628) and the Sassanid empire fell into anarchy. Weakened by their quarrels, neither the Byzantines nor the Sassanids could deal with the onslaught of the [[Arabs]], newly unified under the banners of [[Islam]] and keen to expand their area of control. By 650 [[Early Muslim conquests|Arab forces had conquered]] all of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], and [[Upper Egypt|Egypt]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Near East]]\n* [[History of the Northern Levant]]\n** [[History of Cyprus]]\n* [[History of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of Israel]] \n** [[History of Palestine (region)]]\n** [[History of the Southeastern Levant]]\n** [[Pre-history of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n** [[History of the Sinai Peninsula]]\n*[[History of Islam]]\n*[[History of the Middle East]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Philip Mansel, ''Levant: Splendour and Catastrophe on the Mediterranean'', London, John Murray, 11 November 2010, hardback, 480 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6707-0}}, New Haven, Yale University Press, 24 May 2011, hardback, 470 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-300-17264-5}}\n\n{{Commons category|History of the Levant}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Levant.html The History of the Ancient Near East]\n\n{{Ancient states and regions of the Levant}}\n{{Prehistoric Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Levant}}\n[[Category:Ancient Levant| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|History of the [[Levant]]|what the area is called by natives and others|Names of the Levant|region's history|History of the Middle East}}\n{{Short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2015}}\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Levant - Satellite.png|thumb|300x300px|The Levant]] -->\nThe [[Levant]] is the large area in [[Southwest Asia]], south of the [[Taurus Mountains]], bounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, the [[Arabian Desert]] in the south, and [[Mesopotamia]] in the east.

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic languages]] in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|url-status=live|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at [[Tell es-Sultan]] (ancient Jericho) (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant.

The earliest Muslim copper coins are anonymous and undated but a series exists which may have been issued during the Caliphates of Uthman or [[Ali]].

A scattering of patterned pieces in silver exist from this date, based on Sassanian prototypes but with distinctive Arabic reverses. This experiment, which maintained the Sassanian weight standard of 3.5\u20134.0 grams was not proceeded with, and in AH&nbsp;79 (698&nbsp;CE) a completely new type of silver coin was struck at 14 mints to a new nominal weight of 2.97 grams. Unlike the contemporary gold coinage, this figure does not seem to have been achieved in practice. The average weight of sixty undamaged specimens of AH&nbsp;79\u201384 is only 2.71 grams, a figure very close to that for a unique coin of AH&nbsp;79 struck with no mint name (as was the standard procedure for the gold dinars produced in Damascus). These new coins which bore the name of 'dirham', established the style of the Arab-Sassanian predecessors at 25 to 28&nbsp;mm in diameter. Their design is composed of Arabic inscriptions surrounded by circles and annulets. \n\nOn each side there is a three- or four-line legend with a single circular inscription. Outside this are three line circles with, at first, five annulets surrounding them. The side normally taken as the obverse has as its central legend the Kalima or shahada: \"There is no god except Allah alone, there is no partner with Him.\" Around it is the mint and date formula reading \"In the Name of Allah: this Dirham was struck in [mint name e.g. Damascus] the year [e.g. AH&nbsp;79]\". The reverse has a four line central inscription taken from the Surah 112 of the Quran; \"Qul hu Allahu Ahad, Allahu-Samad, Lam yalid wa lam yulad wa lam yakul-lahu kufu-an ahad\"'. The marginal legend states: \"Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, he was sent with guidance and the religion of truth to make it prevail over every other religion, averse though the idolaters may be\" (Quran 9:33)\n\n==First gold dinar==\n\nThe gold coins were first struck to the contemporary standard of 4.4 grams and with one or more Arabic Standing figures on the obverse and an Arabic legend on the reverse. Dated coins exist from AH&nbsp;74 and are named as 'Dinars'. These experimental issues were replaced in AH&nbsp;77, except in North Africa and Spain, by completely epigraphical designs very similar to the designs adopted for the silver pieces but with a shorter reverse legend and no annulets or inner circles. This type was used without appreciable change for the whole of [[Umayyad]] period, the coins being struck to a new and carefully controlled standard of 4.25 grams. This weight was reputed to be based on the average of the current [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine solidi]], was called a [[Mithqal]], a term used earlier for {{frac|72}} of a ratl. Evidence of the importance attached to the close control of the new Dinars is provided by the existence of glass weights, mainly from Egypt. They usually show the governor's name, sometimes the date but all marked with coin denomination.<ref>Broome, Michael. \"A Handbook of Islamic Coins.\" (Page 11)</ref>\n\nThe issues in gold from North Africa began as copies of the coins of Heraclius and his son (but with an abbreviated Kalima in Latin), the reverse \"cross on steps\" losing in most cases its cross piece. Dinars, halves and thirds were struck, all to the new weight standard. Later coins are dated by [[indiction]], from Indiction II (AH&nbsp;84\u201385) changing to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] date in Roman numerals in AH&nbsp;94 with Arabic phrases appearing in the field from AH&nbsp;97. In AH&nbsp;100, North Africa came into line with the eastern issues although the mint is named as [[Ifriqiya]]. The legends are shorter and the reverse has a new central inscription: \"In the Name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate\". This was used also on the coins from [[Al-Andalus]], and on the half and third Dinars, most of which show no mint but may well have been struck in Al-Andalus.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main|Modern gold dinar}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics}}\n*[[Fals]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{cite book\n|last = Porteous\n|first = John\n|year = 1969\n|title = Coins in History: A Survey of Coinage from the Reform of Diocletian to the Latin Monetary Union.\n|chapter = The Imperial Foundations\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/coinsinhistorysu00port/page/14 14\u201333]\n|publisher = Weidenfeld and Nicolson\n|isbn = 0-297-17854-7\n|url-access = registration\n|url = https://archive.org/details/coinsinhistorysu00port/page/14\n}}\n\n==External links==\nAdam Abdullah, (2020, Apr.), \"The Islamic Monetary Standard: The Dinar and Dirham\", ''International Journal of Islamic Economics and Finance Studies'', (6)1, pp.1-29\n\n{{Commonscat}}\n\n{{Dinar}}\n{{Islamic banking and finance}}\n[[Category:Gold coins|Dinar]]\n[[Category:Islamic banking]]\n[[Category:Economy of the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:Medieval currencies]]\n[[Category:Islamic banking and finance terminology]]\n[[Category:7th-century establishments in the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[id:Dinar emas]]\n[[sq:Dinari islam]]\n[[vi:Dinar v\u00e0ng]]\n", "text_old": "{{disputed|date=January 2020}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Dinar of Abd al-Malik, AH 75.jpg|thumb|Gold dinar of [[Umayyad Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] minted at [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in [[Hijri year|AH]]&nbsp;79 (697\u2013698&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]) having a weight of 4.25 grams]]\n[[File:Dinar of Ar-Radi.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Gold Dinar of the 20th Abbasid [[Caliph]] [[Ar-Radi]] bi'llah (934 to 940 CE)]]\n[[File:Fatimid dinar - al-Moez li-dini Allah.jpg|thumb|Dinar issued during the reign of the [[Fatimid]] emir [[Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah]] in [[Mansouria, Tunisia|Mansuriyah]] in 344 AH (955 AD)]]\n[[File:Dinar of Baybars.jpg|thumb|Dinar of the Mamluq sultan [[Baybars]] (658\u2013676 AH = 1260\u20131277 AD)]]\nThe '''gold dinar''' ({{lang-ar|\ufea9\ufef3\ufee8\ufe8e\ufead \u0630\u0647\u0628\u064a}}) is an Islamic medieval gold coin first issued in [[Islamic calendar|AH]]&nbsp;77 (696\u2013697&nbsp;CE) by [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]].
