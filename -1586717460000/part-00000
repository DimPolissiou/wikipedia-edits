It is one of the few musical instruments that still uses watch-key or [[Preston tuners]]. It is iconically associated with the musical genre known as [[Fado]], and is now an icon for anything Portuguese.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Port-guitar-silva-1796.jpg|thumb|Portuguese guitar]]\nThe Portuguese guitar now known has undergone considerable technical modification in the last century (dimensions, mechanical tuning system, etc.) although it has kept the same number of courses, the string tuning and the finger technique characteristic of this type of instrument.\n\nIt is a descendant of the [[Medieval]] [[citole]], based on evidence of its use in Portugal since the thirteenth century (then known as 'c\u00edtole' in Portuguese) amongst [[troubadour]] and minstrel circles and in the [[Renaissance]] period, although initially it was restricted to noblemen in court circles. Later it became popular and references have been found to [[citterns]] being played in the theater, in taverns and barbershops in the seventeenth and eighteenth century in particular.\n\nIn 1582, Friar Phillipe de Caverell visited Lisbon and described its customs; he mentions the Portuguese people\u2019s love for the [[cittern]] and other musical instruments. In 1649 was published the catalogue of the Royal Music Library of [[King John IV of Portugal]] containing the best known books of cittern music from foreign composers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which the complexity and technical difficulty of the pieces allow us to believe that there had been highly skilled players in Portugal.\n[[File:Jose malhoa fado.jpg|thumb|''Fado'', by [[Jos\u00e9 Malhoa]] (1910)]]\nThe angel playing the cittern (c.1680), a sculpture of large dimensions in the [[Alcoba\u00e7a Monastery]], depicts in detail the direct ancestor of the Portuguese guitar. In the first half of the eighteenth century, [[Ant\u00f3nio Nunes Ribeiro Sanches|Ribeiro Sanches]] (1699\u20131783) had cittern lessons in the town of [[Guarda, Portugal]], as he mentions in a letter from [[St. Petersburg]] in 1735.\n\nIn the same period there are other evidence to the use of the cittern alluding to a repertoire of sonatas, minuets, etc. shared with other instruments such as the harpsichord or the guitar.\nLater in the century (c. 1750), the so-called [[English guitar|English guittar]] made its appearance in Portugal. By 1786 those made by Simpson, an English luthier, became highly popular, and it was noted that he could also provide reliable nickel-silver strings. There was a type of cittern locally modified by German, English, Scottish and Dutch makers and enthusiastically greeted by the new mercantile bourgeoisie of the city of [[Porto]] who used it in the domestic context of [[Hausmusik]] practice. This consisted of the \"languid Modinhas\", the \"lingering Minuets\" and the \"risqu\u00e9 Lunduns\", as they were then called.<ref>See [http://imslp.org/wiki/Estudo_de_guitarra_%28Leite,_Ant%C3%B3nio_da_Silva%29 ''Estudo de Guitarra (...)''] by Ant\u00f3nio da Silva Leite (1759-1833) published in Oporto in 1796.</ref> The use of this type of guitar never became widespread.

F\u00e8tis' book ''The Music Made Easy''. The Portuguese translation includes a glossary describing the various characteristics (tunings, social status, repertoire, etc.) of both cittern and \"English\" guitar of the time.\n\nGradually the Simpson design was transformed by Portuguese luthiers, with a wider body, longer scale length, and a wider fingerboard, made more manageable by using a large radius, rather than a flat fingerboard.\n\nThe Portuguese guitar is used for solo music (''guitarradas'') as well as the accompaniment, which it shares with a steel strung classical guitar (''viola de fado'') and occasional double bass or guitar-bass,  and its wide repertoire is often presented in concert halls and in the context of classical and world music festivals all around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/6020994|title=The Portuguese Guitar: History and Transformation of an Instrument Associated with Fado|first=Nuno|last=Cristo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nThere are two distinct Portuguese guitar models: the [[Lisbon|Lisboa]] and the [[Coimbra]].\n\nThe differences between the two models are the scale length (445&nbsp;mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470&nbsp;mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament (''caracois -'' snail) that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped (''lagrima'') motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.\n\nAs early as 1905 [[luthiers]] were building larger Portuguese guitars (called ''guitarr\u00e3o'', the plural being ''guitarr\u00f5es''), seemingly in very small numbers and with limited success. Recently, the famed luthier Gilberto Gr\u00e1cio has built a ''guitarr\u00e3o'', which he named a ''[[guitol\u00e3o]]'' instead; this instrument which allows for a wider timbric range, on the low and the high end, than a regular Portuguese guitar.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/PortugueseGuitarMethod.html|title=Portuguese Guitar Method|website=www.fernandezmusic.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technique==\nThe techniques employed to play the Portuguese guitar are what are historically called ''figueta'' and ''dedilho''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fernandezmusic.com/Portuguesemethodpage2.html|title=Portuguesemethodpage2|website=www.fernandezmusic.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> ''Figueta'' technique comprises playing solely with the thumb and the index fingers and it was inspired by the technique used to play [[Viola_da_terra|Viola da Terra]].  ''Dedilho'' technique concentrates on up and down strokes of the index finger to play complex passages.  On the Portuguese guitar the strings are picked with the corner of the fingernails, avoiding contact of the flesh with the strings. The unused fingers of the picking hand rest below the strings, on the ''guarda-unhas'' on the soundboard. Most players use various materials in place of natural fingernails; these fingerpicks (''unhas'') were traditionally made of tortoiseshell, but today are usually nylon or plastic.  While Lisbon ''unhas'' are commonly rectangular shaped for a clearer attack, Coimbra ''unhas'' tend to follow the natural curve of the fingernail.\n\nTechnique basics are the ''fado maior, fado menor'' and ''fado Mouraria''. Then one masters the ''trinado'' (a triplet ornament), slides, picking individual strings (instead of both in a course), and intense characteristic vibrato to embellish the melody. Finally, in addition to the ''fados'', there are traditional virtuosic pieces\u2014the ''fado Lopes'', and ''Varia\u00e7oes'' em ''Re Menor'', ''La Menor'', ''Mi Menor'' and ''Si Menor.''\n\nA good ''guitarrista'' should know at least a hundred of the over two hundred standard ''fados''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Antonio|first=Parreira|title=O livro dos fados -- 180 Fados Tradicionais em partituras|publisher=Museu de Fado|year=2014|isbn=978-989-96629-9-5|location=Lisbon|pages=}}</ref> in any key requested by the ''fadista''.\n\n=== Lisboa ===\nThe Lisboa style of playing traditionally utilizes the Guitarra de Lisboa, but today it is increasingly more common to see musicians with Guitarra de Coimbra tuned tighter to accommodate the Lisboa tuning.<ref name=\":0\" />  In accompanying Lisbon Fado the ''guitarrista'' plays the introduction, traditionally based on the second half of the vocal melody, then alternates between the techniques described above and short expressive phrases answering the ''fadista's'' phrases in a musical call-and-response. In faster ''fados'' the ''guitarra'' often improvises virtuosically throughout, including soloing over the ''fadista's'' singing.\n\n=== Coimbra ===\nThe Coimbra style of playing, popularized by [[Artur Paredes|Artur]] and [[Carlos Paredes]], originates with the university students from the historic [[University of Coimbra|Universidade de Coimbra]].  The male students and graduates would traditionally play a [[Coimbra Fado]] at night or ''serenata'' (serenade) for a woman to be courted.\n\nInstead of bridging the gap between a singer's phrases, in Coimbra Fado, the ''guitarra'' plays the chordal accompaniment alongside the Acoustic guitar.  As opposed to the rapid, more technically challenging Lisbon Fado, the ''guitarrista'' plays a downstroke with the thumb followed by a rolled chord across all the strings which ends with the index finger crossed in front of the thumb.  This pattern is easily modified to fit the time signature of the specific Coimbra Fado being played.\n\n==Notable artists==\n[[File:Antonio Chainho.jpg|thumb|200px|Ant\u00f3nio Chainho and his Portuguese guitar (Lisbon model)]]\n\n[[Armandinho (fado guitarist)|Armandinho]], born in 1891, became one of the most influential guitar players in Lisbon, leaving a vast repertoire of variations and ''fados'' behind. Following in his footsteps came other guitarists, such as [[Jaime Santos]], Raul Nery, Jos\u00e9 Nunes, Carlos Gon\u00e7alves and [[Fontes Rocha]]. [[Artur Paredes]], born in 1899, was an equally important player in the city of Coimbra.  Many of today's Coimbra guitar features can be traced back to his contact with local luthiers.  His son [[Carlos Paredes]] was a virtuoso and attained great popularity, becoming the most internationally known Portuguese guitar player.  His compositions on the Portuguese guitar go beyond the traditional use of the instrument in ''fado'' musicianship giving him (and the instrument) a status above folk or regional music. This soloistic tradition has been followed till today by several outstanding musicians such as Pedro Caldeira Cabral, Antonio Chainho, Ricardo Rocha, Paulo Soares, and several other virtuoso guitarists of the younger generation. The first concerto for Portuguese guitar and orchestra in history was composed and premiered by Pedro Henriques da Silva on December 5th, 2017 with the Orchestra of the Swan at Stratford ArtsHouse in Stratford-upon-Avon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planethugill.com/2017/12/concerto-first-pedro-da-silva-oots.html|title=Concerto first: Pedro Da Silva & OOTS premiere work for Portuguese guitar|website=www.planethugill.com}}</ref>.\n\nMany leading ''guitarristas'' in Lisboa\u2014Mario Pacheco, Luis Guerreiro, Jose Manuel Neto, Henrique Leit\u00e3o, Bruno Chaveiro, Paulo de Castro, Ricardo Martins and Custodio Castelo - now use Oscar Cardoso ''guitarras'', which feature the extraordinary innovation of a cutaway in the back of the ''guitarra'', and a Coimbra string length but with Lisboa tuning. The virtuosity of these artists has changed the sound of ''fado'' radically, and their speed is extraordinary. Rocha has composed highly avant-garde pieces, and the original ''guitarradas'' of Pacheco, Castelo and Martins have become common repertoire in Lisboa, as those of Soares have become in Coimbra. Most advanced players will learn some of Carlos Paredes' difficult works. Marta Pereira Da Costa has achieved prominence as the first female virtuoso ''guitarrista.''\n\n===Outside Portuguese music===\nThe Portuguese guitar played a small role in Celtic and western folk music following the folk revival. In the 1970s, [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] of the band [[Planxty]] played a modified Portuguese guitar.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Magnussen|first1=Paul|title=Liam O'Flynn & Andy Irvine in conversation with Paul Magnussen|url=http://www.andyirvine.com/disc/interview.html|publisher=Guitar International (unpublished), 1982|accessdate=22 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172212/http://www.andyirvine.com/disc/interview.html|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref> British luthier Stefan Sobell based his early 1970s creation of the [[Cittern#Modern citterns|modern cittern]] on a Portuguese guitar he'd bought at a used shop in Leeds some years previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sobellguitars.com/how-i-started-my-first-cittern/|title=Stefan Sobell Guitars \u00bb How I started: my first cittern|website=www.sobellguitars.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Frets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E_aAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=GPI Publications}}</ref>\n\nSeveral jazz musicians have also recorded with the Portuguese guitar, including [[Brad Shepik]].<ref name=\"BogdanovWoodstra2002\">{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Bogdanov|author2=Chris Woodstra|author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=All Music Guide to Jazz: The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yXVEjS-j8IC&pg=PT971|year=2002|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0-87930-717-2|pages=971\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Inc.1998\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2Q4EAAAAMBAJ|date=21 March 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2Q4EAAAAMBAJ/page/n96 97]\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese guitar features prominently on [[Sun Kil Moon]]'s debut album ''[[Ghosts Of The Great Highway]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectrumculture.com/2014/02/11/sun-kil-moon-benji/|title=Sun Kil Moon: Benji - Album Review|date=11 February 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBritish guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] plays the instrument on the [[Yes (band)|Yes]] songs \"[[I've Seen All Good People]]\" from ''[[The Yes Album]]'' (1971), \"[[Wonderous Stories]]\" from ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977), also on \"Hour of Need\" from ''[[Fly from Here]]'' (2011) and finally on ''To Ascend'' from ''[[Heaven & Earth (Yes album)|Heaven and Earth]]'' (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2013/01/31/steve-howe-a-roundabout-way-to-yes?2|title=Steve Howe: A Roundabout Way to Yes|publisher=JamBands.com|first=Randy|last=Ray|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Portuguese guitar makers==\nThere are many Portuguese guitar makers still building guitars, according to traditional craftsmanship. Many families have passed on their knowledge for generations.\nAmongst the most notable ''guitarreiros'', or guitar makers, are the [[Gr\u00e1cio]] family, \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, the Tavares family (now living in Toronto Canada), the Cardoso family\u2014particularly Oscar Cardoso (whose guitarras are the subject of a recent book), Ant\u00f3nio Guerra, Domingos Machado, Fernando Meireles, Antonio Monteiro and Domingos Cerqueira. The Gr\u00e1cio family and \u00c1lvaro Ferreira's instruments are usually considered as the pinnacle in terms of quality, although these instruments are very hard to find and can be quite expensive. \n\nAntonio Pinto de Carvalho's APC luthiery is one of the largest in Europe, and produces thousands of traditional Portuguese stringed instruments. \n\n==Tuning==\n[[File:LisboaTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa (Lisboa tuning)]]\n[[File:CoimbraTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra (Coimbra tuning)]]\n[[File:NaturalTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural (Natural tuning)]]\n\nThe tuning chiefly employed on the Portuguese guitar was historically called ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado'' or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado corrido''. It was probably developed in the early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's ''fadistas'' by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa'', when tuned high, in D, or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra'', when tuned low, in C; this stems from the fact that while most Lisbon Fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a ''do/''C is called ''re/''D, a D is called ''mi/''E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a [[transposing instrument]] similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a whole step higher than the note name that [[Concert pitch|concert-pitch]] conventions would use).\n\nThe natural tuning, inherited from the [[English guitar|English guittar]] of the 18th century, was also very frequently employed up to the first half of the 20th century, being preferred to the former by some late-19th-century players; it was frequently tuned in E instead of C, as this simplified the change between the ''fado'' tuning for players who used both. Some variations of this tuning were also adopted, such as the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural com 4\u00aa'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o da Mouraria'', or the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Jo\u00e3o de Deus'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural menor''. The natural tuning and its variations have been for the most part, out of practice for several decades.\n\n== Notation ==\nThe Portuguese guitar can read Portuguese guitar tablature, sheet music in treble, or a combination of both.  The ''dedilho'' technique is notated with up and down arrows over multiple notes corresponding to a downstroke or upstroke of the index finger.  An \"i\" is used to indicate a stroke with the index finger, or ''indicador'', and a \"p\" is used for the thumb, or ''pulgar''.  The middle finger is rarely used but notated with an \"m\" for ''m\u00e9dio''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soares|first=Paulo|title=M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa|publisher=Paulo Soares|year=1997|isbn=|location=Coimbra|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile one can find many virtuosic Coimbra pieces written out as sheet music, ''fados'' are generally improvised and require no music for a good ''guitarrista'' to play.  The chord progression to each specific ''fado'' should be understood by the good ''guitarrista''.  While this skill has traditionally been acquired by younger players playing alongside a more advanced ''guitarrista'' in an ensemble, it was only in the early 2000s that the first ''fado'' school had been established to formally teach the improvisational style alongside the written version.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|last=Anaia Cristo|first=Nuno Jos\u00e9 dos Santos|date=January 2014|title=THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR: HISTORY AND TRANSFORMATION OF AN INSTRUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FADO|url=yorkspace.library.yorku.ca|journal=A Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | title = A Guitarra Portuguesa\n | first = Pedro\n | last = Caldeira Cabral\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Ediclube\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-719-077-4\n}} &mdash; THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR\n* {{cite book\n | title = The Portuguese Guitar Chord Bible: Lisboa Tuning 1,728 Chords\n | first = Tobe A.\n | last = Richards\n | location = United Kingdom\n | publisher = Cabot Books\n | year = 2009\n | isbn = 978-1-906207-13-7\n}} &mdash; A comprehensive chord dictionary for the Portuguese Lisboa Guitar\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa Vol. 1: Bases para a Guitarra de Coimbra\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-97496-0-4\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa, Vol. 2: Dom\u00ednio dos Acordes\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-972-97496-1-2\n}} &mdash; Chord building {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Guitarra Magica Fado\n | first = Eurico Augusto\n | last = Cebolo\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Unknown\n | isbn = 972-8019-07-6\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandolim]]\n*[[Viola braguesa]]\n*[[Rabeca]]\n*[[Gaita transmontana]]\n*[[Cavaquinho]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926110703/http://www.musinaction.pt/media/site_docs/pdf_67_16928_PGAcoustics_-_Part_1.pdf Acoustic analysis of Portuguese guitars] <sup>(Retrieved on 24-09-2013)</sup>\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.vu.carlosfernandes.guitarraportuguesa Portuguese Guitar for Android]\n{{Guitars}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portuguese Guitar}}\n[[Category:Fado]]\n[[Category:Guitars]]\n[[Category:Portuguese musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Necked box lutes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox instrument\n|name=Portuguese Guitar<br/>''Guitarra Portuguesa''\n|names=\n|image=2 Portuguese guitars.jpg\n|image_capt=Left: Coimbra guitar; right: Lisbon guitar\n|background=string\n|classification=[[String instrument]] \n|hornbostel_sachs=\n|hornbostel_sachs_desc=\n|range= \n|related= [[Guitar]] - [[Cittern]]\n|articles=\n}}\n\nThe '''Portuguese guitar''' or '''Portuguese guitarra''' ({{lang-pt|'''guitarra portuguesa'''}}, {{IPA-pt|\u0261i\u02c8ta\u0281\u0250 pu\u027etu\u02c8\u0263ez\u0250|pron}}) is a plucked string instrument with twelve steel strings, strung in six [[course (music)|courses]] of two strings.

While Lisbon ''unhas'' are commonly rectangular shaped for a clearer attack, Coimbra ''unhas'' tend to follow the natural curve of the fingernail.\n\nTechnique basics are the ''fado maior, fado menor'' and ''fado Mouraria''. Then one masters the ''trinado'' (a triplet ornament), slides, picking individual strings (instead of both in a course), and intense characteristic vibrato to embellish the melody. Finally, in addition to the ''fados'', there are traditional virtuosic pieces\u2014the ''fado Lopes'', and ''Varia\u00e7oes'' em ''Re Menor'', ''La Menor'', ''Mi Menor'' and ''Si Menor.''\n\nA good ''guitarrista'' should know at least a hundred of the over two hundred standard ''fados''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Antonio|first=Parreira|title=O livro dos fados -- 180 Fados Tradicionais em partituras|publisher=Museu de Fado|year=2014|isbn=978-989-96629-9-5|location=Lisbon|pages=}}</ref> in any key requested by the ''fadista''.\n\n=== Lisboa ===\nThe Lisboa style of playing traditionally utilizes the Guitarra de Lisboa, but today it is increasingly more common to see musicians with Guitarra de Coimbra tuned tighter to accommodate the Lisboa tuning.<ref name=\":0\" />  In accompanying Lisbon Fado the ''guitarrista'' plays the introduction, traditionally based on the second half of the vocal melody, then alternates between the techniques described above and short expressive phrases answering the ''fadista's'' phrases in a musical call-and-response. In faster ''fados'' the ''guitarra'' often improvises virtuosically throughout, including soloing over the ''fadista's'' singing.\n\n=== Coimbra ===\nThe Coimbra style of playing, popularized by [[Artur Paredes|Artur]] and [[Carlos Paredes]], originates with the university students from the historic [[University of Coimbra|Universidade de Coimbra]].  The male students and graduates would traditionally play a [[Coimbra Fado]] at night or ''serenata'' (serenade) for a woman to be courted.\n\nInstead of bridging the gap between a singer's phrases, in Coimbra Fado, the ''guitarra'' plays the chordal accompaniment alongside the Acoustic guitar.  As opposed to the rapid, more technically challenging Lisbon Fado, the ''guitarrista'' plays a downstroke with the thumb followed by a rolled chord across all the strings which ends with the index finger crossed in front of the thumb.  This pattern is easily modified to fit the time signature of the specific Coimbra Fado being played.\n\n==Notable artists==\n[[File:Antonio Chainho.jpg|thumb|200px|Ant\u00f3nio Chainho and his Portuguese guitar (Lisbon model)]]\n\n[[Armandinho (fado guitarist)|Armandinho]], born in 1891, became one of the most influential guitar players in Lisbon, leaving a vast repertoire of variations and ''fados'' behind. Following in his footsteps came other guitarists, such as [[Jaime Santos]], Raul Nery, Jos\u00e9 Nunes, Carlos Gon\u00e7alves and [[Fontes Rocha]]. [[Artur Paredes]], born in 1899, was an equally important player in the city of Coimbra.  Many of today's Coimbra guitar features can be traced back to his contact with local luthiers.  His son [[Carlos Paredes]] was a virtuoso and attained great popularity, becoming the most internationally known Portuguese guitar player.  His compositions on the Portuguese guitar go beyond the traditional use of the instrument in ''fado'' musicianship giving him (and the instrument) a status above folk or regional music. This soloistic tradition has been followed till today by several outstanding musicians such as Pedro Caldeira Cabral, Antonio Chainho, Ricardo Rocha, Paulo Soares, and several other virtuoso guitarists of the younger generation. The first concerto for Portuguese guitar and orchestra in history was composed and premiered by Pedro Henriques da Silva on December 5th, 2017 with the Orchestra of the Swan at Stratford ArtsHouse in Stratford-upon-Avon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planethugill.com/2017/12/concerto-first-pedro-da-silva-oots.html|title=Concerto first: Pedro Da Silva & OOTS premiere work for Portuguese guitar|website=www.planethugill.com}}</ref>.\n\nMany leading ''guitarristas'' in Lisboa\u2014Mario Pacheco, Luis Guerreiro, Jose Manuel Neto, Henrique Leit\u00e3o, Bruno Chaveiro, Paulo de Castro, Ricardo Martins and Custodio Castelo - now use Oscar Cardoso ''guitarras'', which feature the extraordinary innovation of a cutaway in the back of the ''guitarra'', and a Coimbra string length but with Lisboa tuning. The virtuosity of these artists has changed the sound of ''fado'' radically, and their speed is extraordinary. Rocha has composed highly avant-garde pieces, and the original ''guitarradas'' of Pacheco, Castelo and Martins have become common repertoire in Lisboa, as those of Soares have become in Coimbra. Most advanced players will learn some of Carlos Paredes' difficult works. Marta Pereira Da Costa has achieved prominence as the first female virtuoso ''guitarrista.''\n\n===Outside Portuguese music===\nThe Portuguese guitar played a small role in Celtic and western folk music following the folk revival. In the 1970s, [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] of the band [[Planxty]] played a modified Portuguese guitar.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Magnussen|first1=Paul|title=Liam O'Flynn & Andy Irvine in conversation with Paul Magnussen|url=http://www.andyirvine.com/disc/interview.html|publisher=Guitar International (unpublished), 1982|accessdate=22 June 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923172212/http://www.andyirvine.com/disc/interview.html|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref> British luthier Stefan Sobell based his early 1970s creation of the [[Cittern#Modern citterns|modern cittern]] on a Portuguese guitar he'd bought at a used shop in Leeds some years previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sobellguitars.com/how-i-started-my-first-cittern/|title=Stefan Sobell Guitars \u00bb How I started: my first cittern|website=www.sobellguitars.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Frets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E_aAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=GPI Publications}}</ref>\n\nSeveral jazz musicians have also recorded with the Portuguese guitar, including [[Brad Shepik]].<ref name=\"BogdanovWoodstra2002\">{{cite book|author1=Vladimir Bogdanov|author2=Chris Woodstra|author3=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=All Music Guide to Jazz: The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yXVEjS-j8IC&pg=PT971|year=2002|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=978-0-87930-717-2|pages=971\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Inc.1998\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2Q4EAAAAMBAJ|date=21 March 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_2Q4EAAAAMBAJ/page/n96 97]\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese guitar features prominently on [[Sun Kil Moon]]'s debut album ''[[Ghosts Of The Great Highway]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectrumculture.com/2014/02/11/sun-kil-moon-benji/|title=Sun Kil Moon: Benji - Album Review|date=11 February 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBritish guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]] plays the instrument on the [[Yes (band)|Yes]] songs \"[[I've Seen All Good People]]\" from ''[[The Yes Album]]'' (1971), \"[[Wonderous Stories]]\" from ''[[Going for the One]]'' (1977), also on \"Hour of Need\" from ''[[Fly from Here]]'' (2011) and finally on ''To Ascend'' from ''[[Heaven & Earth (Yes album)|Heaven and Earth]]'' (2014).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/features/2013/01/31/steve-howe-a-roundabout-way-to-yes?2|title=Steve Howe: A Roundabout Way to Yes|publisher=JamBands.com|first=Randy|last=Ray|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Portuguese guitar makers==\nThere are many Portuguese guitar makers still building guitars, according to traditional craftsmanship. Many families have passed on their knowledge for generations.\nAmongst the most notable ''guitarreiros'', or guitar makers, are the [[Gr\u00e1cio]] family, \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, the Tavares family (now living in Toronto Canada), the Cardoso family\u2014particularly Oscar Cardoso (whose guitarras are the subject of a recent book), Ant\u00f3nio Guerra, Domingos Machado, Fernando Meireles, Antonio Monteiro and Domingos Cerqueira. The Gr\u00e1cio family and \u00c1lvaro Ferreira's instruments are usually considered as the pinnacle in terms of quality, although these instruments are very hard to find and can be quite expensive. \n\nAntonio Pinto de Carvalho's APC luthiery is one of the largest in Europe, and produces thousands of traditional Portuguese stringed instruments. \n\n==Tuning==\n[[File:LisboaTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa (Lisboa tuning)]]\n[[File:CoimbraTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra (Coimbra tuning)]]\n[[File:NaturalTuning.png|thumb|Afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural (Natural tuning)]]\n\nThe tuning chiefly employed on the Portuguese guitar was historically called ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado'' or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o do fado corrido''. It was probably developed in the early 19th century, as it was already largely adopted by Lisbon's ''fadistas'' by the mid-century. With the diminishing use of the natural tuning (see below) by players, this tuning came to simply be called either ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa'', when tuned high, in D, or ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Coimbra'', when tuned low, in C; this stems from the fact that while most Lisbon Fado players tuned their guitars in D, in Coimbra the students came to tune theirs in C as standard practice, mainly through the influence of Artur Paredes. It is important to note, however, that regardless of the difference in pitch between the two variations of the tuning, in practice, the latter still makes use of the former's aural conventions, as such a ''do/''C is called ''re/''D, a D is called ''mi/''E, etc., by the players (essentially making a Coimbra-tuned Portuguese guitar a [[transposing instrument]] similar to a B-flat trumpet in that a given note is referred to by the note name a whole step higher than the note name that [[Concert pitch|concert-pitch]] conventions would use).\n\nThe natural tuning, inherited from the [[English guitar|English guittar]] of the 18th century, was also very frequently employed up to the first half of the 20th century, being preferred to the former by some late-19th-century players; it was frequently tuned in E instead of C, as this simplified the change between the ''fado'' tuning for players who used both. Some variations of this tuning were also adopted, such as the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural com 4\u00aa'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o da Mouraria'', or the ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o de Jo\u00e3o de Deus'', also known as ''afina\u00e7\u00e3o natural menor''. The natural tuning and its variations have been for the most part, out of practice for several decades.\n\n== Notation ==\nThe Portuguese guitar can read Portuguese guitar tablature, sheet music in treble, or a combination of both.  The ''dedilho'' technique is notated with up and down arrows over multiple notes corresponding to a downstroke or upstroke of the index finger.  An \"i\" is used to indicate a stroke with the index finger, or ''indicador'', and a \"p\" is used for the thumb, or ''pulgar''.  The middle finger is rarely used but notated with an \"m\" for ''m\u00e9dio''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Soares|first=Paulo|title=M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa|publisher=Paulo Soares|year=1997|isbn=|location=Coimbra|pages=}}</ref>\n\nWhile one can find many virtuosic Coimbra pieces written out as sheet music, ''fados'' are generally improvised and require no music for a good ''guitarrista'' to play.  The chord progression to each specific ''fado'' should be understood by the good ''guitarrista''.  While this skill has traditionally been acquired by younger players playing alongside a more advanced ''guitarrista'' in an ensemble, it was only in the early 2000s that the first ''fado'' school had been established to formally teach the improvisational style alongside the written version.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Anaia Cristo|first=Nuno Jos\u00e9 dos Santos|date=JANUARY 2014|title=THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR: HISTORY AND TRANSFORMATION OF AN INSTRUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH FADO|url=yorkspace.library.yorku.ca|journal=A Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Arts|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | title = A Guitarra Portuguesa\n | first = Pedro\n | last = Caldeira Cabral\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Ediclube\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-719-077-4\n}} &mdash; THE PORTUGUESE GUITAR\n* {{cite book\n | title = The Portuguese Guitar Chord Bible: Lisboa Tuning 1,728 Chords\n | first = Tobe A.\n | last = Richards\n | location = United Kingdom\n | publisher = Cabot Books\n | year = 2009\n | isbn = 978-1-906207-13-7\n}} &mdash; A comprehensive chord dictionary for the Portuguese Lisboa Guitar\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa Vol. 1: Bases para a Guitarra de Coimbra\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 1999\n | isbn = 972-97496-0-4\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = M\u00e9todo de Guitarra Portuguesa, Vol. 2: Dom\u00ednio dos Acordes\n | first = Paulo\n | last = Soares\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Paulo Soares\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-972-97496-1-2\n}} &mdash; Chord building {{in lang|pt}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Guitarra Magica Fado\n | first = Eurico Augusto\n | last = Cebolo\n | location = Portugal\n | publisher = Unknown\n | isbn = 972-8019-07-6\n}} &mdash; Basic techniques for the Portuguese Coimbra Guitar {{in lang|pt}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandolim]]\n*[[Viola braguesa]]\n*[[Rabeca]]\n*[[Gaita transmontana]]\n*[[Cavaquinho]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110926110703/http://www.musinaction.pt/media/site_docs/pdf_67_16928_PGAcoustics_-_Part_1.pdf Acoustic analysis of Portuguese guitars] <sup>(Retrieved on 24-09-2013)</sup>\n* [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.vu.carlosfernandes.guitarraportuguesa Portuguese Guitar for Android]\n{{Guitars}}\n\n{{Portugal topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Portuguese Guitar}}\n[[Category:Fado]]\n[[Category:Guitars]]\n[[Category:Portuguese musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Necked box lutes]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "De-cap", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_guitar"}

In contrast, ''brother'' is an inalienable entity; a brother cannot exist without someone else to be in relation to. Thus, ''brother'' requires possessive morphology, as exampled in ''s\u0259\u026ctsen'' 'my brother'.<ref name=\"grammar\" />\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe basic lexical verb in Witsuwit\u02bcen is the verb theme, a unit composed of two parts: a verbal root and required thematic prefixes.<ref name=\"grammar\" />\n\nVerbal morpheme order is stable throughout the Athabaskan family; thus, the template of the Witstuwit\u02bcen verb is very similar to other Athabaskan languages.<ref name=\"tuttle\">Tuttle, Siri G. 2002.

Subjects of transitive and intransitive constructions are marked in the same way and appear in identical positions within the sentence, while objects of transitive constructions may differ in position and occasionally in morphological form. Subjects are marked in different places within the verbal complex, with 1st and 2nd person subjects appearing more closely to the verb stem and 3rd person subjects and direct objects further to the left.<ref name=\":3\">Rice, Keren (2000).

However, the term ''classifier'' is recognized among Athabaskanists as a misnomer; ''[[Voice (grammar)|voice]]'' and ''[[Valency (linguistics)|valence]] markers'' are more appropriate descriptors.<ref name=\":3\" /> Each lexical entry of Witsuwit\u02bcen verbs features a lexicalized voice/valence marker fused with the verb stem, though this element sometimes appears as zero. The classifiers [\u026c] and [d] regulate transitivity: [\u026c] increases transitivity by creating causatives and the [d] classifier lowers transitivity to create middle voice. The valence marker [l] is more complex in nature, indicating a combination of [\u026c] and [d] where a middle is built upon a causative.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Words and phrases==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Directional terms are considered to be a lexical group in Witsuwit\u02bcen found throughout lexical categories.<ref name=\"grammar\">{{Cite book|title=Witsuwit\u02bcen Grammar: Phonetics, phonology, morphology|last=Hargus|first=Sharon|publisher=UBC Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0774813822|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Nouns ====\nWitsuwit\u02bcen nouns are only inflected for [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]], and no case marking exists in Witsuwit\u02bcen.<ref name=\"grammar\" /> Possessive morphology takes different forms depending on whether the [[referent]] is alienable or [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Alienable\n!Inalienable\n|-\n|'''c\u02bc\u0259ni'''\n|'''s - \u0259\u026ctsen'''\n|-\n|trap.bait\n|<small>1.SG.POSS</small>-brother\n|-\n|'trap bait'\n|'my brother\n|}\nBecause ''trap bait'' is an alienable entity which need not be possessed by anyone/anything, it does not include any possessive morphology but stands alone in its bare form. In contrast, ''brother'' is an inalienable entity; a brother cannot exist without someone else to be in relation to. Thus, ''brother'' requires possessive morphology, as exampled in ''s\u0259\u026ctsen'' 'my brother'.<ref name=\"grammar\" />\n\n==== Verbs ====\nThe basic lexical verb in Witsuwit\u02bcen is the verb theme, a unit composed of two parts: a verbal root and required thematic prefixes.<ref name=\"grammar\" />\n\nVerbal morpheme order is stable throughout the Athabaskan family; thus, the template of the Witstuwit\u02bcen verb is very similar to other Athabaskan languages.<ref name=\"tuttle\">Tuttle, Siri G. 2002.

Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin Arbeitspapiere zur Linguistik 37.</ref> Prefixes which are furthest away from the lexical stem display more variability. The Witsuwit\u02bcen verb consists of a lexical root and an aspectual, tense, or modal affix (most often a suffix). All Witsuwit\u02bcen verbs carry tense and subject inflection; there is no Witsuwit\u02bcen equivalent to the English [[infinitive]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Denham|first=Kristin|date=2000|year=|title=Optional Wh-Movement in Babine-Witsuwit\u02bcen|url=|journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory|volume=|pages=199\u2013251|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Postpositions ====\nPostpositional object marking is demonstrated in the examples below. [[Preposition and postposition|Postpositions]] can stand by themselves, as in the example '<nowiki/>''3s was playing with it'','  or attach to the verbal complex.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Gunlogson|first=Christine|date=2001|title=Third-Person Object Prefixes in Babine Witsuwit\u02bcen|url=|journal=International Journal of American Linguistics|volume=67|pages=365\u2013395|doi=10.1086/466468|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n:'''<u>Yi</u>-lh        niwilyekh'''.\n:with-3s     3s-plays\n:'3s was playing with <u>it</u>.'\n\n==== Directional terms ====\nComplex directional systems and directional terms have been described in [[Ahtna language|Ahtna]], [[Slavey language|Slavey]], [[Kaska language|Kaska]], [[Koyukon language|Koyukon]], [[Tsek'ene language|Tsek'ene]], and Witsuwit\u02bcen. Directional terms are composed of a directional root, prefixes which describe distance, and suffixes which indicate motion or rest.<ref name=\"grammar\" />\n\n=== Syntax ===\nLike most Athabaskan languages, basic [[word order]] in Babine-Witsuwit\u02bcen is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), demonstrated in the example below.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n:'''Mary   dilhtsen               yik\u02bc\u00ebntsiy\u02bc'''\n:Mary    3.<small>SG.REFL</small>.brother  3.<small>SG</small>.loves.3.<small>SG</small>.\n:'Mary loves her own brother.'\n\n==== Grammatical relations ====\nBabine-Witsuwit\u02bcen uses verbal morphology to express grammatical roles. Subjects of transitive and intransitive constructions are marked in the same way and appear in identical positions within the sentence, while objects of transitive constructions may differ in position and occasionally in morphological form. Subjects are marked in different places within the verbal complex, with 1st and 2nd person subjects appearing more closely to the verb stem and 3rd person subjects and direct objects further to the left.<ref name=\":3\">Rice, Keren (2000).

However, the term ''classifier'' is recognized among Athabaskanists as a misnomer; ''[[Voice (grammar)|voice]]'' and ''[[Valency (linguistics)|valence]] markers'' are more appropriate descriptors.<ref name=\":3\" /> Each lexical entry of Witsuwit\u02bcen verbs features a lexicalized voice/valence marker fused with the verb stem, though this element sometimes appears as zero. The classifiers [\u026c] and [d] regulate transitivity: [\u026c] increases transitivity by creating causatives and the [d] classifier lowers transitivity to create middle voice. The valence marker [l] is more complex in nature, indicating a combination of [\u026c] and [d] where a middle is built upon a causative.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Words and phrases==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With his team trailing 4\u20133 in the top half of the ninth inning and two out, [[George Brett]] of the Royals hit a two-run [[home run]] to give his team the lead.

The umpires ruled that the amount of pine tar on the bat exceeded the amount allowed by rule, nullified Brett's home run, and called him [[out (baseball)|out]]. As Brett was the third out in the ninth inning with the home team in the lead, the game ended with a Yankees win.<ref name=\"bud black\">http://local.sandiego.com/sports/padres-manager-bud-black-relives-george-bretts-pine-tar-incident  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802195546/http://local.sandiego.com/sports/padres-manager-bud-black-relives-george-bretts-pine-tar-incident |date=August 2, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Royals [[Protested game|protested the game]], and American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] upheld their protest.

George Brett came to the plate and connected off Yankees reliever [[Goose Gossage|Rich \"Goose\" Gossage]] for a two-run [[home run]] and a 5\u20134 lead.<ref name = \"bud black\"/>\n\nAs Brett crossed the plate, New York manager [[Billy Martin]] approached rookie home plate umpire [[Tim McClelland]] and requested Brett's bat be examined. Before the game, Martin and other members of the Yankees had noticed the amount of [[pine tar]] used by Brett, but Martin had chosen not to say anything until it was strategically useful to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/67 |title=Pine tar nullifies home run, so Brett goes ballistic |accessdate=2009-12-03}}</ref>  Yankees third baseman [[Graig Nettles]] recalled a similar incident involving [[Thurman Munson]] in a {{By|1975}} game against the [[1975 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1975/B07190MIN1975.htm|title=Retrosheet Boxscore: Minnesota Twins 2, New York Yankees 1|accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> In Nettles' autobiography ''Balls'', Nettles claims that he actually informed Martin of the pine tar rule, as Nettles had previously undergone the same scrutiny with his own bat while with the Twins.\n\nWith Brett watching from the dugout, McClelland and the rest of the umpiring crew, [[Drew Coble]], [[Joe Brinkman]], and [[Nick Bremigan]], inspected the bat. Measuring the bat against the width of [[home plate]] (which is {{convert|17|in|cm|disp=or||}} wide), they determined that the amount of [[pine tar]] on the bat's handle exceeded that allowed by Rule 1.10(c) of the Major League Baseball rule book, which read that \"a bat may not be covered by such a substance more than {{convert|18|in|disp=sqbr|cm||}} from the tip of the handle.\" At the time, such a hit was defined in the rules as \"an illegally batted ball,\" and under the terms of the then-existing provisions of Rule 6.06, any batter who hit an illegally batted ball was automatically called out. The umpires concluded that under this interpretation, Brett's home run was disallowed, and he was out, thus ending the game.\n\nMcClelland searched for Brett in the visitors' dugout, pointed at him with the bat, and signaled that he was out, handing the Yankees a 4\u20133 win. An enraged Brett ran out of the dugout and confronted McClelland, requiring him to be physically restrained by his manager [[Dick Howser]], several of his teammates, and umpire Joe Brinkman. (As one commentator noted, \"Brett had the ignominious distinction of hitting a game-''losing'' home run.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=McKenzie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyX1-UG7hQwC&lpg=PA77&dq=brett%20%22a%20game-losing%20home%20run%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Umpires' Ruling Beats the Tar Out of Royals |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=July 25, 1983\n|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>) Despite the furious protests of Brett and Howser, McClelland's ruling stood.\n\n==Protest and reversal==\n[[File:Lee MacPhail 2004.jpg|thumb|right|American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] ruled that Brett's home run counted.]]\nThe Royals protested the game. Four days later, [[American League]] president [[Lee MacPhail]] upheld the Royals' protest. In explaining his decision, MacPhail noted that the \"spirit of the restriction\" on pine tar on bats was based not on the fear of unfair advantage, but simple economics; any contact with pine tar would discolor the ball, render it unsuitable for play, and require that it be discarded and replaced\u2014thus increasing the home team's cost of supplying balls for a given game. MacPhail ruled that Brett had not violated the spirit of the rules nor deliberately \"altered [the bat] to improve the distance factor\".\n\nMacPhail's ruling followed precedent established after a protest in 1975 of the September 7 game played between the Royals and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |title=The pine tar games from |publisher=The Hardball Times |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203005623/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |archivedate=February 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In that game, the umpiring crew had declined to negate one of [[John Mayberry]]'s home runs for excessive pine tar use. MacPhail, who also heard this protest, upheld the umpires' decision with the view that the intent of the rule was to prevent baseballs from being discolored during game play and that any discoloration that may have occurred to a ball leaving the ballpark did not affect the game's competitive balance.\n\nMacPhail thus restored Brett's home run and ordered the game resumed with two outs in the top of the ninth inning with the Royals leading 5\u20134. Although MacPhail ruled that Brett's home run counted, he retroactively [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] Brett for his outburst against McClelland. He also ejected Howser and coach [[Rocky Colavito]] for arguing with the umpires, and Royals pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]] for giving the bat to the bat boy so he could hide it in the clubhouse.\n\n==Conclusion==\n===Strategic maneuvering===\nThe Yankees resisted the resumption of the game, and waited until near the end of the season to agree to it, to see if the game would have an effect on the standings or should be forfeited.<ref name=Pittsburgh>{{cite news |title=Yankees, Royals, courts put an end to Tar Wars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v6lRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pm0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=orest-maresca%20joseph-sullivan&pg=7082%2C4514160 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 19, 1983 |page=13 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter ordering the resumption of gameplay, MacPhail and other league officials held a strategy session to anticipate tricks the Yankees might use to prevent the game from continuing.<ref name=Norwalk>{{cite news |title=MacPhail's Folly |first=Dick |last=Young |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nDRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tQYNAAAAIBAJ&dq=bob-fishel%20affidavit%20martin&pg=2117%2C3226978 |newspaper=The Hour |location=Norwalk, Conn. |date=August 22, 1983 |page=17 |quote=After MacPhail ordered the Yanks and KC to play the last of the ninth inning, Lee and Bob Fishel and others in the league office held a meeting to discuss counter-strategy.

Measuring the bat against the width of [[home plate]] (which is {{convert|17|in|cm|disp=or||}} wide), they determined that the amount of [[pine tar]] on the bat's handle exceeded that allowed by Rule 1.10(c) of the Major League Baseball rule book, which read that \"a bat may not be covered by such a substance more than {{convert|18|in|disp=sqbr|cm||}} from the tip of the handle.\" At the time, such a hit was defined in the rules as \"an illegally batted ball,\" and under the terms of the then-existing provisions of Rule 6.06, any batter who hit an illegally batted ball was automatically called out. The umpires concluded that under this interpretation, Brett's home run was disallowed, and he was out, thus ending the game.\n\nMcClelland searched for Brett in the visitors' dugout, pointed at him with the bat, and signaled that he was out, handing the Yankees a 4\u20133 win. An enraged Brett ran out of the dugout and confronted McClelland, requiring him to be physically restrained by his manager [[Dick Howser]], several of his teammates, and umpire Joe Brinkman. (As one commentator noted, \"Brett had the ignominious distinction of hitting a game-''losing'' home run.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=McKenzie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UyX1-UG7hQwC&lpg=PA77&dq=brett%20%22a%20game-losing%20home%20run%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Umpires' Ruling Beats the Tar Out of Royals |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=July 25, 1983\n|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref>) Despite the furious protests of Brett and Howser, McClelland's ruling stood.\n\n==Protest and reversal==\n[[File:Lee MacPhail 2004.jpg|thumb|right|American League president [[Lee MacPhail]] ruled that Brett's home run counted.]]\nThe Royals protested the game. Four days later, [[American League]] president [[Lee MacPhail]] upheld the Royals' protest. In explaining his decision, MacPhail noted that the \"spirit of the restriction\" on pine tar on bats was based not on the fear of unfair advantage, but simple economics; any contact with pine tar would discolor the ball, render it unsuitable for play, and require that it be discarded and replaced\u2014thus increasing the home team's cost of supplying balls for a given game. MacPhail ruled that Brett had not violated the spirit of the rules nor deliberately \"altered [the bat] to improve the distance factor\".\n\nMacPhail's ruling followed precedent established after a protest in 1975 of the September 7 game played between the Royals and the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |title=The pine tar games from |publisher=The Hardball Times |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203005623/http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/printarticle/the-pine-tar-games/ |archivedate=February 3, 2013 }}</ref>  In that game, the umpiring crew had declined to negate one of [[John Mayberry]]'s home runs for excessive pine tar use. MacPhail, who also heard this protest, upheld the umpires' decision with the view that the intent of the rule was to prevent baseballs from being discolored during game play and that any discoloration that may have occurred to a ball leaving the ballpark did not affect the game's competitive balance.\n\nMacPhail thus restored Brett's home run and ordered the game resumed with two outs in the top of the ninth inning with the Royals leading 5\u20134. Although MacPhail ruled that Brett's home run counted, he retroactively [[Ejection (sports)|ejected]] Brett for his outburst against McClelland. He also ejected Howser and coach [[Rocky Colavito]] for arguing with the umpires, and Royals pitcher [[Gaylord Perry]] for giving the bat to the bat boy so he could hide it in the clubhouse.\n\n==Conclusion==\n===Strategic maneuvering===\nThe Yankees resisted the resumption of the game, and waited until near the end of the season to agree to it, to see if the game would have an effect on the standings or should be forfeited.<ref name=Pittsburgh>{{cite news |title=Yankees, Royals, courts put an end to Tar Wars |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=v6lRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pm0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=orest-maresca%20joseph-sullivan&pg=7082%2C4514160 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 19, 1983 |page=13 |accessdate=June 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter ordering the resumption of gameplay, MacPhail and other league officials held a strategy session to anticipate tricks the Yankees might use to prevent the game from continuing.<ref name=Norwalk>{{cite news |title=MacPhail's Folly |first=Dick |last=Young |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nDRJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tQYNAAAAIBAJ&dq=bob-fishel%20affidavit%20martin&pg=2117%2C3226978 |newspaper=The Hour |location=Norwalk, Conn. |date=August 22, 1983 |page=17 |quote=After MacPhail ordered the Yanks and KC to play the last of the ninth inning, Lee and Bob Fishel and others in the league office held a meeting to discuss counter-strategy.
