He got his first guitar on his twelfth birthday and taught himself to play by watching instructional videos and reading chord books.  He has since taught himself to play multiple instruments. He cites the movie \"[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]\" and [[Michael J. Fox]]'s guitar performance in the movie \"[[Back to the Future]]\" as his inspiration for wanting to become a musician.\n\nZinsman is a 1993 graduate of [[St. Louis School]] ''(Honolulu, Hi.)'' where he was a standout [[offensive lineman]] and played on three of The Crusaders' 14 straight State Championship teams under two-time National Coach of The Year and the most prolific coach in Hawaii high school football history, [[Cal Lee]].

In December 2002, \"Three Plus\" performed at the [[Monterey County Fairgrounds]] in [[Monterey, California]] to a crowd of over 10,000.  'The Fairgrounds' is best known for hosting the annual [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which embodies the themes of California as a focal point for the [[counterculture]].  It is also the event and venue which popularized artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[The Who]] in America, and launched the beginnings of the 1967 \"[[Summer of Love]]\". Due to their large population of [[Pacific Islander]]s, [[Polynesians]] and \"transplanted\" [[Native Hawaiians]] (people of [[Hawaii]]an ancestry or former Hawaii residents that now live on the U.S. Mainland), \"Three Plus\" has become enormously popular among the states along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Three Plus's  version of [[Bob Marley]]'s 1978 hit song \"[[Is This Love (Bob Marley song)|Is This Love]]\", performed by Zinsman, was featured on the compilation album ''Putamayo Presents: \"A Tribute To A Reggae Legend: Bob Marley\"''.<ref>http://www.staradvertiser.com/features/20100723_5_Things_We_Love.html</ref> The album, released in the [[Netherlands]], is currently available in 10 different countries and has sold close 200,000 copies to date.

Most of their music are still in heavy rotation on a variety of radio stations across the states of [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], [[California]] as well as [[Guam]], [[Tahiti]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]].\n\nHowever, in 2007 Zinsman left the group to pursue other endeavors and re-located to the [[Big Island of Hawaii]].\n\n==Hi-Town==\nUpon relocating, Zinsman decided to take a lesser \"up front\" role as an artist and focused more on producing, managing  and developing other acts.  In 2008, he formed the island [[reggae music]] [[sextet]] '''Hi-Town''' (short for Hilo town) and in 2010 they released their self-entitled debut album to rave reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hitown |title=Hi Town &#124; Hi Town |publisher=CD Baby |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>  Produced by Zinsman, the ''Hi-Town'' album would go on to win the 2010 [[Hawaii Music Award]] for Island Contemporary Album of The Year, as well as produce five number one singles, (\"You're Beautiful\", \"All We Need\", \"Run & Hide\" ft. [[O-Shen]] & Damon Williams, \"He Come, He Go\" and \"Lose Your Love\").   On August 12, 2010, \"Hi-Town\" released a follow up single to their debut album entitled \"With You\".

The group released their debut single \"Kalapana Way\" on August 1, 2014 to help push the release of their upcoming album. The up tempo \"[[hapa]]-haole\" single, which speaks of the humble way of life residents live in the peaceful community of [[Kalapana, Hawaii]]; charted respectably well on most statewide radio stations and continues to be in heavy rotation. '''The Brown Boys''' released their self-entitled debut album on June 15, 2015. The album features 7 original tracks and an array of talented guest musicians from the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]]. Their single \"Riding The World\", written by Zinsman, was featured on an episode of [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]. '''The Brown Boys''' have been a staple of the island music scene on The Big Island for over 8 years performing at all major events, concerts and club venues; even sharing the stage with [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] legend [[Neil Young]] at his home in [[Puako, Hawaii]].

The concert was released as a 2-disk [[DVD]] package entitled [[Janet Jackson - Live In Hawaii]] on September 3, 2002 and was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries.\n\nOver the years, Three Plus has performed alongside some of the most renowned and top [[reggae]] music acts in the world, including: [[Maxi Priest]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Inner Circle (reggae band)|Inner Circle]], [[Morgan Heritage]], [[Third World (band)]] and [[Messenjah]].\n\nOn February 19, 2002, \"Three Plus\" released their second album, entitled ''For You'', which was another commercial success, winning the 2003 [[Na Hoku Hanohano Award]] for Reggae Album of The Year.<ref>[http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_bio/artist_526713 Hi-Town: About This Artist.] reverbnation.com, 2010.

In December 2002, \"Three Plus\" performed at the [[Monterey County Fairgrounds]] in [[Monterey, California]] to a crowd of over 10,000.  'The Fairgrounds' is best known for hosting the annual [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which embodies the themes of California as a focal point for the [[counterculture]].  It is also the event and venue which popularized artists like [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[The Who]] in America, and launched the beginnings of the 1967 \"[[Summer of Love]]\". Due to their large population of [[Pacific Islander]]s, [[Polynesians]] and \"transplanted\" [[Native Hawaiians]] (people of [[Hawaii]]an ancestry or former Hawaii residents that now live on the U.S. Mainland), \"Three Plus\" has become enormously popular among the states along the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] of the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Three Plus's  version of [[Bob Marley]]'s 1978 hit song \"[[Is This Love (Bob Marley song)|Is This Love]]\", performed by Zinsman, was featured on the compilation album ''Putamayo Presents: \"A Tribute To A Reggae Legend: Bob Marley\"''.<ref>http://www.staradvertiser.com/features/20100723_5_Things_We_Love.html</ref> The album, released in the [[Netherlands]], is currently available in 10 different countries and has sold close 200,000 copies to date. In 2009, the song \"Shade On Me\" was featured on several episodes of the [[A&E Network]]'s television show ''[[Parking Wars]]'', which is [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] in five different countries.  Most of their music are still in heavy rotation on a variety of radio stations across the states of [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], [[California]] as well as [[Guam]], [[Tahiti]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]].\n\nHowever, in 2007 Zinsman left the group to pursue other endeavors and re-located to the [[Big Island of Hawaii]].\n\n==Hi-Town==\nUpon relocating, Zinsman decided to take a lesser \"up front\" role as an artist and focused more on producing, managing  and developing other acts.  In 2008, he formed the island [[reggae music]] [[sextet]] '''Hi-Town''' (short for Hilo town) and in 2010 they released their self-entitled debut album to rave reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hitown |title=Hi Town &#124; Hi Town |publisher=CD Baby |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}</ref>  Produced by Zinsman, the ''Hi-Town'' album would go on to win the 2010 [[Hawaii Music Award]] for Island Contemporary Album of The Year, as well as produce five number one singles, (\"You're Beautiful\", \"All We Need\", \"Run & Hide\" ft. [[O-Shen]] & Damon Williams, \"He Come, He Go\" and \"Lose Your Love\").   On August 12, 2010, \"Hi-Town\" released a follow up single to their debut album entitled \"With You\".   The single obtained moderate success on local radio stations in Hawaii, peaking at #2 on some charts.  Their single \"Sunshine In My Life\" is featured on the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] based radio station, Pipeline 2 Paradise: Paradise Pa'ina Vol.1 CD Compilation.\n\n==The Brown Boys==\n'''The Brown Boys''' perform in the Island Contemporary/ Country Music genre and are currently based out of [[Puna, Hawaii]]. The group released their debut single \"Kalapana Way\" on August 1, 2014 to help push the release of their upcoming album. The up tempo \"[[hapa]]-haole\" single, which speaks of the humble way of life residents live in the peaceful community of [[Kalapana, Hawaii]]; charted respectably well on most statewide radio stations and continues to be in heavy rotation. '''The Brown Boys''' released their self-entitled debut album on June 15, 2015. The album features 7 original tracks and an array of talented guest musicians from the [[Hawaii (island)|Big Island]] of [[Hawaii]]. Their single \"Riding The World\", written by Zinsman, was featured on an episode of [[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]. '''The Brown Boys''' have been a staple of the island music scene on The Big Island for over 8 years performing at all major events, concerts and club venues; even sharing the stage with [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] legend [[Neil Young]] at his home in [[Puako, Hawaii]]. Their second single \"You're All I Need\" charted on several radio stations across the [[Hawaiian Islands]] earning the #1 spot Aug.-Oct.2015.\n\n==Personal life==\nZinsman currently resides in [[Kea'au, Hawai'i]] with his wife and children.  He annually donates his time, money and efforts to no-profit organizations such as The [[American Cancer Society]], The Lokahi Giving Tree (Children of Hawaii Charity), Keiki 'O Ka Aina, The Japan Disaster Refief Fund, [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|D.A.R.E.]], [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys & Girls Club]] of Hawaii, [[Toys for Tots]], [[Relay For Life]] and also to the children and families in need throughout his community.

The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds, because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels.

This made it a popular choice for web designers, as pages specifying Georgia as a font choice would display identically on both types if users installed the core fonts package (or later Internet Explorer), simplifying development and testing.

With three goals in six matches, as the Danish national youth team won silver medals at the [[1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship]], Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r showed himself one of the brightest talents in Danish football. He was named 1995 [[Danish Football Player of the Year#Young Players of the Year|Danish Under-19 Player of the Year]]. In total, he scored 26 goals in 64 Danish youth team international games.\n\nIn his first year at Ajax, Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r made his full international debut for the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]] in the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|2000 European Championship]] (Euro 2000) qualification game against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 27 March 1999. In the very first minute of the game, he famously echoed [[Jesper Olsen]]'s [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] mistimed backpass to [[Spain|Spanish]] forward [[Emilio Butrague\u00f1o]], as Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r passed the ball to [[Italy|Italian]] forward [[Filippo Inzaghi]] who promptly scored the first goal in Italy's 2\u20131 victory.<ref>{{cite news | first = Rasmus | last = Bech | title = Den aften, da Jesper Olsen blev glemt | publisher = [[Politiken]] | date = 28 March 1999 | language = Danish}}</ref> Despite the disappointing debut game, Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r became an important part of the national team under coach [[Bo Johansson]] and he played full-time in Denmark's three games at the Euro 2000 main tournament.\n\nWhile at Chelsea, Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r became a mainstay in the Denmark national team under new national team coach Morten Olsen, and he played in all of Denmark's four games at the 2002 World Cup. In the qualification games for [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]], he scored the game-winning goal in a 1\u20130 victory over closest rivals [[Norway national football team|Norway]], helping Denmark qualify for the final tournament in [[Portugal]]. He missed the opening game of Euro 2004 due to the death of his mother, but went to Portugal to join the Danish squad and scored the second goal of the 2\u20130 win against [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]].\n\nHe was included in Olsen's squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1493391.html |title=Olsen names final Denmark squad |publisher=UEFA.com |date=28 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> After Denmark's elimination from the 2010 World Cup, Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r announced his retirement from international football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/sport/fodbold/landsholdsfodbold/vm2010/article1368230.ece |title=Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r stopper p\u00e5 landsholdet |last=Lauridsen |first=S\u00f8ren |publisher=[[Ekstra Bladet]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |date=24 June 2010 |language=Danish }}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Club statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!
