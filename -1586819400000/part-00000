[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], it is one of the five towns in the [[metropolitan borough]] of the [[City of Wakefield]] and had a population of 30,881 at the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13689956&c=Pontefract&d=14&e=62&g=6375159&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1456931390009&enc=1|title=Pontefract South Ward population 2011|accessdate=2 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13689955&c=Pontefract+north&d=14&e=62&g=6375158&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1456931773212&enc=1|title=Pontefract North Ward population 2011|accessdate=2 March 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref> Pontefract's motto is {{lang|la|Post mortem patris pro filio}}, [[Latin]] for \"After the death of the father, support the son\", a reference to the [[English Civil War]] Royalist sympathies.<ref>Padgett 170</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nAt the end of the 11th century, the modern [[Township#United Kingdom|township]] of Pontefract consisted of two distinct and separate localities known as Tanshelf and Kirkby.<ref>Eric Houlder, Ancient Roots North: When Pontefract Stood on the Great North Road, (Pontefract: Pontefract Groups Together, 2012) p.7.</ref>  The 11th-century historian, Orderic Vitalis, recorded that, in 1069, William the Conqueror travelled across Yorkshire to put down an uprising which had sacked York, but that, upon his journey to the city, he discovered that the crossing of the [[River Aire]] at what is modern-day Pontefract had been blockaded by a group of local [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] [[insurgent]]s, who had broken the bridge and held the opposite bank in force.<ref>Orderic Vitalis, ''Ecclesiastical History of England'', 2:27.</ref> Such a crossing point would have been important in the town's early days, providing access between Pontefract and other settlements to the north and east, such as York.<ref name=\"Ayto & Crofton\">Ayto & Crofton</ref> Historians believe that, in all probability, it is this historical event which gives the township of Pontefract its modern name. The name \"Pontefract\" originates from the Latin for \"broken bridge\", formed of the elements pons ('bridge') and fractus ('broken'). Pontefract was not recorded in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'', but it was noted as Pontefracto in 1090, four years after the Domesday survey.<ref>Frank Barlow, William I and the Norman Conquest (London: The English Universities Press, 1965) p.95.

The Roman Ridge is believed to form part of an alternative route from Doncaster to York via Castleford and Tadcaster, as a diversion of the major Roman road [[Ermine Street]], which may have been used to avoid having to cross the [[Humber|River Humber]] near [[North Ferriby]] during rough weather conditions over the Humber.\n\n===Anglo-Scandinavian history===\n\nThe period of Yorkshire's history between the demise of the Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and the arrival of the Normans in 1068 is known as the Anglo-Scandinavian age.  The modern township of Pontefract consisted of two Anglo-Scandinavian settlements, known as Tanshelf and Kirkby.  In Yorkshire, place-name locations often contain the distinctive Danish '-by' i.e. Kirkby.  And even today, the major streets in Pontefract are designated by the Danish word 'gate' e.g. Bailygate.\n\n====Tanshelf and Kirkby====\n\nThe Anglo-Scandinavian township of Tanshelf recorded variously as ''Tateshale'', ''Tateshalla'', ''Tateshalle'' or ''Tatessella'' in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'' existed in the region that is today occupied by the town of Pontefract.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes its first reference to Tanshelf in the year 947 when King Eadred of England met with the ruling council of Northumbria to accept its submission. King Eadred did not enjoy Northumbria's support for long, and a year later the kingdom voted Eric Bloodaxe King of York.<ref>[http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/vikingweb/Settlement.htm Towns in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213053252/http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/VikingWeb/Settlement.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}. ''Settlements in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire''. Retrieved 30 August 2014.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Domesday Book]] was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 Tanshelf was still a sizeable settlement for the period. The town had a priest, 60 petty burgesses, 16 cottagers, 16 villagers and 8 smallholders, amounting to a total of 101 people.  But the actual size of the population might be as much as four or five times larger than this as the people listed are landholders, and therefore the Doomsday Book does not take their families into account.  Tanshelf also had a church, a fishery and three mills.  Archaeologists have discovered the remains of the church on The Booths in Pontefract, off North Baileygate, below the castle. The oldest grave dates from around 690. The church is likely to be at Tanshelf and may have been similar to the church at [[Ledsham, West Yorkshire|Ledsham]].  The area which is now the town market place was the original meeting place of the [[Osgoldcross (wapentake)|Osgoldcross]] [[wapentake]].<ref>Hey</ref>  \nIn the Anglo-Saxon period a part of the modern township of Pontefract was known by the Anglo-Scandinavian name of Kirkby.\n\n===Medieval===\n\n====Norman conquest====\n[[File:Pontefract Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting of [[Pontefract Castle]] in the early 17th century by [[Alexander Keirincx]]]]\n\n{{main|de Lacy|Pontefract de Lacys' family tree}}\nAfter the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] in 1066 almost all of Yorkshire came under the ownership of followers of [[William the Conqueror]],<ref name=Ilbert>Fletcher 16\u201317</ref> one of whom was [[de Lacy|Ilbert de Lacy]] who became the owner of Tateshale (Tanshelf) where he began to build a castle.<ref name=Ilbert/>\n[[Pontefract Castle]] began as a wooden [[motte and bailey]] castle, built before 1086 and later rebuilt in stone.

The covered market is open all week, except Thursday afternoons and Sundays. Thursday afternoon is half-day closing in the town. The town is called 'Ponte'/'Ponty' by its citizens and sometimes jokingly referred to as Ponte Carlo, in reference to [[Monte Carlo]]. This theme is continued in the name of bars in the [[Xscape (building)|Xscape]] complex, [[Glasshoughton]] between Pontefract and [[Castleford]], referred to locally as 'Cas Vegas'. It is reported that Pontefract once held the British record for the town with the most pubs per square mile:{{by whom|date=April 2013}} indeed, numerous pubs still survive in the town centre in particular, for example Beastfair Vaults, the Liquorice Bush, the Red Lion, the Malt Shovel and the Blackmoor Head. A Wetherspoon public house opened on Horsefair in 2010.\n\nPontefract's deep, sandy soil makes it one of the few British places in which [[liquorice]] can successfully be grown.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The town has a liquorice-sweet industry; and the famous [[Pontefract cake]]s are produced, though the liquorice plant itself is no longer grown there. The town's two liquorice factories are owned by [[Haribo]] (formerly known as Dunhills) and Tangerine Confectionery (formerly part of the Cadbury's Group as Monkhill Confectionery, and before that Wilkinson's), respectively. A Liquorice Festival is held annually. [[Poet laureate]] [[Sir John Betjeman]] wrote a poem entitled \"The Licorice Fields at Pontefract\". In 2012 local farmer Robert Copley announced that he would be re-introducing a liquorice crop to Pontefract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rebecca Smithers|date=30 July 2012|title=Liquorice to grow again in Pontefract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/30/liquorice-pontefract|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2015|title=The Home of Liquorice|url=http://www.farmercopleys.co.uk/the-home-of-liquorice/|work=Farmer Copleys|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nClose by is the coal-fired [[Ferrybridge power station|power station]] at [[Ferrybridge]], although the local [[Coal mining|coal mines]] largely closed in the 1990s, contributing to high unemployment in the local area. The final colliery, Prince of Wales Colliery, closed in 2002.<ref>Thornton</ref>\n\nThere are a number of supermarkets in Pontefract which include a [[Tesco]] and [[Morrisons]] which are located opposite each other, and an [[Asda]], which was originally a Kwik Save store, a short distance outside the town centre. The secondary schools in the town are Carleton Community High School in Carleton, and the King's School on Mill Hill Lane, both for pupils aged 11\u201316. A sixth-form college, [[NEW College, Pontefract]], is located on Park Lane.\n\nThe old Pontefract General Infirmary on Southgate (pictured) was a general hospital; it is the place at which serial killer [[Harold Shipman]] began to murder his elderly patients. Beneath this building is an old [[Pontefract Hermitage|hermitage]], open to the public on certain days. [[Pontefract Museum]], from which the hermitage schedule can be obtained, is in the town centre, housed in the former [[Carnegie library]]. A new hospital was built on Friarwood and opened in 2010 with the new name of [[Pontefract Hospital]] and there is now a modern library building.\n\nNear to the hospital is Friarwood Valley Gardens, a rose garden, a sensory garden, a pinhole camera (formerly an aviary and earlier a Georgian gambling den), and an avenue of cherry trees. Friends of Friarwood Valley Gardens now work to improve it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nPontefract has three railway stations: [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]], on the [[Dearne Valley Line]], which connects [[York]] and [[Sheffield]]; and [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]] and [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]], which connects with [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. There are also rail services from Bradford to London that stop at [[Pontefract Monkhill]].\n\nThe local police force is West Yorkshire Police, with the town's neighbourhood policing team being situated at the new fire station on Stumpcross Lane. The original police station situated in Sessions House yard is due for closure since the new divisional headquarters for the Wakefield District opened in Normanton and the neighbouring magistrates' court has moved over to [[Leeds Magistrates Court|Leeds]] following the closure of the Wakefield and Pontefract courts..\n\nFire cover is provided by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue with one pump (sometimes two) based at Pontefract Fire Station. Formerly located on Stuart Road in the town centre, the station has now moved to a new site at Stumpcross Lane, by the A645 road at the town's eastern edge. The new fire station also provides cover for Knottingley, that town's fire station having been closed as part of the merging of fire cover for Pontefract and Knottingley.\n\nThe Territorial Army, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps all have a presence within the town and are based at the historic [[Pontefract Barracks]] building on Wakefield Road. It now houses a Rifles Regiment Recruitment team.\n\nA house is said to be haunted by a poltergeist, nicknamed The Black Monk of Pontefract.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O68ayjhr3O8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poltergeist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSuL33j5_mAhWaRhUIHZSGDR0Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=poltergeist&f=false|title=Poltergeist: A Classic Study in Destructive Hauntings|last=Wilson|first=Colin|date=2010-11-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=|isbn=978-0-7387-2237-5|location=|pages=67, 152|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Media, arts and entertainment==\nThe local newspaper is the ''Pontefract and Castleford Express''. Pontefract is known for its 'down-to-earth' nightlife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pontefract hotels|url=http://www.pontefracthotels.co.uk/}}</ref> Venues include The Red Lion, the Green Dragon, the Tap and Barrel, The Broken Bridge ([[Wetherspoons]]), the Malt Shovel, and the Ponty Tavern (formally The Blackmoor Head) or ''Blacky'' in local terms. In August 2012 one of Pontefract's oldest but most prestige nightclubs, Kiko's, re-opened its doors to the public after being closed since 2007, then closed again in 2013 due to the building being too far away from the town & other nightlife spots. Kiko's once hosted many notable performances back in the 1970s and 80s from notable bands such as The [[Bay City Rollers]]. As of Early 2020 the building is now vacant & severely damaged inside awaiting revival, venue change or demolition.\n\nNovelist [[Jack Vance]], in the \"[[Demon Princes]]\" cycle has named the capital of Aloysius, the main planet in the Vega system, after Pontefract. The hero of the series, Kirth Gersen, has his residence there.\n\n[[Ridings FM]] is the town's local commercial radio station, Launched in October 1999, [[Ridings FM]] can be heard across Pontefract on 106.8 FM. The station serves the wider [[Wakefield]] District. The station has a close relationship with the community and is actively involved in local charities' fundraising efforts.\n\n==Governance==\nFor local government purposes the town lies in the [[City of Wakefield]], coming under the governance of [[Wakefield Council]]. For this purpose it is divided into two electoral wards, Pontefract North and Pontefract South. Pontefract South is currently represented by three Labour councillors with North ward represented by three Labour councillors [as of September 2015].<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Councillors by Ward|url=http://mg.wakefield.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW=LIST&PIC=0|publisher=Wakefield Council|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> South ward is a marginal ward, containing relatively affluent suburbs of Pontefract and outlying villages such as Darrington, combined with less wealthy areas such as Chequerfield, whilst North Ward includes parts of Monkhill, Ladybalk, Nevison and Myson Chair.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1997 the local ex-miner and former local [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] branch leader [[Geoffrey Lofthouse, Baron Lofthouse of Pontefract|Geoff Lofthouse]] (18 December 1925&nbsp;\u2013 1 November 2012) was MP for the former constituency of Pontefract and Castleford. During this time he rose to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. When the general election of 1997 was called he stood down to allow [[Yvette Cooper]] to be selected as the Labour Party candidate for that election. He was made a peer on 11 June 1997.\n\nYvette Cooper [[Member of Parliament|MP]], was elected MP for the [[Pontefract and Castleford (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract and Castleford constituency]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Cooper held a number of positions in the Labour governments up to 2010, followed by Shadow Cabinet roles (most notably [[Shadow Home Secretary]]) after the election of that year, but returned to the back benches following the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour leadership election of 2015]]. Pontefract and Castleford was merged with the [[Normanton (UK Parliament constituency)|Normanton constituency]] in a boundary change before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nIn her maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Cooper said:<blockquote>It is true that my constituency is plagued by unemployment, but I represent hard-working people who are proud of their strong communities and who have fought hard across generations to defend them. They are proud of their socialist traditions, and have fought for a better future for their children and their grandchildren. In the Middle Ages, that early egalitarian, the real [[Robin Hood]], lived, so we maintain, in the [[Wentbridge|Vale of Wentbridge]] to the south of Pontefract. It was a great base from which to hassle the travelling [[fat cat (term)|fat cat]]s on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].</blockquote>\n\nThe seat, which has a history of mining and industry, has consistently returned Labour MPs at [[general elections]]. [[Yvette Cooper]] polled 59.5% of the vote in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe town is home to many sports including cricket, football and squash. Prominent squash players [[Lee Beachill]] and [[James Willstrop]] both train at Pontefract Squash Centre. Notable institutions are horse racing at [[Pontefract Racecourse]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]], the area's professional rugby league club.\n\nPontefract Racecourse is the longest continuous horse racing circuit in Europe at {{convert|2|mi|125|yd|m furlong}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Course Details&nbsp;\u2013 Pontefract Racecourse|url=http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|accessdate=4 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821184541/http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It stages flat racing between the end of March and the end of October. Pontefract swimming pool is on Stuart Road.\n\nPontefract has its own non-league football club, [[Pontefract Collieries F.C.]], which was founded in 1958 and plays adjacent to the former Prince of Wales Colliery off Beechnut Lane. The team, known locally as \"Ponte Colls\" play in the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One North West (correct as of the start of the 2019/20 season).\nPontefract is also home to the Pontefract Knights rugby league football club.\n\nPontefract RUFC is based at Moor Lane Carleton.  It runs three senior sides as well as a number of junior and girls teams.  Rugby Union has been played in the town since the 19th Century when Pontefract won the Yorkshire Cup.\n\nPontefract used to boast two cricket clubs, Lakeside CC (based in Pontefract Park) and Pontefract CC (adjacent to Pontefract Collieries FC), but by 2002 neither of these clubs were still in existence, leaving the town without its own club despite giving its name to the Pontefract and District Cricket League. Nowadays cricketers must travel to clubs in neighbouring towns and villages, with the closest being Hundhill Hall Cricket Club based in nearby [[East Hardwick]].\n\n==Transport==\nPontefract lies in close proximity to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and the [[M62 motorway|M62]].

The name \"Pontefract\" originates from the Latin for \"broken bridge\", formed of the elements pons ('bridge') and fractus ('broken'). Pontefract was not recorded in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'', but it was noted as Pontefracto in 1090, four years after the Domesday survey.<ref>Frank Barlow, William I and the Norman Conquest (London: The English Universities Press, 1965) p.95.

The Roman Ridge is believed to form part of an alternative route from Doncaster to York via Castleford and Tadcaster, as a diversion of the major Roman road [[Ermine Street]], which may have been used to avoid having to cross the [[Humber|River Humber]] near [[North Ferriby]] during rough weather conditions over the Humber.\n\n===Anglo-Scandinavian history===\n\nThe period of Yorkshire's history between the demise of the Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and the arrival of the Normans in 1068 is known as the Anglo-Scandinavian age.  The modern township of Pontefract consisted of two Anglo-Scandinavian settlements, known as Tanshelf and Kirkby.  In Yorkshire, place-name locations often contain the distinctive Danish '-by' i.e. Kirkby.  And even today, the major streets in Pontefract are designated by the Danish word 'gate' e.g. Bailygate.\n\n====Tanshelf and Kirkby====\n\nThe Anglo-Scandinavian township of Tanshelf recorded variously as ''Tateshale'', ''Tateshalla'', ''Tateshalle'' or ''Tatessella'' in the 1086 ''Domesday Book'' existed in the region that is today occupied by the town of Pontefract.  The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes its first reference to Tanshelf in the year 947 when King Eadred of England met with the ruling council of Northumbria to accept its submission. King Eadred did not enjoy Northumbria's support for long, and a year later the kingdom voted Eric Bloodaxe King of York.<ref>[http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/vikingweb/Settlement.htm Towns in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213053252/http://www.archaeology.wyjs.org.uk/VikingWeb/Settlement.htm |date=13 February 2015 }}. ''Settlements in Anglo-Saxon West Yorkshire''. Retrieved 30 August 2014.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Domesday Book]] was commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1086 Tanshelf was still a sizeable settlement for the period. The town had a priest, 60 petty burgesses, 16 cottagers, 16 villagers and 8 smallholders, amounting to a total of 101 people.  But the actual size of the population might be as much as four or five times larger than this as the people listed are landholders, and therefore the Doomsday Book does not take their families into account.  Tanshelf also had a church, a fishery and three mills.  Archaeologists have discovered the remains of the church on The Booths in Pontefract, off North Baileygate, below the castle. The oldest grave dates from around 690. The church is likely to be at Tanshelf and may have been similar to the church at [[Ledsham, West Yorkshire|Ledsham]].

The covered market is open all week, except Thursday afternoons and Sundays. Thursday afternoon is half-day closing in the town. The town is called 'Ponte'/'Ponty' by its citizens and sometimes jokingly referred to as Ponte Carlo, in reference to [[Monte Carlo]]. This theme is continued in the name of bars in the [[Xscape (building)|Xscape]] complex, [[Glasshoughton]] between Pontefract and [[Castleford]], referred to locally as 'Cas Vegas'. It is reported that Pontefract once held the British record for the town with the most pubs per square mile:{{by whom|date=April 2013}} indeed, numerous pubs still survive in the town centre in particular, for example Beastfair Vaults, the Liquorice Bush, the Red Lion, the Malt Shovel and the Blackmoor Head. A Wetherspoon public house opened on Horsefair in 2010.\n\nPontefract's deep, sandy soil makes it one of the few British places in which [[liquorice]] can successfully be grown.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The town has a liquorice-sweet industry; and the famous [[Pontefract cake]]s are produced, though the liquorice plant itself is no longer grown there. The town's two liquorice factories are owned by [[Haribo]] (formerly known as Dunhills) and Tangerine Confectionery (formerly part of the Cadbury's Group as Monkhill Confectionery, and before that Wilkinson's), respectively. A Liquorice Festival is held annually. [[Poet laureate]] [[Sir John Betjeman]] wrote a poem entitled \"The Licorice Fields at Pontefract\". In 2012 local farmer Robert Copley announced that he would be re-introducing a liquorice crop to Pontefract.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rebecca Smithers|date=30 July 2012|title=Liquorice to grow again in Pontefract|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/30/liquorice-pontefract|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=2015|title=The Home of Liquorice|url=http://www.farmercopleys.co.uk/the-home-of-liquorice/|work=Farmer Copleys|accessdate=27 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nClose by is the coal-fired [[Ferrybridge power station|power station]] at [[Ferrybridge]], although the local [[Coal mining|coal mines]] largely closed in the 1990s, contributing to high unemployment in the local area.

The secondary schools in the town are Carleton Community High School in Carleton, and the King's School on Mill Hill Lane, both for pupils aged 11\u201316. A sixth-form college, [[NEW College, Pontefract]], is located on Park Lane.\n\nThe old Pontefract General Infirmary on Southgate (pictured) was a general hospital; it is the place at which serial killer [[Harold Shipman]] began to murder his elderly patients. Beneath this building is an old [[Pontefract Hermitage|hermitage]], open to the public on certain days. [[Pontefract Museum]], from which the hermitage schedule can be obtained, is in the town centre, housed in the former [[Carnegie library]]. A new hospital was built on Friarwood and opened in 2010 with the new name of [[Pontefract Hospital]] and there is now a modern library building.\n\nNear to the hospital is Friarwood Valley Gardens, a rose garden, a sensory garden, a pinhole camera (formerly an aviary and earlier a Georgian gambling den), and an avenue of cherry trees. Friends of Friarwood Valley Gardens now work to improve it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nPontefract has three railway stations: [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]], on the [[Dearne Valley Line]], which connects [[York]] and [[Sheffield]]; and [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]] and [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]], which connects with [[Leeds]] and [[Wakefield]]. There are also rail services from Bradford to London that stop at [[Pontefract Monkhill]].\n\nThe local police force is West Yorkshire Police, with the town's neighbourhood policing team being situated at the new fire station on Stumpcross Lane. The original police station situated in Sessions House yard is due for closure since the new divisional headquarters for the Wakefield District opened in Normanton and the neighbouring magistrates' court has moved over to [[Leeds Magistrates Court|Leeds]] following the closure of the Wakefield and Pontefract courts..\n\nFire cover is provided by West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue with one pump (sometimes two) based at Pontefract Fire Station. Formerly located on Stuart Road in the town centre, the station has now moved to a new site at Stumpcross Lane, by the A645 road at the town's eastern edge. The new fire station also provides cover for Knottingley, that town's fire station having been closed as part of the merging of fire cover for Pontefract and Knottingley.\n\nThe Territorial Army, Army Cadets and Air Training Corps all have a presence within the town and are based at the historic [[Pontefract Barracks]] building on Wakefield Road. It now houses a Rifles Regiment Recruitment team.\n\nA house is said to be haunted by a poltergeist, nicknamed The Black Monk of Pontefract.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O68ayjhr3O8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=poltergeist&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSuL33j5_mAhWaRhUIHZSGDR0Q6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&q=poltergeist&f=false|title=Poltergeist: A Classic Study in Destructive Hauntings|last=Wilson|first=Colin|date=2010-11-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|year=|isbn=978-0-7387-2237-5|location=|pages=67, 152|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Media, arts and entertainment==\nThe local newspaper is the ''Pontefract and Castleford Express''. Pontefract is known for its 'down-to-earth' nightlife.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pontefract hotels|url=http://www.pontefracthotels.co.uk/}}</ref> Venues include The Red Lion, the Green Dragon, the Tap and Barrel, The Broken Bridge ([[Wetherspoons]]), the Malt Shovel, and the Ponty Tavern (formally The Blackmoor Head) or ''Blacky'' in local terms. In August 2012 one of Pontefract's oldest but most prestige nightclubs, Kiko's, re-opened its doors to the public after being closed since 2007, then closed again in 2013 due to the building being too far away from the town & other nightlife spots. Kiko's once hosted many notable performances back in the 1970s and 80s from notable bands such as The [[Bay City Rollers]]. As of Early 2020 the building is now vacant & severely damaged inside awaiting revival, venue change or demolition.\n\nNovelist [[Jack Vance]], in the \"[[Demon Princes]]\" cycle has named the capital of Aloysius, the main planet in the Vega system, after Pontefract. The hero of the series, Kirth Gersen, has his residence there.\n\n[[Ridings FM]] is the town's local commercial radio station, Launched in October 1999, [[Ridings FM]] can be heard across Pontefract on 106.8 FM. The station serves the wider [[Wakefield]] District. The station has a close relationship with the community and is actively involved in local charities' fundraising efforts.\n\n==Governance==\nFor local government purposes the town lies in the [[City of Wakefield]], coming under the governance of [[Wakefield Council]]. For this purpose it is divided into two electoral wards, Pontefract North and Pontefract South. Pontefract South is currently represented by three Labour councillors with North ward represented by three Labour councillors [as of September 2015].<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Councillors by Ward|url=http://mg.wakefield.gov.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW=LIST&PIC=0|publisher=Wakefield Council|accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref> South ward is a marginal ward, containing relatively affluent suburbs of Pontefract and outlying villages such as Darrington, combined with less wealthy areas such as Chequerfield, whilst North Ward includes parts of Monkhill, Ladybalk, Nevison and Myson Chair.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1997 the local ex-miner and former local [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]] branch leader [[Geoffrey Lofthouse, Baron Lofthouse of Pontefract|Geoff Lofthouse]] (18 December 1925&nbsp;\u2013 1 November 2012) was MP for the former constituency of Pontefract and Castleford. During this time he rose to the position of Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons. When the general election of 1997 was called he stood down to allow [[Yvette Cooper]] to be selected as the Labour Party candidate for that election. He was made a peer on 11 June 1997.\n\nYvette Cooper [[Member of Parliament|MP]], was elected MP for the [[Pontefract and Castleford (UK Parliament constituency)|Pontefract and Castleford constituency]] at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]. Cooper held a number of positions in the Labour governments up to 2010, followed by Shadow Cabinet roles (most notably [[Shadow Home Secretary]]) after the election of that year, but returned to the back benches following the [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|Labour leadership election of 2015]]. Pontefract and Castleford was merged with the [[Normanton (UK Parliament constituency)|Normanton constituency]] in a boundary change before the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nIn her maiden speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Cooper said:<blockquote>It is true that my constituency is plagued by unemployment, but I represent hard-working people who are proud of their strong communities and who have fought hard across generations to defend them. They are proud of their socialist traditions, and have fought for a better future for their children and their grandchildren. In the Middle Ages, that early egalitarian, the real [[Robin Hood]], lived, so we maintain, in the [[Wentbridge|Vale of Wentbridge]] to the south of Pontefract. It was a great base from which to hassle the travelling [[fat cat (term)|fat cat]]s on the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]].</blockquote>\n\nThe seat, which has a history of mining and industry, has consistently returned Labour MPs at [[general elections]]. [[Yvette Cooper]] polled 59.5% of the vote in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]].\n\n==Sports==\nThe town is home to many sports including cricket, football and squash. Prominent squash players [[Lee Beachill]] and [[James Willstrop]] both train at Pontefract Squash Centre. Notable institutions are horse racing at [[Pontefract Racecourse]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]], the area's professional rugby league club.\n\nPontefract Racecourse is the longest continuous horse racing circuit in Europe at {{convert|2|mi|125|yd|m furlong}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Course Details&nbsp;\u2013 Pontefract Racecourse|url=http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|accessdate=4 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821184541/http://www.pontefract-races.co.uk/course-details/|archivedate=21 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It stages flat racing between the end of March and the end of October. Pontefract swimming pool is on Stuart Road.\n\nPontefract has its own non-league football club, [[Pontefract Collieries F.C.]], which was founded in 1958 and plays adjacent to the former Prince of Wales Colliery off Beechnut Lane. The team, known locally as \"Ponte Colls\" play in the [[Northern Premier League]] Division One North West (correct as of the start of the 2019/20 season).\nPontefract is also home to the Pontefract Knights rugby league football club.\n\nPontefract RUFC is based at Moor Lane Carleton.  It runs three senior sides as well as a number of junior and girls teams.  Rugby Union has been played in the town since the 19th Century when Pontefract won the Yorkshire Cup.\n\nPontefract used to boast two cricket clubs, Lakeside CC (based in Pontefract Park) and Pontefract CC (adjacent to Pontefract Collieries FC), but by 2002 neither of these clubs were still in existence, leaving the town without its own club despite giving its name to the Pontefract and District Cricket League. Nowadays cricketers must travel to clubs in neighbouring towns and villages, with the closest being Hundhill Hall Cricket Club based in nearby [[East Hardwick]].\n\n==Transport==\nPontefract lies in close proximity to the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and the [[M62 motorway|M62]].  Bus transport is provided by [[Arriva Yorkshire]], the main hub in the town for this being [[Pontefract bus station]].  The town has direct rail connections with [[Leeds]], [[Wakefield]], [[Goole]], [[Castleford, West Yorkshire|Castleford]], [[York]] and [[Sheffield]] from the town's three railway stations; [[Pontefract Monkhill railway station|Pontefract Monkhill]], [[Pontefract Tanshelf railway station|Pontefract Tanshelf]] and [[Pontefract Baghill railway station|Pontefract Baghill]].

They are the largest ethnic group of Guinea-Bissau, representing more than one-quarter of the population. Despite their numbers, they have remained outside the colonial and postcolonial state because of their social organisation. The Balanta can be divided into four subgroups: Balanta Kentohe, Balanta Ganja, Balanta Mane, and Balanta Brassa, the largest of which are the Balanta Brassa.\n\nArchaeologists believe that the people who became the Balanta migrated to present-day Guinea-Bissau in small groups between the 10th and 14th centuries CE. Oral tradition amongst the Balanta has it that they migrated westward from the area that is now [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] to escape drought and wars. During the 19th century, they spread throughout the area that is now Guinea-Bissau and southern Senegal in order to resist the expansion of the [[Kaabu]] kingdom. Today, the Balanta are mostly found in the southern and central regions of Guinea-Bissau.\n\n==Culture==\n\nAll important decisions amongst the Balanta are taken by a Council of Elders. To become a member of the Council of Elders, the person has to be initiated during the Fanado ceremony. In general, egalitarianism prevails amongst the Balanta. Consequently, the Portuguese colonialists found it difficult to govern them.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Portugal mounted pacification campaigns against the resistant Balanta and subjected them to appointed [[Fulbe]] chiefs. Because of the Portuguese repression, the Balanta enlisted as soldiers in great numbers and were principal supporters of the [[PAIGC]] in the nationalist struggle for liberation during the 1960s and 1970s. Many Balanta resented their exclusion from the government; their prominence in the military spurred a series of Balanta-led coup attempts in the 1980s.<ref name=balante1>{{cite web|title=Culture Balanta |url=http://www.laaf.me/en/culture/balante.php |publisher=West African Languages and Cultures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414065301/http://www.laaf.me/en/culture/balante.php |archivedate=2015-04-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Balanta Fitness|url=http://www.demfellahz.com/balanta-fitness-history.html|publisher=Balanta Fitness}}</ref><ref name=balanta2>{{cite web|title=The Balanta People, Guinea Bissau, Africa|url=http://brown-humphrey.com/balanta_people/|publisher=Brown-Humphrey.com}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Balanta practice indigenous, spiritual customs and rites. In the Balanta society, God is believed to be far away, and communication with the Almighty is established  through their spiritual practices and traditions. Although Catholicism has been partially accepted, Islam is strong and practiced along with their unique spirit worship.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Music===\n\nThe Balanta play a gourd lute instrument called a kusunde. On the kusunde instrument, the short string is at the bottom rather than at the top, the top string was of middle length and the middle string is the longest although it was capoed by the middle length string and its open sounding length is therefore the same as that string. The tones produced by the instrument are in all: top string open F#, top string stopped G#, middle string open C#, middle string stopped D#, bottom drone string A#/B. The Balanta kusunde is similar to the [[Jola people|Jola]] [[akonting]]. The Balanta also play the balafon, which is composed of 24 layers instead of 12 or 14 found in the Mandingue community.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Marriage===\n\nIn ''People Like Me 2002: Face to Face!'', the Sunugal Ballet presented the Balanta wedding dance from the village of Mini-Ndame.  In this village, when the prince comes of age to marry, the kingdom has a big party, to which every family brings their daughters.  The young women compete with their beauty and their virtuosic dancing for the hand of the prince. The prince then chooses his bride, and a celebration ensues. To prove his courage to his future wife, a Balanta man must steal a cow.  The masks that are used in this dance include a large spirit mask laden with cowry shells, an old woman mask, a young girl mask, and a young man mask.  As symbols of family and spiritual connection, the masks play an important role when the community comes together to celebrate with music and dance.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Farming===\n\nThe Balanta are fishermen, herders, and cultivators.  They grow millet, rice, peanuts, cashews, and fruit for a cash crop.  Their specialty is the culture of cashew which they derive from the apple wine cashew called Cadjou.  The export to India of cashew nuts also provides an important economic force in the Balanta villages.  Raising cattle is also a traditional activity predominant as the sacrifice of the cattle is import in all stages of life (initiation, marriage, death, etc.)  The back of Guinea-Bissau's 50-peso note (No. 1) shows two farmers wielding an agricultural tool that is called a kebinde in the Balanta language (also called an arade in Guinean Creole).  These tools are used by the Balanta, Jola and Papel peoples to prepare the soil for planting crops \u2013 usually rice.  Use of the kebinde is an art that has been perfected over many years by the Balanta people who deservedly hold a reputation as expert farmers.  Along with intricate irrigation systems that mix salt and fresh water, they manage to maintain the nutrients in the soil and achieve excellent yields.  After the harvest, the Balanta people have a celebration called the Kussund\u00e9, where non-initiated men compete in dances.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Rites of passage===\n\nThe Balanta have initiation rites at various states of the individual's life.  Each phase of life, from childhood to adulthood, is regulated by an initiation that marks the entrance into a new social category.  From early childhood up to age 15, the child belongs to the category of Nwatch.  Around age 18 to 20 the individual enters the Fuur and then enters the Nghaye around age 25.  Around age 30, according to the rites of Kgness a man will be authorized to take a woman.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nAfter the young Balanta man has become a landowner and taken on family responsibilities, he can then be chosen by his maternal uncle to participate in the Fanado initiation.  Once chosen for the Fanado, a Balanta man cannot refuse the family's wishes.  The Fanado initiation ceremony takes place once every four years.  The Fanado is a two-month process in the \u201csacred woods\u201d which is the ultimate phase of initiation rites and social hierarchy.  Initiation during the Fanado ritual opens the doors of maturity and wisdom in the Balanta community.  Depicted on the back of the 50-peso note (No. 1) is a man in the costume worn by young Balanta men during the \u201cFanado\u201d or male circumcision ceremony.  Part of the costume is a tortoise shell that is hollowed out and worn on the back.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nThe first day of the Fanado ceremony is a general festival for the entire village during which people eat, drink and dance.  The initiates are presented to the village by their maternal uncles and greeted by the village.  After the presentation and greeting, the initiates are brought in the middle of a tropical forest to a place completely secret called the \u201csacred woods.\u201d  In the \u201csacred woods\u201d the initiates are circumcised by the \u201cmaster\u201d, a sort of magical figure-pedagogical.  After the first few days of circumcision, the initiates must build a kind of hut that will serve as their home-base for the next two months.  During these two months, the initiates only have contact with their uncles and the \u201cmaster\u201d.  The initiates undergo test of endurance and learn to be men.  What is imparted to the initiates during the Fanado not only concerns their entire culture, but also how to behave with others, how to manage the family, and how to live as adults and men therefore wise.  The tests and trials are hard to the point where some people face physical suffering, mutilation, and/or do not survive.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nOnce completed, the initiate is a mature man, capable of taking care of other people in the tribe.  After two months in the \u201csacred woods,\u201d the initiate (if survived) is ready to return to his family as a new man.  Nothing remains of the place where the rite was held, everything is burnt and jealously guarded in secret by those who took part.  Mothers learn of the fate of their children only on arrival to the village of the \u201cnew\u201d men.

They are the largest ethnic group of Guinea-Bissau, representing more than one-quarter of the population. Despite their numbers, they have remained outside the colonial and postcolonial state because of their social organisation. The Balanta can be divided into four subgroups: Balanta Kentohe, Balanta Ganja, Balanta Mane, and Balanta Brassa, the largest of which are the Balanta Brassa.\n\nArchaeologists believe that the people who became the Balanta migrated to present-day Guinea-Bissau in small groups between the 10th and 14th centuries CE. Oral tradition amongst the Balanta has it that they migrated westward from the area that is now [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]] to escape drought and wars. During the 19th century, they spread throughout the area that is now Guinea-Bissau and southern Senegal in order to resist the expansion of the [[Kaabu]] kingdom. Today, the Balanta are mostly found in the southern and central regions of Guinea-Bissau.\n\n==Culture==\n\nAll important decisions amongst the Balanta are taken by a Council of Elders. To become a member of the Council of Elders, the person has to be initiated during the Fanado ceremony. In general, egalitarianism prevails amongst the Balanta. Consequently, the Portuguese colonialists found it difficult to govern them.  In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Portugal mounted pacification campaigns against the resistant Balanta and subjected them to appointed [[Fulbe]] chiefs. Because of the Portuguese repression, the Balanta enlisted as soldiers in great numbers and were principal supporters of the [[PAIGC]] in the nationalist struggle for liberation during the 1960s and 1970s. Many Balanta resented their exclusion from the government; their prominence in the military spurred a series of Balanta-led coup attempts in the 1980s.<ref name=balante1>{{cite web|title=Culture Balanta |url=http://www.laaf.me/en/culture/balante.php |publisher=West African Languages and Cultures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414065301/http://www.laaf.me/en/culture/balante.php |archivedate=2015-04-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Balanta Fitness|url=http://www.demfellahz.com/balanta-fitness-history.html|publisher=Balanta Fitness}}</ref><ref name=balanta2>{{cite web|title=The Balanta People, Guinea Bissau, Africa|url=http://brown-humphrey.com/balanta_people/|publisher=Brown-Humphrey.com}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n\nThe Balanta practice indigenous, spiritual customs and rites. In the Balanta society, God is believed to be far away, and communication with the Almighty is established  through their spiritual practices and traditions. Although Catholicism has been partially accepted, Islam is strong and practiced along with their unique spirit worship.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Music===\n\nThe Balanta play a gourd lute instrument called a kusunde. On the kusunde instrument, the short string is at the bottom rather than at the top, the top string was of middle length and the middle string is the longest although it was capoed by the middle length string and its open sounding length is therefore the same as that string. The tones produced by the instrument are in all: top string open F#, top string stopped G#, middle string open C#, middle string stopped D#, bottom drone string A#/B. The Balanta kusunde is similar to the [[Jola people|Jola]] [[akonting]]. The Balanta also play the Balafon which is composed of 24 layers instead of 12 or 14 found in the Mandingue community.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Marriage===\n\nIn ''People Like Me 2002: Face to Face!'', the Sunugal Ballet presented the Balanta wedding dance from the village of Mini-Ndame.  In this village, when the prince comes of age to marry, the kingdom has a big party, to which every family brings their daughters.  The young women compete with their beauty and their virtuosic dancing for the hand of the prince. The prince then chooses his bride, and a celebration ensues. To prove his courage to his future wife, a Balanta man must steal a cow.  The masks that are used in this dance include a large spirit mask laden with cowry shells, an old woman mask, a young girl mask, and a young man mask.  As symbols of family and spiritual connection, the masks play an important role when the community comes together to celebrate with music and dance.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Farming===\n\nThe Balanta are fishermen, herders, and cultivators.  They grow millet, rice, peanuts, cashews, and fruit for a cash crop.  Their specialty is the culture of cashew which they derive from the apple wine cashew called Cadjou.  The export to India of cashew nuts also provides an important economic force in the Balanta villages.  Raising cattle is also a traditional activity predominant as the sacrifice of the cattle is import in all stages of life (initiation, marriage, death, etc.)  The back of Guinea-Bissau's 50-peso note (No. 1) shows two farmers wielding an agricultural tool that is called a kebinde in the Balanta language (also called an arade in Guinean Creole).  These tools are used by the Balanta, Jola and Papel peoples to prepare the soil for planting crops \u2013 usually rice.  Use of the kebinde is an art that has been perfected over many years by the Balanta people who deservedly hold a reputation as expert farmers.  Along with intricate irrigation systems that mix salt and fresh water, they manage to maintain the nutrients in the soil and achieve excellent yields.  After the harvest, the Balanta people have a celebration called the Kussund\u00e9, where non-initiated men compete in dances.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n===Rites of passage===\n\nThe Balanta have initiation rites at various states of the individual's life.  Each phase of life, from childhood to adulthood, is regulated by an initiation that marks the entrance into a new social category.  From early childhood up to age 15, the child belongs to the category of Nwatch.  Around age 18 to 20 the individual enters the Fuur and then enters the Nghaye around age 25.  Around age 30, according to the rites of Kgness a man will be authorized to take a woman.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nAfter the young Balanta man has become a landowner and taken on family responsibilities, he can then be chosen by his maternal uncle to participate in the Fanado initiation.  Once chosen for the Fanado, a Balanta man cannot refuse the family's wishes.  The Fanado initiation ceremony takes place once every four years.  The Fanado is a two-month process in the \u201csacred woods\u201d which is the ultimate phase of initiation rites and social hierarchy.  Initiation during the Fanado ritual opens the doors of maturity and wisdom in the Balanta community.  Depicted on the back of the 50-peso note (No. 1) is a man in the costume worn by young Balanta men during the \u201cFanado\u201d or male circumcision ceremony.  Part of the costume is a tortoise shell that is hollowed out and worn on the back.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nThe first day of the Fanado ceremony is a general festival for the entire village during which people eat, drink and dance.  The initiates are presented to the village by their maternal uncles and greeted by the village.  After the presentation and greeting, the initiates are brought in the middle of a tropical forest to a place completely secret called the \u201csacred woods.\u201d  In the \u201csacred woods\u201d the initiates are circumcised by the \u201cmaster\u201d, a sort of magical figure-pedagogical.  After the first few days of circumcision, the initiates must build a kind of hut that will serve as their home-base for the next two months.  During these two months, the initiates only have contact with their uncles and the \u201cmaster\u201d.  The initiates undergo test of endurance and learn to be men.  What is imparted to the initiates during the Fanado not only concerns their entire culture, but also how to behave with others, how to manage the family, and how to live as adults and men therefore wise.  The tests and trials are hard to the point where some people face physical suffering, mutilation, and/or do not survive.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\nOnce completed, the initiate is a mature man, capable of taking care of other people in the tribe.  After two months in the \u201csacred woods,\u201d the initiate (if survived) is ready to return to his family as a new man.  Nothing remains of the place where the rite was held, everything is burnt and jealously guarded in secret by those who took part.  Mothers learn of the fate of their children only on arrival to the village of the \u201cnew\u201d men.   The most valiant initiates that do survive emerge from the \u201csacred woods\u201d to songs of their bravery by family and friends.  The initiate then wears a bright red hat to show that he has become Lante Ndang (brave and wise), and the following day he will be allowed to serve on the council of elders who manages village life.  The ex-president of Guinea-Bissau [[Kumba Yalla]] is a member of the Balanta people and was often seen wearing a red hat as a sign that he had completed the Fanado initiation.<ref name=balante1/><ref name=balanta2/>\n\n==Notable People==\n\n*[[Charlamagne Tha God]], radio personality, host of The Breakfast Club.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDahVuWGV6M Balanta Language]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UOBVsk47d0 Balanta Dance]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2hejla_V7E Balanta Music]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in the Gambia}}\n{{Ethnic groups in Guinea-Bissau}}\n{{Ethnic groups in Senegal}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Guinea-Bissau]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Senegal]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Gambia]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities in Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Jessicapierce", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed extraneous markup, minor copy edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanta_people"}

The following year, former Ireland striker [[Eamon O'Keefe]] arrived as manager, delivering the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]], and the [[League of Ireland Cup]] (the club's first national silverware).\n\nBy 1988, O'Mahony was re-installed as manager, and the side finished eighth in the league, and a loss to champions [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[FAI Cup]] final earned the club its first European ticket. While [[Torpedo Moscow]] knocked the club out of the [[1989\u201390 European Cup Winners' Cup]], City earned a fifth-place finish in the Premier Division, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was reclaimed.\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s saw lengthy unbeaten league runs, high league positions, retention of the Munster Senior Cup through four years, and a number of games in European competition. The most notable European game was a [[UEFA Cup]] tie with [[Bayern Munich]], which saw City hold the Germans 1:1 at [[Musgrave Park, Cork|Musgrave Park]] before falling 0:2 to late goals in Bavaria. 1993 saw Cork City land the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] title for the first time, after a [[1993 League of Ireland Championship Play-offs|complicated three team play-off]]. O'Mahoney resigned and the club moved to a [[Bishopstown Stadium|new stadium in Bishopstown]] at the end of the season.\n\n[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]] took the helm and the 1993/94 season began with City coming from three goals down to beat Welsh side [[Cwmbran Town F.C.|Cwmbran Town]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the following round they suffered odd-goal defeats both home and away to Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]. City finished in runners-up position in the league that year.\n\n1994/95 was a varied season for Cork City. After a strong start to the season, financial pressures forced Richardson to resign and with Bishopstown not being developed to plan, games were switched to [[Cobh]], [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], and an enforced trip to [[Tolka Park]]. [[Noel O'Mahony]] was re-appointed as manager but the title challenge collapsed. The club did have successes in the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] and [[League of Ireland Cup]] that season however.\n\n[[File:Turners.cross.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City returned to [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] in 1996]]\nAt the start of the 1995/96 season [[Rob Hindmarch]] took the reins, but the club was in trouble. With the stadium dragging it under, the receiver was called in and the club left 'homeless'. Efforts to save the situation saw a new board installed and a move back to Turners Cross. With limited funds, Hindmarch had skimmed along but relegation still threatened, and a Cup exit saw [[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]] appointed. The team managed a ninth-place finish in the league, and for the first time in five years City lost the Munster Cup \u2013 to Waterford junior side [[Waterford Crystal F.C.|Waterford Crystal]].\n\n1996/97 saw City finish in fourth place. The club also narrowly lost out in the League Cup with an unexpected loss to First Division [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. Crowds began to increase, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was recaptured. The following season Cork performed well in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|InterToto Cup]] and the team improved to third in the league. Dave Barry's reign reached its high point in that year, when City won the 1998 FAI Cup. Cork began the following season with eight straight wins but in the end had to settle for second place, as three defeats to champions [[St Patrick's Athletic]] were costly. After finishing runner up for the second season in a row in 1999/2000, Barry resigned to be replaced by [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]].\n\n===2000s===\nColin Murphy stayed for one [[FAI Super Cup]] game before departing to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] just days before a [[UEFA Cup]] game. His replacement, [[Derek Mountfield]], lasted less than a season and was replaced by former player Liam Murphy. Under Murphy, City embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run that brought an [[Intertoto]] ticket and a tenth Munster Cup success.\n\nIn 2001, a controversial link-up was proposed between City, English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and local outfit Mayfield United. Fans protested however, and the link-up never materialised. Also in 2001, the board of directors stepped down and businessman [[Brian Lennox]] assumed control and lead the club to a [[History of football (soccer)#From amateurism to professionalism|professional era]].\n\n2002 was most notable as a time of transition, as several older players, who had been a mainstay of the team in the 1990s, left the club or joined the coach staff. They were replaced by younger signings \u2013 such as [[George O'Callaghan]], [[John O'Flynn]] and [[Dan Murray (English footballer)|Dan Murray]].\n\nIn February 2003 ex-[[St. Patrick's Athletic|St. Pat's]] manager [[Pat Dolan]] was unveiled as the new boss and he led City to third place in the new summer season. Dolan's second season as manager also proved successful, as City surpassed [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] and [[NEC Nijmegen]] in the Intertoto Cup and secured second place in the league.\n\nDolan was controversially sacked in pre-season 2005 and replaced by former manager Damien Richardson. In 2005, Richardson lead Cork City to their second league championship \u2013 winning on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 victory over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]]. In the same year, Cork City finished runners-up the [[FAI Cup]].\n\n[[Image:City-belgrade.jpg|thumb|right|UEFA Champions League qualifier- Cork City v Crvena Zvezda]]\n2006 saw further upgrade work begin at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] and City met [[Apollon Limassol]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The club lost to Drogheda United in the Setanta Cup Final, finished 4th in the league, and secured a place in the Intertoto and Setanta Cup.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, two new signings [[FIFA Two|were deemed ineligible for play]]. This mirrored an inconsistent season start, with elimination from the Setanta Cup, a home win against St. Pat's and a record-equalling 4\u20131 defeat to [[Sligo Rovers]]. In August 2007, [[Roy O'Donovan]] left for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a record [[League of Ireland|LOI]] fee of \u20ac500,000. 2007 also saw the club's ownership change hands: from chairman Brian Lennox to venture capital firm \"Arkaga\". Despite an [[FAI Cup]] win, manager Damien Richardson's future at the club was in doubt, and \u2013 after some acrimony \u2013 he and the club parted ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 |title=Richardson and Cork agree exit deal |date=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045856/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, former [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] became manager,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |title=Mathews confirmed as new Cork manager |date=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517051335/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> and the club signed several players \u2013 including taking advantage of FIFA's changes to the \"3 club\" rule by re-signing [[George O'Callaghan]] from [[Ipswich Town]]. However O'Callaghan was later dropped and released. City were knocked out of the first qualifying round in European competition by [[FC Haka]]. While David Mooney retained the league's top scorer spot, City failed to take points from Bohemians or St. Pats and finished fifth in the league. The club did however gain some silverware, beating [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] in the [[Setanta Sports Cup 2008|Setanta Sports Cup final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/1101/setantacup.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |title=Cork City 2\u20131 Glentoran |date=1 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602203852/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/1101/setantacup.html |archivedate= 2 June 2009 }}</ref> Off the pitch the club suffered a considerable threat when, in August 2008, after investment difficulties with venture capital firm Arkaga,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/08/18/story70090.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712035004/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/08/18/story70090.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 July 2012 |publisher=Irish Examiner |title=Arkaga defends its role at Cork City |date=18 August 2008 }}</ref> the club entered into [[examinership]].

Since the club's inception in 1984, the kits also featured a red trim \u2013 influenced in part by the traditional [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] colours of [[Cork GAA|County Cork]]. Over the years, these base colours were worn in different combinations:<ref name=\"kits\">{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcitykits.com/kitsindex.html | publisher = CorkCityKits.com | title = Cork City Kits - Kit Index |accessdate = 15 November 2017 }}</ref> originally green and white hoops in 1984, then white shirts with green and red trim in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif | publisher = CorkCityFC.ie | title = Kits image | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616140909/http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif |archivedate=16 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the club broke with tradition to use a red and white kit \u2013 similar to the Cork County GAA kits. Subsequently, the club reverted to the green and white theme in 2002, initially with white sidings rather than stripes, but eventually returning to green white and red stripes.<ref name=\"kits\"/>\n\nFrom 1984 to 2004, the team never wore a kit with a single solid colour.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, in 2004, when playing [[Intertoto]] cup opponents [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC Nijmegen]], the referee deemed that both of Cork City's kits clashed with both of NEC's kits. The club was forced to hurriedly source an alternative while en route to the [[Netherlands]]. The team wore all-white kits with a makeshift crest and sponsorship.\n\nThere was a recurring theme of black away kits \u2013 often with yellow trim \u2013 reflecting the kits of former Cork clubs.<ref name=\"kits\"/> In 2004, a Cork XI selection featuring a number of City players faced [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], wearing yellow and black. Black again became the colour of the team's away jersey in 2008, with a jersey from Danish maker [[Hummel International|Hummel]].\n\nIn 2010, the club kept with tradition by wearing a green home kit with red and white trim manufactured by Hummel. The away kit was red with white trim, similar to the 1997\u20132001 home kits, and Cork GAA kits. These kits were used for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. City wore red at home for the first time since the 2001/02 season on 10 September 2010 against Mervue United to show support for the Cork Gaelic Footballers who were due to face Down in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final the following weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/2010/09/08/city-to-wear-red-on-friday/|title=corkcityfc.net: City to Wear Red on Friday |date=8 September 2010|work=airtricityleague.com|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the club announced [[Umbro]] Ireland as the club's official kit partner.<ref>{{cite web |last=Release |first=Press |url=http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |title=Cork City sign Umbro kit deal - Extratime.ie - League of Ireland ! |publisher=Wnl.ie |accessdate=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101233/http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |archivedate=16 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, the club's official kit partner was [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], with gear provided by Teamwear Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u00c9anna Buckley |url=http://www.corkcityfc.ie/home/2014/09/30/kit-deal-agreed-with-teamwear-ireland/ |title=Kit Deal Agreed with Teamwear Ireland - Cork City Football Club |publisher=Corkcityfc.ie |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> In September 2017 it was announced that Cork City had signed a three-year deal with kit supplier Adidas starting from the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-will-be-back-in-adidas-kit-for-the-2018-season-3593836-Sep2017/ | publisher = The42.ie | title = Cork City FC will be back in adidas kits for the 2018 season | date = 12 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n[[File:Turners Cross Stadium Shed End Cork City v Dundalk 24 April 2015 1.JPG|thumb|Colour from \"shed-end\" supporters ahead of a near-capacity game in April 2015<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-dundalk-turners-cross-fans-2069310-Apr2015/ |date=25 April 2015 |title=Cork City apologise to fans who were locked out of Turner's Cross |publisher= TheJournal.ie }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cork City decoration.jpg|thumb|upright|Graphic of a Cork City shirt decorating a bar on [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] ]]\nCork City have one of the biggest support bases in the [[League of Ireland]], and for example in early 2017 had average attendances of between four and five thousand per home game, compared to a league average of approximately 1,500.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/articles/18756/league-of-ireland-attendances-2017---gameweek-1-8/ | publisher = ExtraTime.ie | title = League of Ireland Attendances 2017 - Gameweek 1-8 | date= 15 April 2017 }}</ref> The club had an average attendance of 4,453 during the 2015 season, the highest in Ireland, and approximately 1,000 higher than the next highest averages.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/14143/2015-league-of-ireland-attendances---the-story-so-far/ | publisher =\n ExtraTime.ie | title = 2015 League of Ireland Attendances - The Story so far | date= 27 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Shed\" is a section of seating in the Curragh Road stand which is home to Cork City's more vocal supporters.

Founded by officials from several Cork clubs (including [[Cork United F.C. (1979\u20131982)|Cork United]] and [[Avondale United F.C. (Cork)|Avondale United]]), the new club was elected to the [[League of Ireland]]. [[Bobby Tambling]] was the first manager appointed to the club, but he was replaced by Tony 'Tucker' Allen after only 13 games.\n\nIn its first and second seasons, the young club barely averted relegation to the new First Division \u2013 failing to win a single game at home in [[Flower Lodge]] and avoiding relegation only on goal difference. The club reached the semi-finals of the FAI Cup, but were knocked-out by [[Shamrock Rovers]] \u2013 in the last match played at the Lodge.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\"\n|-\n|<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:250 height:860\nPlotArea   = width:50 height:840 left:50 bottom:10\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod     = from:1984 till:2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1984\n\n# there is no automatic collision detection,\n# so shift texts up or down manually to avoid overlap\n\nDefine $dx = 25 # shift text to right side of bar\nDefine $dy = -5\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Leaders color:green width:25 mark:(line,white) align:left fontsize:S\n\n  from:1984 till:1984 shift:($dx) text:[[Bobby Tambling]]\n  from:1984  till:1986 shift:($dx) text:[[Tony Allen (footballer)|Tony Allen]]\n  from:1986 till:1987 shift:($dx) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]\n  from:1987  till:1988 shift:($dx) text:[[Eamonn O\u2019Keefe]]\n  from:1988 till:1992 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~FAI League Cup Winners 1988~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1989~UEFA Cup 1991~League of Ireland Champions 1992\n  from:1992  till:1993 shift:($dx) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~UEFA European Cup 1993\n  from:1993  till:1994 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Noel O'Mahony]]~UEFA Cup 1994~FAI League Cup 1994\n  from:1994  till:1995 shift:($dx) text:[[Rob Hindmarch]]\n  from:1995  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 1997~FAI Cup 1998~FAI League Cup 1998~UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1998~UEFA Cup 1999\n  from:2000  till:2000 shift:($dx) text:[[Derek Mountfield]]~[[Colin Murphy]]\n  from:2000  till:2003 shift:($dx) text:[[Liam Murphy (football)|Liam Murphy]]~UEFA Cup 2000~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2001\n  from:2003  till:2005 shift:($dx) text:[[Pat Dolan]]~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2004\n  from:2005  till:2008 shift:($dx,10) text:[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]]~League of Ireland Champions 2005~UEFA Cup 2005~UEFA Champions' League 2006~UEFA Intertoto Cup 2007~FAI Ford Cup 2007\n  from:2008  till:2009 shift:($dx) text:[[Alan Mathews]]~Setanta Sports Cup 2008\n  from:2009  till:2010 shift:($dx) text:[[Paul Doolin]]\n  from:2010  till:2013 shift:($dx) text:[[Tommy Dunne (footballer born 1972)|Tommy Dunne]]~LOI First Division 2011\n  from:2013  till:2019 shift:($dx,40) text:[[John Caulfield (Irish footballer)|John Caulfield]]~UEFA Europa League 2015~President's Cup 2016~UEFA Europa League 2016~FAI Cup 2016~President's Cup 2017~UEFA Europa League 2017~League of Ireland Champions 2017~FAI Cup 2017~President's Cup 2018\n  from:2019  till:2019 shift:($dx,-5) text:[[Neale Fenn]]</timeline>\n|}\n\nIn 1986 the club moved to a new home at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], where new manager [[Noel O'Mahony]] brought Cork to a midtable finish. The following year, former Ireland striker [[Eamon O'Keefe]] arrived as manager, delivering the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]], and the [[League of Ireland Cup]] (the club's first national silverware).\n\nBy 1988, O'Mahony was re-installed as manager, and the side finished eighth in the league, and a loss to champions [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] in the [[FAI Cup]] final earned the club its first European ticket. While [[Torpedo Moscow]] knocked the club out of the [[1989\u201390 European Cup Winners' Cup]], City earned a fifth-place finish in the Premier Division, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was reclaimed.\n\n===1990s===\nThe early 1990s saw lengthy unbeaten league runs, high league positions, retention of the Munster Senior Cup through four years, and a number of games in European competition. The most notable European game was a [[UEFA Cup]] tie with [[Bayern Munich]], which saw City hold the Germans 1:1 at [[Musgrave Park, Cork|Musgrave Park]] before falling 0:2 to late goals in Bavaria. 1993 saw Cork City land the [[League of Ireland Premier Division]] title for the first time, after a [[1993 League of Ireland Championship Play-offs|complicated three team play-off]]. O'Mahoney resigned and the club moved to a [[Bishopstown Stadium|new stadium in Bishopstown]] at the end of the season.\n\n[[Damien Richardson (footballer)|Damien Richardson]] took the helm and the 1993/94 season began with City coming from three goals down to beat Welsh side [[Cwmbran Town F.C.|Cwmbran Town]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the following round they suffered odd-goal defeats both home and away to Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]. City finished in runners-up position in the league that year.\n\n1994/95 was a varied season for Cork City. After a strong start to the season, financial pressures forced Richardson to resign and with Bishopstown not being developed to plan, games were switched to [[Cobh]], [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]], and an enforced trip to [[Tolka Park]]. [[Noel O'Mahony]] was re-appointed as manager but the title challenge collapsed. The club did have successes in the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] and [[League of Ireland Cup]] that season however.\n\n[[File:Turners.cross.jpg|thumb|left|Cork City returned to [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] in 1996]]\nAt the start of the 1995/96 season [[Rob Hindmarch]] took the reins, but the club was in trouble. With the stadium dragging it under, the receiver was called in and the club left 'homeless'. Efforts to save the situation saw a new board installed and a move back to Turners Cross. With limited funds, Hindmarch had skimmed along but relegation still threatened, and a Cup exit saw [[Dave Barry (Irish footballer)|Dave Barry]] appointed. The team managed a ninth-place finish in the league, and for the first time in five years City lost the Munster Cup \u2013 to Waterford junior side [[Waterford Crystal F.C.|Waterford Crystal]].\n\n1996/97 saw City finish in fourth place. The club also narrowly lost out in the League Cup with an unexpected loss to First Division [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. Crowds began to increase, and the [[Munster Senior Cup (association football)|Munster Senior Cup]] was recaptured. The following season Cork performed well in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|InterToto Cup]] and the team improved to third in the league. Dave Barry's reign reached its high point in that year, when City won the 1998 FAI Cup. Cork began the following season with eight straight wins but in the end had to settle for second place, as three defeats to champions [[St Patrick's Athletic]] were costly. After finishing runner up for the second season in a row in 1999/2000, Barry resigned to be replaced by [[Colin Murphy (footballer born 1950)|Colin Murphy]].\n\n===2000s===\nColin Murphy stayed for one [[FAI Super Cup]] game before departing to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] just days before a [[UEFA Cup]] game. His replacement, [[Derek Mountfield]], lasted less than a season and was replaced by former player Liam Murphy. Under Murphy, City embarked on a 13-game unbeaten run that brought an [[Intertoto]] ticket and a tenth Munster Cup success.\n\nIn 2001, a controversial link-up was proposed between City, English side [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and local outfit Mayfield United. Fans protested however, and the link-up never materialised. Also in 2001, the board of directors stepped down and businessman [[Brian Lennox]] assumed control and lead the club to a [[History of football (soccer)#From amateurism to professionalism|professional era]].\n\n2002 was most notable as a time of transition, as several older players, who had been a mainstay of the team in the 1990s, left the club or joined the coach staff. They were replaced by younger signings \u2013 such as [[George O'Callaghan]], [[John O'Flynn]] and [[Dan Murray (English footballer)|Dan Murray]].\n\nIn February 2003 ex-[[St. Patrick's Athletic|St. Pat's]] manager [[Pat Dolan]] was unveiled as the new boss and he led City to third place in the new summer season. Dolan's second season as manager also proved successful, as City surpassed [[Malm\u00f6 FF]] and [[NEC Nijmegen]] in the Intertoto Cup and secured second place in the league.\n\nDolan was controversially sacked in pre-season 2005 and replaced by former manager Damien Richardson. In 2005, Richardson lead Cork City to their second league championship \u2013 winning on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 victory over [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]]. In the same year, Cork City finished runners-up the [[FAI Cup]].\n\n[[Image:City-belgrade.jpg|thumb|right|UEFA Champions League qualifier- Cork City v Crvena Zvezda]]\n2006 saw further upgrade work begin at [[Turners Cross (stadium)|Turners Cross]] and City met [[Apollon Limassol]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. The club lost to Drogheda United in the Setanta Cup Final, finished 4th in the league, and secured a place in the Intertoto and Setanta Cup.\n\nAt the start of the 2007 season, two new signings [[FIFA Two|were deemed ineligible for play]]. This mirrored an inconsistent season start, with elimination from the Setanta Cup, a home win against St. Pat's and a record-equalling 4\u20131 defeat to [[Sligo Rovers]]. In August 2007, [[Roy O'Donovan]] left for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for a record [[League of Ireland|LOI]] fee of \u20ac500,000. 2007 also saw the club's ownership change hands: from chairman Brian Lennox to venture capital firm \"Arkaga\". Despite an [[FAI Cup]] win, manager Damien Richardson's future at the club was in doubt, and \u2013 after some acrimony \u2013 he and the club parted ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 |title=Richardson and Cork agree exit deal |date=20 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223045856/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2007/1220/corkcity.html |archivedate=23 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, former [[Longford Town FC|Longford Town]] boss [[Alan Mathews]] became manager,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |publisher=RT\u00c9 Sport |title=Mathews confirmed as new Cork manager |date=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517051335/http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0115/corkcity.html |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> and the club signed several players \u2013 including taking advantage of FIFA's changes to the \"3 club\" rule by re-signing [[George O'Callaghan]] from [[Ipswich Town]].

Since the club's inception in 1984, the kits also featured a red trim \u2013 influenced in part by the traditional [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] colours of [[Cork GAA|County Cork]]. Over the years, these base colours were worn in different combinations:<ref name=\"kits\">{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcitykits.com/kitsindex.html | publisher = CorkCityKits.com | title = Cork City Kits - Kit Index |accessdate = 15 November 2017 }}</ref> originally green and white hoops in 1984, then white shirts with green and red trim in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif | publisher = CorkCityFC.ie | title = Kits image | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616140909/http://www.corkcityfc.ie/images/kits.gif |archivedate=16 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the club broke with tradition to use a red and white kit \u2013 similar to the Cork County GAA kits. Subsequently, the club reverted to the green and white theme in 2002, initially with white sidings rather than stripes, but eventually returning to green white and red stripes.<ref name=\"kits\"/>\n\nFrom 1984 to 2004, the team never wore a kit with a single solid colour.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} However, in 2004, when playing [[Intertoto]] cup opponents [[N.E.C. (football club)|NEC Nijmegen]], the referee deemed that both of Cork City's kits clashed with both of NEC's kits. The club was forced to hurriedly source an alternative while en route to the [[Netherlands]]. The team wore all-white kits with a makeshift crest and sponsorship.\n\nThere was a recurring theme of black away kits \u2013 often with yellow trim \u2013 reflecting the kits of former Cork clubs.<ref name=\"kits\"/> In 2004, a Cork XI selection featuring a number of City players faced [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], wearing yellow and black. Black again became the colour of the team's away jersey in 2008, with a jersey from Danish maker [[Hummel International|Hummel]].\n\nIn 2010, the club kept with tradition by wearing a green home kit with red and white trim manufactured by Hummel. The away kit was red with white trim, similar to the 1997\u20132001 home kits, and Cork GAA kits. These kits were used for the 2010 and 2011 seasons. City wore red at home for the first time since the 2001/02 season on 10 September 2010 against Mervue United to show support for the Cork Gaelic Footballers who were due to face Down in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final the following weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcityfc.net/home/2010/09/08/city-to-wear-red-on-friday/|title=corkcityfc.net: City to Wear Red on Friday |date=8 September 2010|work=airtricityleague.com|accessdate=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the club announced [[Umbro]] Ireland as the club's official kit partner.<ref>{{cite web |last=Release |first=Press |url=http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |title=Cork City sign Umbro kit deal - Extratime.ie - League of Ireland ! |publisher=Wnl.ie |accessdate=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116101233/http://www.wnl.ie/newsdesk/articles/7012/cork-city-sign-umbro-kit-deal/ |archivedate=16 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons, the club's official kit partner was [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], with gear provided by Teamwear Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|author=\u00c9anna Buckley |url=http://www.corkcityfc.ie/home/2014/09/30/kit-deal-agreed-with-teamwear-ireland/ |title=Kit Deal Agreed with Teamwear Ireland - Cork City Football Club |publisher=Corkcityfc.ie |date= |accessdate=15 November 2016}}</ref> In September 2017 it was announced that Cork City had signed a three-year deal with kit supplier Adidas starting from the 2018 season.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-will-be-back-in-adidas-kit-for-the-2018-season-3593836-Sep2017/ | publisher = The42.ie | title = Cork City FC will be back in adidas kits for the 2018 season | date = 12 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n[[File:Turners Cross Stadium Shed End Cork City v Dundalk 24 April 2015 1.JPG|thumb|Colour from \"shed-end\" supporters ahead of a near-capacity game in April 2015<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.the42.ie/cork-city-dundalk-turners-cross-fans-2069310-Apr2015/ |date=25 April 2015 |title=Cork City apologise to fans who were locked out of Turner's Cross |publisher= TheJournal.ie }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Cork City decoration.jpg|thumb|upright|Graphic of a Cork City shirt decorating a bar on [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] ]]\nCork City have one of the biggest support bases in the [[League of Ireland]], and for example in early 2017 had average attendances of between four and five thousand per home game, compared to a league average of approximately 1,500.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/articles/18756/league-of-ireland-attendances-2017---gameweek-1-8/ | publisher = ExtraTime.ie | title = League of Ireland Attendances 2017 - Gameweek 1-8 | date= 15 April 2017 }}</ref> The club had an average attendance of 4,453 during the 2015 season, the highest in Ireland, and approximately 1,000 higher than the next highest averages.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/14143/2015-league-of-ireland-attendances---the-story-so-far/ | publisher =\n ExtraTime.ie | title = 2015 League of Ireland Attendances - The Story so far | date= 27 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\n\"The Shed\" is a section of seating in the Curragh Road stand which is home to Cork City's more vocal supporters.

The team play in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]].  Nicknamed \"the Tykes\", they were founded in 1887 by [[Tiverton Preedy|Reverend Tiverton Preedy]] under the name '''Barnsley St. Peter's'''. The club's colours were originally blue, but were converted to red and white in 1904 and Barnsley have played in those colours ever since. Their home ground since 1888 has been [[Oakwell]].\n\nBarnsley won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1911\u201312 FA Cup|1911\u201312]] and were also runners-up in [[1909\u201310 FA Cup|1909\u201310]]. The club won two trophies at [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2016 \u2013 the [[Football League Trophy]], beating [[Oxford United]] 3\u20132 in the [[2016 Football League Trophy Final|final]], and the [[2016 Football League play-offs]], beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 3\u20131 in the [[2016 Football League One play-off Final|final]]. Barnsley became only the second club to secure both the [[Football League Trophy (and predecessors)|Football League Trophy]] and [[The Football League|Football League]] promotion via playoff finals in the same season, after [[Grimsby Town F.C.]].\n\nOn 19 December 2017, it was announced that Patrick Cryne and family had agreed to sell a majority stake in [[Barnsley Football Club]] to a consortium involving [[Chien Lee]] of NewCity Capital, Grace Hung and Paul Conway of Pacific Media Group, Indian businessman Neerav Parekh and baseball legend [[Billy Beane]]. The new consortium holds 80% of the shares and the Cryne family holds 20% of the shares of Barnsley Football club.<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/club-statement/ Club Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220037/https://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/club-statement/ |date=23 December 2017 }} Barnsley F.C.

One example is [[Tommy Taylor]], who was a prolific goalscorer for Barnsley in the early 1950s and went on to win two league titles with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (as well as scoring 16 times in 19 England internationals) before losing his life in the [[Munich air disaster]]. Taylor's move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was for a fee of \u00a329,999 \u2013 one of the highest fees in England at the time. Taylor broke into the Barnsley team just after the sale of wing-half [[Danny Blanchflower]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Blanchflower would go on to sign for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and be voted [[FWA Player of the Year]] twice as well as captaining the [[North London]] club to the first [[double (association football)|league and cup double]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sports-columnists/Tommy-Taylor--Gone-but.3662813.jp |title=Tommy Taylor&nbsp;\u2013 Gone but still not forgotten|newspaper=Yorkshire Post Online|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginnings and FA Cup glory ===\nBarnsley FC was established in 1887 by a [[clergy]]man, [[Tiverton Preedy]], and played in the Sheffield and District League from 1890 and then in the [[Midland League (1889)|Midland League]] from 1895. They joined [[the Football League]] in 1898, and struggled in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first decade, due in part to ongoing financial difficulties. In 1910 the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final, where they lost out to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in a replay match. However, they would then reach the [[1912 FA Cup Final]] where they would defeat [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 1\u20130 in a replay to win the trophy for the first and only time in their history.\nWhen the league restarted after [[World War I]], the 1919\u201320 season brought some significant changes to the league. The principal difference was that the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] would be increased from 20 teams to 22. The bottom team from the previous season was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and they were duly relegated. The first extra place in the First Division went to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who retained their place despite finishing 2nd bottom and therefore in the relegation places. [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] were rightly promoted from the Second Division which left one place to be filled. Having finished the previous season's Second Division in 3rd place (1914\u201315), Barnsley expected to achieve First Division status for the first time, but The Football League instead chose to call a ballot of the clubs. Henry Norris, the then [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] chairman, had recently moved [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] north of the [[River Thames]] to [[Highbury]], and needed First Division football to attract fans to their new home. He was later to admit some underhand dealings, allegedly including the bribing of some member clubs to vote for Arsenal's inclusion. They duly won the vote and Barnsley were consigned to the second tier of English football for another 8 decades.\n\n=== Pre-war and post-war era ===\nThe club did however come close to reaching the top division in the early years. In 1922, they missed out on promotion by a single goal. During the years preceding and following [[World War II]], the club found themselves sliding between the [[Football League Second Division|Second]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\nIn 1949 the club signed a 23-year-old wing-half called [[Danny Blanchflower]] from [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]], and he so impressed at Oakwell that two years later he was signed by [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], later signing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and being voted [[FWA Player of the Year]] twice, as well as being the captain of the 20th century's first league and cup double winning team in 1961.\n\nAround the time of Blanchflower's departure, a young centre-forward called [[Tommy Taylor]] broke into the Barnsley team, scoring 26 goals in 44 games for Barnsley. In April 1953, he became one of the most expensive players in English football at the time when [[Matt Busby]] signed him for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for a fee of \u00a329,999. Taylor went on to be a prolific goalscorer at the highest level over the next five years, winning two league titles alongside Brian Montgomery  and also scoring 16 times in 19 appearances for the [[England national football team]], before losing his life in the [[Munich air disaster]] in February 1958.\n\n=== Fourth Division era ===\nWhen the Northern and Southern sections of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] were replaced by national [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Divisions]] for the [[1958-59 in English football|1958\u201359 season]], Barnsley were still in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], but went down to the Third Division at the end of that season.\n\nIn 1965, Barnsley were relegated to the Football League Fourth Division for the first time, winning promotion three years later. They went down to the Fourth Division again in 1972, and this time stayed down for seven seasons, finally returning to the Third Division in 1979.\n\n=== Revival in the 1980s ===\nTwo years later, they went up again and quickly established themselves as a decent [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side throughout the 1980s, although they still failed to clinch that elusive [[Football League First Division|First Division]] place, despite the introduction of the playoffs in the second half of the decade, which gave teams finishing as low as fifth and eventually sixth the chance of winning promotion.\n\n=== Division One and the Premier League ===\n[[File:Robbie Savage.jpg|thumb|Barnsley in action against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season. The resulting 1\u20130 defeat condemned the Tykes to relegation]]\nAt the time of the creation of the [[FA Premier League]] in 1992, Barnsley had been [[Football League]] members for 94 years but had still not reached the top flight. They were, at least, in a decent position to make that breakthrough, as members of the new [[Football League First Division|Division One]]  (as the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] was now called). In December 1989, they turned to [[Mel Machin]], manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City's]] promotion-winning side the [[1988-89 in English football|previous campaign]], to guide them into the top flight, but he left nearly four years later with promotion still to be achieved. Machin's successor [[Viv Anderson]] spent just one season in charge before quitting to become [[Bryan Robson]]'s assistant at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], and for the [[1994-95 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] Barnsley turned to veteran midfielder [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] to manage the club.\n\nWilson's first season brought a sixth-place finish in [[Football League First Division|Division One]], which would normally have meant a playoff place, but a restructuring of the league meant that they missed out. They finished 10th a year later before finally emerging as serious promotion contenders in the [[1996-97 in English football|1996\u201397 season]], finally clinching runners-up spot and automatic promotion and gaining the top flight place that they had spent 99 years trying to win.\n\nBarnsley lasted just one season in the [[Premier League]] but did not go down without a brave fight, and they did reach the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]], famously defeating [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the fifth round. They also made their record signing that season with Gjorgi Hristov for \u00a32 million pounds, a record that Barnsley FC still have. Wilson then departed to take over at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], being succeeded as Barnsley manager by veteran striker [[John Hendrie (Scottish footballer)|John Hendrie]], who had been a key player in the promotion-winning team.\n\nBarnsley were the only team from outside the [[Premier League]] to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the [[1998-99 in English football|1998\u201399 season]], but had a disappointing season in [[Football League First Division|Division One]], never really looking like winning promotion and eventually finishing a dismal 13th in the final table. Hendrie was then replaced as manager by [[Dave Bassett]], who rejuvenated the team and took them to fourth place in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]], but they lost in the playoff final to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].\n\n=== Mixed fortunes in the 21st century ===\nIn the following years Barnsley were not as successful, with relegation to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in 2002 and [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] both threatening the existence of the club. Barnsley suffered greatly due to the [[ITV Digital]] crisis. A late purchase by Barnsley's then Mayor, Peter Doyle, saved the club from folding. Doyle has since left the club, leaving Gordon Shepherd and local businessman Patrick Cryne in control. A regular turnover of managers did the club's stability no favours, either.\n\nBarnsley had the distinction of playing in the last play-off final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] before the stadium was closed for redevelopment,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/776924.stm|title=Play-off joy at last for Burley's Ipswich|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 June 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113001020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/776924.stm|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and in 2006 won in a play-off final at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], where they beat [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] 4\u20133 on penalties (2\u20132 after extra-time) to earn promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].

In November 2006, with Barnsley in the relegation zone, Ritchie was sacked in favour of [[Simon Davey]]. Davey managed to steer the team away from relegation in the second half of the season, and the eventually finished 20th.

One other notable exception came in the 2000 Division One Playoff Final against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where the team wore red shorts, thus having an all-red strip.<ref name=\"Stewart pays tribute to keeper Wright\">{{cite news|title=Stewart pays tribute to keeper Wright|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/768826.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 September 2007|date=29 May 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107023928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/768826.stm|archive-date=7 January 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Reds have also worn red shorts in their 1988\u201389 season.\n\nApart from the club's early years and the period 1921\u20131934 where the team wore black, the team has worn red or white socks for its home games. Again, the design changes from season to season.\n\nFor 2010\u201311 the kit was the traditional red, with white trim. It featured a shield style club badge to the left, with kit sponsors Lotto's logo on the opposite side. The main design was the Barnsley Building Society eagle logo, a return to the design from 2006\u201307.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 Play Off Final, Barnsley wore the new home kit for the 2016\u201317 season, but with black shorts.\n\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the home shirt was the traditional red, with a white Puma logo and club badge on the chest area. There was a white Puma logo on each shoulder. The shorts was all white with a red Puma logo and club badge on the front. The socks was red and white hooped with a Puma logo on the knee/shin area. The socks of the upcoming 2016\u201317 season were very much like the socks that Barnsley wore when they were promoted to the Premier League.\n\n==== Away strip ====\n[[File:Barnsley FC Away Shirt 98-99.png|thumb|Barnsley's away shirt in the 1998\u201399 season]]\nThe club's away strip (used for away or cup fixtures where there is a clash of colours) differs from season to season but usually follows the design of the season's home strip with a variation on the colours. The most common colour for the away shirt has been white but many others have been used, including blue, yellow, black, [[ecru]], dark green and even black and blue stripes. One notable away strip was the 2001\u201302 \"Its just like watching Brazil\" kit, where the team wore the colours of the 5-time [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] for their away games.\n\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the away shirt was a navy blue, with a gold Puma logo and club badge on the chest area. There is a gold Puma logo on each shoulder. The shorts was all navy blue with a gold Puma logo and club badge on the front. The socks are navy blue, with a gold stripe at either side, front and back. There was a gold Puma logo on the knee/shin area. The letters 'BFC' was woven into the calf area of both socks, in gold.\n\n==== Third strip ====\nBarnsley currently as a third strip, they announced and launch their third kit for the 2016\u20132017 season on the club's official website on the 19 October 2016.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://mobile.barnsleyfc.co.uk//news/article/2016-17/new-201617-third-kit-released-3356790.aspx|title=New 2016/17 Third Kit Released!|publisher=Barnsley Football Club}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016\u20132017 season, the third kit was a white shirt with a v-neck collar, with a red trim on the sleeves, and the club badge on the front of the shirt. The shirt also includes the club's sponsors;  CK Beckett logo was written on the front of the shirt in red. The Palmer logo was on the back of the shirt, and the Puma logo appears on the chest and sleeves of the shirt. The shorts were red with a white trim, which includes the sponsor logo, Bapp For Bolts, at the back of the shorts. The socks are white, the players were seen wearing white socks, when they were wearing the third kit,  during a match against Cardiff in December 2016.<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref>[http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38271833 Cardiff 3-Barnsley 4] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109190329/http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/38271833 |date=9 January 2017 }} BBC.

The team play in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]].  Nicknamed \"the Tykes\", they were founded in 1887 by [[Tiverton Preedy|Reverend Tiverton Preedy]] under the name '''Barnsley St. Peter's'''. The club's colours were originally blue, but were converted to red and white in 1904 and Barnsley have played in those colours ever since. Their home ground since 1888 has been [[Oakwell]].\n\nBarnsley won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1911\u201312 FA Cup|1911\u201312]] and were also runners-up in [[1909\u201310 FA Cup|1909\u201310]]. The club won two trophies at [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2016 \u2013 the [[Football League Trophy]], beating [[Oxford United]] 3\u20132 in the [[2016 Football League Trophy Final|final]], and the [[2016 Football League play-offs]], beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 3\u20131 in the [[2016 Football League One play-off Final|final]]. Barnsley became only the second club to secure both the [[Football League Trophy (and predecessors)|Football League Trophy]] and [[The Football League|Football League]] promotion via playoff finals in the same season, after [[Grimsby Town F.C.]].\n\nOn 19 December 2017, it was announced that Patrick Cryne and family had agreed to sell a majority stake in [[Barnsley Football Club]] to a consortium involving [[Chien Lee]] of NewCity Capital, Grace Hung and Paul Conway of Pacific Media Group, Indian businessman Neerav Parekh and baseball legend [[Billy Beane]]. The new consortium holds 80% of the shares and the Cryne family holds 20% of the shares of Barnsley Football club.<ref name=\"auto\">[https://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/club-statement/ Club Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220037/https://www.barnsleyfc.co.uk/news/2017/december/club-statement/ |date=23 December 2017 }} Barnsley F.C.

One example is [[Tommy Taylor]], who was a prolific goalscorer for Barnsley in the early 1950s and went on to win two league titles with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (as well as scoring 16 times in 19 England internationals) before losing his life in the [[Munich air disaster]]. Taylor's move to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] was for a fee of \u00a329,999 \u2013 one of the highest fees in England at the time. Taylor broke into the Barnsley team just after the sale of wing-half [[Danny Blanchflower]] to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Blanchflower would go on to sign for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and be voted [[FWA Player of the Year]] twice as well as captaining the [[North London]] club to the first [[double (association football)|league and cup double]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/sports-columnists/Tommy-Taylor--Gone-but.3662813.jp |title=Tommy Taylor&nbsp;\u2013 Gone but still not forgotten|newspaper=Yorkshire Post Online|date=12 January 2008|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n=== Beginnings and FA Cup glory ===\nBarnsley FC was established in 1887 by a [[clergy]]man, [[Tiverton Preedy]], and played in the Sheffield and District League from 1890 and then in the [[Midland League (1889)|Midland League]] from 1895. They joined [[the Football League]] in 1898, and struggled in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] for the first decade, due in part to ongoing financial difficulties. In 1910 the club reached the [[FA Cup]] final, where they lost out to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in a replay match. However, they would then reach the [[1912 FA Cup Final]] where they would defeat [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] 1\u20130 in a replay to win the trophy for the first and only time in their history.\nWhen the league restarted after [[World War I]], the 1919\u201320 season brought some significant changes to the league. The principal difference was that the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] would be increased from 20 teams to 22. The bottom team from the previous season was [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and they were duly relegated. The first extra place in the First Division went to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], who retained their place despite finishing 2nd bottom and therefore in the relegation places. [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] were rightly promoted from the Second Division which left one place to be filled. Having finished the previous season's Second Division in 3rd place (1914\u201315), Barnsley expected to achieve First Division status for the first time, but The Football League instead chose to call a ballot of the clubs. Henry Norris, the then [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] chairman, had recently moved [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] north of the [[River Thames]] to [[Highbury]], and needed First Division football to attract fans to their new home. He was later to admit some underhand dealings, allegedly including the bribing of some member clubs to vote for Arsenal's inclusion. They duly won the vote and Barnsley were consigned to the second tier of English football for another 8 decades.\n\n=== Pre-war and post-war era ===\nThe club did however come close to reaching the top division in the early years. In 1922, they missed out on promotion by a single goal. During the years preceding and following [[World War II]], the club found themselves sliding between the [[Football League Second Division|Second]] and [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\nIn 1949 the club signed a 23-year-old wing-half called [[Danny Blanchflower]] from [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]], and he so impressed at Oakwell that two years later he was signed by [[Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], later signing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and being voted [[FWA Player of the Year]] twice, as well as being the captain of the 20th century's first league and cup double winning team in 1961.\n\nAround the time of Blanchflower's departure, a young centre-forward called [[Tommy Taylor]] broke into the Barnsley team, scoring 26 goals in 44 games for Barnsley. In April 1953, he became one of the most expensive players in English football at the time when [[Matt Busby]] signed him for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for a fee of \u00a329,999. Taylor went on to be a prolific goalscorer at the highest level over the next five years, winning two league titles and also scoring 16 times in 19 appearances for the [[England national football team]], before losing his life in the [[Munich air disaster]] in February 1958.\n\n=== Fourth Division era ===\nWhen the Northern and Southern sections of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] were replaced by national [[Football League Third Division|Third]] and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Divisions]] for the [[1958-59 in English football|1958\u201359 season]], Barnsley were still in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], but went down to the Third Division at the end of that season.\n\nIn 1965, Barnsley were relegated to the Football League Fourth Division for the first time, winning promotion three years later. They went down to the Fourth Division again in 1972, and this time stayed down for seven seasons, finally returning to the Third Division in 1979.\n\n=== Revival in the 1980s ===\nTwo years later, they went up again and quickly established themselves as a decent [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] side throughout the 1980s, although they still failed to clinch that elusive [[Football League First Division|First Division]] place, despite the introduction of the playoffs in the second half of the decade, which gave teams finishing as low as fifth and eventually sixth the chance of winning promotion.\n\n=== Division One and the Premier League ===\n[[File:Robbie Savage.jpg|thumb|Barnsley in action against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] season. The resulting 1\u20130 defeat condemned the Tykes to relegation]]\nAt the time of the creation of the [[FA Premier League]] in 1992, Barnsley had been [[Football League]] members for 94 years but had still not reached the top flight. They were, at least, in a decent position to make that breakthrough, as members of the new [[Football League First Division|Division One]]  (as the old [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] was now called). In December 1989, they turned to [[Mel Machin]], manager of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City's]] promotion-winning side the [[1988-89 in English football|previous campaign]], to guide them into the top flight, but he left nearly four years later with promotion still to be achieved. Machin's successor [[Viv Anderson]] spent just one season in charge before quitting to become [[Bryan Robson]]'s assistant at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], and for the [[1994-95 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] Barnsley turned to veteran midfielder [[Danny Wilson (footballer, born 1960)|Danny Wilson]] to manage the club.\n\nWilson's first season brought a sixth-place finish in [[Football League First Division|Division One]], which would normally have meant a playoff place, but a restructuring of the league meant that they missed out. They finished 10th a year later before finally emerging as serious promotion contenders in the [[1996-97 in English football|1996\u201397 season]], finally clinching runners-up spot and automatic promotion and gaining the top flight place that they had spent 99 years trying to win.\n\nBarnsley lasted just one season in the [[Premier League]] but did not go down without a brave fight, and they did reach the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]], famously defeating [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the fifth round. They also made their record signing that season with Gjorgi Hristov for \u00a32 million pounds, a record that Barnsley FC still have. Wilson then departed to take over at [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], being succeeded as Barnsley manager by veteran striker [[John Hendrie (Scottish footballer)|John Hendrie]], who had been a key player in the promotion-winning team.\n\nBarnsley were the only team from outside the [[Premier League]] to reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in the [[1998-99 in English football|1998\u201399 season]], but had a disappointing season in [[Football League First Division|Division One]], never really looking like winning promotion and eventually finishing a dismal 13th in the final table. Hendrie was then replaced as manager by [[Dave Bassett]], who rejuvenated the team and took them to fourth place in [[1999-2000 in English football|1999\u20132000]], but they lost in the playoff final to [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].\n\n=== Mixed fortunes in the 21st century ===\nIn the following years Barnsley were not as successful, with relegation to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] in 2002 and [[administration (insolvency)|administration]] both threatening the existence of the club. Barnsley suffered greatly due to the [[ITV Digital]] crisis. A late purchase by Barnsley's then Mayor, Peter Doyle, saved the club from folding. Doyle has since left the club, leaving Gordon Shepherd and local businessman Patrick Cryne in control. A regular turnover of managers did the club's stability no favours, either.\n\nBarnsley had the distinction of playing in the last play-off final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] before the stadium was closed for redevelopment,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/776924.stm|title=Play-off joy at last for Burley's Ipswich|publisher=BBC Sport|date=29 June 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113001020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/776924.stm|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and in 2006 won in a play-off final at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], where they beat [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] 4\u20133 on penalties (2\u20132 after extra-time) to earn promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]]. The manager at this time was [[Andy Ritchie (English footballer)|Andy Ritchie]], who was in his first season in charge after replacing [[Paul Hart]].\n\nThe team struggled in their first season back in the Championship.

The only exception to this is the period 1887\u20131901, where it is speculated that the team first wore blue shirts with purple/claret arms, then circa 1890 the team wore chocolate and white stripes, before moving on to blue and white stripes around 1898. The team first wore their now traditional red shirts in 1901.<ref name=\"Barnsley \u2013 Historical Football Kits\">{{cite web|title= Barnsley&nbsp;\u2013 Historical Football Kits|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Barnsley/Barnsley.htm|publisher=Historical Kits|accessdate=4 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070905163936/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Barnsley/Barnsley.htm| archivedate= 5 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nSince this time, the team has worn red shirts often with a white trim. In more recent times a black trim has sometimes been used. As with most football clubs the shirt design varies from season to season. One particular design that stands out is the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season shirt which featured white stars on a red background and has been named as one of the worst shirts ever.<ref name=\"Room 101- The Worst Football Kits Ever\">{{cite web|title=Room 101- The Worst Football Kits Ever|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/Room_101.htm|publisher=Historical Kits|accessdate=4 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820012237/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Articles/Room_101.htm|archivedate=20 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, the kit is fondly remembered by some fans. [[sponsor (commercial)|Sponsors]] names and logos were first worn in the [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]] season and the club has had 12 different sponsors on the shirt in total. Since [[manufacturers]] logos were added to the shirt in the [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] season, the club has 12 different kit manufacturers.\n\nTraditionally, the team has worn white shorts (sometimes with red or black trim) for their home games with the only recent exceptions coming in the early years of the 20th century. One other notable exception came in the 2000 Division One Playoff Final against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where the team wore red shorts, thus having an all-red strip.<ref name=\"Stewart pays tribute to keeper Wright\">{{cite news|title=Stewart pays tribute to keeper Wright|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/768826.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 September 2007|date=29 May 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107023928/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/768826.stm|archive-date=7 January 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Reds have also worn red shorts in their 1988\u201389 season.\n\nApart from the club's early years and the period 1921\u20131934 where the team wore black, the team has worn red or white socks for its home games. Again, the design changes from season to season.\n\nFor 2010\u201311 the kit was the traditional red, with white trim. It featured a shield style club badge to the left, with kit sponsors Lotto's logo on the opposite side. The main design was the Barnsley Building Society eagle logo, a return to the design from 2006\u201307.\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 Play Off Final, Barnsley wore the new home kit for the 2016\u201317 season, but with black shorts.\n\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the home shirt was the traditional red, with a white Puma logo and club badge on the chest area. There was a white Puma logo on each shoulder. The shorts was all white with a red Puma logo and club badge on the front. The socks was red and white hooped with a Puma logo on the knee/shin area. The socks of the upcoming 2016\u201317 season were very much like the socks that Barnsley wore when they were promoted to the Premier League.\n\n==== Away strip ====\n[[File:Barnsley FC Away Shirt 98-99.png|thumb|Barnsley's away shirt in the 1998\u201399 season]]\nThe club's away strip (used for away or cup fixtures where there is a clash of colours) differs from season to season but usually follows the design of the season's home strip with a variation on the colours. The most common colour for the away shirt has been white but many others have been used, including blue, yellow, black, [[ecru]], dark green and even black and blue stripes. One notable away strip was the 2001\u201302 \"Its just like watching Brazil\" kit, where the team wore the colours of the 5-time [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winners [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] for their away games.\n\nIn the 2016\u201317 season, the away shirt was a navy blue, with a gold Puma logo and club badge on the chest area. There is a gold Puma logo on each shoulder. The shorts was all navy blue with a gold Puma logo and club badge on the front. The socks are navy blue, with a gold stripe at either side, front and back. There was a gold Puma logo on the knee/shin area. The letters 'BFC' was woven into the calf area of both socks, in gold.\n\n==== Third strip ====\nBarnsley currently as a third strip, they announced and launch their third kit for the 2016\u20132017 season on the club's official website on the 19 October 2016.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://mobile.barnsleyfc.co.uk//news/article/2016-17/new-201617-third-kit-released-3356790.aspx|title=New 2016/17 Third Kit Released!|publisher=Barnsley Football Club}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2016\u20132017 season, the third kit was a white shirt with a v-neck collar, with a red trim on the sleeves, and the club badge on the front of the shirt. The shirt also includes the club's sponsors;  CK Beckett logo was written on the front of the shirt in red.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 68, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews,\" based on 8 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nMartin Caballero of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that \"Gas Pedal\" only hinted at what his debut album will showcase, which is \"buoyed by energetic and richly textured beats, he deftly mixes slick raps with Auto-Tuned vocals on singles like 'Desert of Mirages'.\"<ref name=\"USA\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries praised the album for containing tracks that exude the same energy that \"Gas Pedal\" did, calling it a very good party album and praising Sage for being \"a great host, juggling familiar and fun with ease.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' contributor Craig Jenkins praised Sage's production and vocal delivery for carrying a lot charm into the tracks, concluding that the album \"keeps its mood light and its stakes low, and in the process delivers a much needed breezy counterpoint to all the knotty, fatalistic shit coming out of HBK\u2019s downstate peers that\u2019s every bit as true to Cali as the gangsters and the thinkers.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\nPatrick Taylor of ''RapReviews'' commended Sage for his production choices that \"favor[s] ambient elements over dance elements\" and establishing himself as a credible rapper with tracks like \"Second Hand Smoke\" and \"Go Somewhere\" that flesh out his character persona but felt he had a limited range of topics and resorted to more conventional hip-hop tropes that feel off with the record's spacious vibes. He concluding that \"It's frustrating that so many of the songs stick to the same cliched themes because Sage can actually rap. He's got a low-key charm, spitting his rhymes effortlessly [\u2026] ''Remember Me'' \"isn't a perfect album, but it has some great songs and a lot of promise. Sage the Gemini has established himself as an artist worth remembering. <ref name=\"RR\"/> ''[[HipHopDX]]'' writer Ronald Grant gave credit to both Sage and P-Lo for their consistent beat work throughout the track listing, highlighting both \"Down On Your Luck\" and \"Mad at Me\" for incorporating R&B sounds that give off a \"more melodic, delicate quality\", but was critical of the album overall feeling \"indistinguishable\" with its lyrical subject matter and production lacking \"diversity, imagination and risk-taking\" alongside similar rap radio content concluding with, \"But what Sage The Gemini lacks in lyricism and engaging subject matter, he makes up for in magnetism and harmonic finesse. ''Remember Me''{{'}}s faults definitely hold it back, but it\u2019s still largely likeable and satisfying when it comes to simply being festive West Coast party Hip Hop.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>\n\nJordan Sowunmi from ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' noted how Sage's musicianship wasn't versatile and adopted the same production more suited for \"short-burst [[Vine (service)|Vine]] videos\", but said there's an addictiveness to his \"spare aesthetic\" concluding that \"Overall, the record is buoyed by relentless exuberance and good-natured charm.\"<ref name=\"Now\"/> While finding the album filled with club tracks and lyricism that range from simplistic to odd, Jameel Raeburn of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' found the production ear-grabbing and danceable, concluding that, \"There's no question that ''Remember Me'' is best served with the volume turned all the way up.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Christopher R. Weingarten was mixed about the album, giving credit to most of the tracks for being attention-grabbing but found it monotonous in its lyrical range.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Erin Lowers of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' also praised Sage's production and voice for being distinct but criticized his lack of deeper lyrical content and songs for not leaving a lasting impact, saying that he \"presses the gas pedal too quickly before capturing your attention lyrically or sonically.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/>\n\n===Commercial performance===\n''Remember Me'' debuted at number 47 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 7,200 copies during its first-week in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harling |first=Danielle |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28149/title.hip-hop-album-sales-week-ending-3-30-2014 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: Week Ending 3/30/2014 |website=HipHopDX |publisher=Cheri Media Group |date=April 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406130043/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28149/title.hip-hop-album-sales-week-ending-3-30-2014 |archivedate=April 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Standard version\n| extra_column= Producer(s)\n\n|title1= Remember Me\n|writer1= {{flatlist|\n* [[Sage the Gemini|Dominic Wynn Woods]]\n* [[HBK Gang|Paulo Rodriguez]]\n}}\n|extra1= [[HBK Gang|P-Lo of The Invasion]]\n|length1= 2:51\n\n|title2= Bad Girls\n|writer2= Woods\n|extra2= Sage the Gemini\n|length2= 2:23\n\n|title3= Go Somewhere\n|writer3= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* [[Iamsu!|Sudan Williams]]\n}}\n|extra3= Sage the Gemini\n|note3= featuring [[Iamsu!]]\n|length3= 4:31\n\n|title4= [[Gas Pedal]]\n|writer4= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra4= {{flatlist|\n* Sage the Gemini\n}}\n|note4= featuring Iamsu!\n|length4= 3:28\n\n|title5= [[Red Nose]]\n|writer5= Woods\n|extra5= {{flatlist|\n* Sage the Gemini\n}}\n|length5= 3:13\n\n|title6= College Drop\n|writer6= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Rodriguez\n* [[HBK Gang|Jonathan Faulk]]\n}}\n|extra6= P-Lo\n|note6= featuring [[HBK Gang|Kool John]]\n|length6= 2:54\n\n|title7= Put Me On\n|writer7= Woods\n|extra7= Sage the Gemini\n|note7= featuring Shady Bo\n|length7= 3:53\n\n|title8= Down On Your Luck\n|writer8= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* August Alsina\n* Dominic Logan\n* [[Sean McMillion]]\n* [[Ralph Jeanty]]\n}}\n|extra8= [[The Exclusives]]\n|note8= featuring [[August Alsina]]\n|length8= 2:16\n\n|title9= Mad at Me\n|writer9= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* [[HBK Gang|Jay Fort]]\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra9= Jay Ant\n|note9= featuring [[HBK Gang|Jay Ant]] and Iamsu!\n|length9= 2:45\n\n|title10= Nothing to Me\n|writer10= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra10= P-Lo\n|note10= featuring Iamsu!\n|length10= 3:34\n\n|title11= Don\u2019t You\n|writer11= Woods\n|extra11= Sage the Gemini\n|length11= 2:17\n\n|title12= Second Hand Smoke\n|writer12= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Donte Blacksher\n* Eric Bellinger\n* Aaron Smith\n}}\n|extra12= [[League of Starz]]\n|note12= featuring [[Eric Bellinger]]\n|length12= 2:45\n}}\n{{Track listing\n|headline = Deluxe edition (bonus tracks)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/remember-me-deluxe-booklet/id821869113 |title=Remember Me (Deluxe Booklet Version) by Sage the Gemini |work=[[iTunes]] (US) |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n|title13= Just a Kiss\n|writer13= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Oliver Rodriguez\n}}\n|extra13= Kuya Beats of The Invasion\n|length13= 2:39\n|title14= Desert of Mirages\n|writer14= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Gilbert Milam\n* Christopher Whitacre\n* Justin Henderson\n}}\n|extra14= Tha Bizness\n|note14= featuring [[Berner (rapper)|Berner]] and [[Kehlani]]\n|length14= 4:29\n|title15= Give It Up\n|writer15= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Milam\n* P.

At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an [[weighted mean|average]] score of 68, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews,\" based on 8 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nMartin Caballero of ''[[USA Today]]'' said that \"Gas Pedal\" only hinted at what his debut album will showcase, which is \"buoyed by energetic and richly textured beats, he deftly mixes slick raps with Auto-Tuned vocals on singles like 'Desert of Mirages'.\"<ref name=\"USA\"/> [[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries praised the album for containing tracks that exude the same energy that \"Gas Pedal\" did, calling it a very good party album and praising Sage for being \"a great host, juggling familiar and fun with ease.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' contributor Craig Jenkins praised Sage's production and vocal delivery for carrying a lot charm into the tracks, concluding that the album \"keeps its mood light and its stakes low, and in the process delivers a much needed breezy counterpoint to all the knotty, fatalistic shit coming out of HBK\u2019s downstate peers that\u2019s every bit as true to Cali as the gangsters and the thinkers.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/>\n\nPatrick Taylor of ''RapReviews'' commended Sage for his production choices that \"favor[s] ambient elements over dance elements\" and establishing himself as a credible rapper with tracks like \"Second Hand Smoke\" and \"Go Somewhere\" that flesh out his character persona but felt he had a limited range of topics and resorted to more conventional hip-hop tropes that feel off with the record's spacious vibes. He concluding that \"It's frustrating that so many of the songs stick to the same cliched themes because Sage can actually rap. He's got a low-key charm, spitting his rhymes effortlessly [\u2026] ''Remember Me'' \"isn't a perfect album, but it has some great songs and a lot of promise. Sage the Gemini has established himself as an artist worth remembering. <ref name=\"RR\"/> ''[[HipHopDX]]'' writer Ronald Grant gave credit to both Sage and P-Lo for their consistent beat work throughout the track listing, highlighting both \"Down On Your Luck\" and \"Mad at Me\" for incorporating R&B sounds that give off a \"more melodic, delicate quality\", but was critical of the album overall feeling \"indistinguishable\" with its lyrical subject matter and production lacking \"diversity, imagination and risk-taking\" alongside similar rap radio content concluding with, \"But what Sage The Gemini lacks in lyricism and engaging subject matter, he makes up for in magnetism and harmonic finesse. ''Remember Me''{{'}}s faults definitely hold it back, but it\u2019s still largely likeable and satisfying when it comes to simply being festive West Coast party Hip Hop.\"<ref name=\"HHDX\"/>\n\nJordan Sowunmi from ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' noted how Sage's musicianship wasn't versatile and adopted the same production more suited for \"short-burst [[Vine (service)|Vine]] videos\", but said there's an addictiveness to his \"spare aesthetic\" concluding that \"Overall, the record is buoyed by relentless exuberance and good-natured charm.\"<ref name=\"Now\"/> While finding the album filled with club tracks and lyricism that range from simplistic to odd, Jameel Raeburn of ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' found the production ear-grabbing and danceable, concluding that, \"There's no question that ''Remember Me'' is best served with the volume turned all the way up.\"<ref name=\"XXL\"/>  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Christopher R. Weingarten was mixed about the album, giving credit to most of the tracks for being attention-grabbing but found it monotonous in its lyrical range.<ref name=\"RS\"/> Erin Lowers of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' also praised Sage's production and voice for being distinct but criticized his lack of deeper lyrical content and songs for not leaving a lasting impact, saying that he \"presses the gas pedal too quickly before capturing your attention lyrically or sonically.\"<ref name=\"Exclaim\"/>\n\n===Commercial performance===\n''Remember Me'' debuted at number 47 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 7,200 copies during its first-week in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harling |first=Danielle |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28149/title.hip-hop-album-sales-week-ending-3-30-2014 |title=Hip Hop Album Sales: Week Ending 3/30/2014 |website=HipHopDX |publisher=Cheri Media Group |date=April 2, 2014 |accessdate=April 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406130043/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.28149/title.hip-hop-album-sales-week-ending-3-30-2014 |archivedate=April 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Standard version\n| extra_column= Producer(s)\n\n|title1= Remember Me\n|writer1= {{flatlist|\n* [[Sage the Gemini|Dominic Wynn Woods]]\n* [[HBK Gang|Paulo Rodriguez]]\n}}\n|extra1= [[HBK Gang|P-Lo of The Invasion]]\n|length1= 2:51\n\n|title2= Bad Girls\n|writer2= Woods\n|extra2= Sage the Gemini\n|length2= 2:23\n\n|title3= Go Somewhere\n|writer3= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* [[Iamsu!|Sudan Williams]]\n}}\n|extra3= Sage the Gemini\n|note3= featuring [[Iamsu!]]\n|length3= 4:31\n\n|title4= [[Gas Pedal]]\n|writer4= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra4= {{flatlist|\n* Sage the Gemini\n}}\n|note4= featuring Iamsu!\n|length4= 3:28\n\n|title5= [[Red Nose]]\n|writer5= Woods\n|extra5= {{flatlist|\n* Sage the Gemini\n}}\n|length5= 3:13\n\n|title6= College Drop\n|writer6= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Rodriguez\n* [[HBK Gang|Jonathan Faulk]]\n}}\n|extra6= P-Lo\n|note6= featuring [[HBK Gang|Kool John]]\n|length6= 2:54\n\n|title7= Put Me On\n|writer7= Woods\n|extra7= Sage the Gemini\n|note7= featuring Shady Bo\n|length7= 3:53\n\n|title8= Down On Your Luck\n|writer8= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* August Alsina\n* Dominic Logan\n* [[Sean McMillion]]\n* [[Ralph Jeanty]]\n}}\n|extra8= [[The Exclusives]]\n|note8= featuring [[August Alsina]]\n|length8= 2:16\n\n|title9= Mad at Me\n|writer9= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* [[HBK Gang|Jay Fort]]\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra9= Jay Ant\n|note9= featuring [[HBK Gang|Jay Ant]] and Iamsu!\n|length9= 2:45\n\n|title10= Nothing to Me\n|writer10= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Williams\n}}\n|extra10= P-Lo\n|note10= featuring Iamsu!\n|length10= 3:34\n\n|title11= Don\u2019t You\n|writer11= Woods\n|extra11= Sage the Gemini\n|length11= 2:17\n\n|title12= Second Hand Smoke\n|writer12= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Donte Blacksher\n* Eric Bellinger\n* Aaron Smith\n}}\n|extra12= [[League of Starz]]\n|note12= featuring [[Eric Bellinger]]\n|length12= 2:45\n}}\n{{Track listing\n|headline = Deluxe edition (bonus tracks)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/remember-me-deluxe-booklet/id821869113 |title=Remember Me (Deluxe Booklet Version) by Sage the Gemini |work=[[iTunes]] (US) |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n| collapsed = yes\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n|title13= Just a Kiss\n|writer13= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Oliver Rodriguez\n}}\n|extra13= Kuya Beats of The Invasion\n|length13= 2:39\n|title14= Desert of Mirages\n|writer14= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Gilbert Milam\n* Christopher Whitacre\n* Justin Henderson\n}}\n|extra14= Tha Bizness\n|note14= featuring [[Berner (rapper)|Berner]] and [[Kehlani]]\n|length14= 4:29\n|title15= Give It Up\n|writer15= {{flatlist|\n* Woods\n* Milam\n* P.

He was elected a [[fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and later appointed lecturer at [[Merton College]]. Best known of his many works was ''The Elizabethan Age'' trilogy. His work on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] included a claim to have identified the '[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady of the Sonnets]]' as [[Emilia Lanier]], which attracted much interest from scholars, but also many counter-claims.\n\nRowse was in steady demand as a lecturer in America. In the 1930s, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] interest, though he ended as a conservative in old age.\n\n==Life and politics==\nRowse was born at Tregonissey, near [[St Austell]], Cornwall, the son of Annie (n\u00e9e Vanson) and Richard Rowse, a [[china clay]] worker. Despite his parents being poor and having little formal education, he won a place at [[St Austell]] [[County]] [[Grammar School]] and then a scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1921. He was encouraged in his pursuit of an academic career by a fellow Cornish man of letters, [[Sir]] [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]], of [[Polperro]], who recognised his ability from an early age. Rowse endured doubting comments about his paternity, thus he paid particular attention to his mother's association with a local farmer and butcher from [[Polgooth]], near St Austell, Frederick William May (1872\u20131953).<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/100 Richard Ollard; ''A Man of Contradictions: A Life of A. L. Rowse'']</ref> Any such frustrations were channelled into academia, which reaped him dividends later in life.\n\nRowse had planned to study English literature, having developed an early love of poetry, but was persuaded to read history. He was a popular undergraduate and made many friendships that lasted for life. He graduated with first class honours in 1925 and was elected a [[fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] the same year. In 1929, he proceeded to a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree. In 1927 he was appointed lecturer at [[Merton College]], where he stayed until 1930. He then became a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]].\n\nIn 1931, Rowse contested the parliamentary seat of [[Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn and Falmouth]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but was unsuccessful, finishing third behind a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]. In the general election of 1935 he again stood unsuccessfully, but managed to finish in second place, ahead of the Liberal. In both the 1931 and 1935 elections, [[Maurice Petherick]] was returned as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] to Parliament, albeit with a minority of the vote. Rowse supported calls made by the likes of [[Sir]] [[Stafford Cripps]] for a [[Popular Front (UK)|\"Popular Front\"]], who was expelled from office for his views. Rowse worked to get agreement by Labour and Liberal parties in Devon and Cornwall, making a common cause with the Liberal MP [[Baronet|Sir]] [[Richard Acland]]. A general election was expected to take place in 1939, and Rowse, who was again Labour's candidate for Penryn & Falmouth, was not expected to have a Liberal opponent. That would increase his chances of winning. But, due to outbreak of war, the election did not take place and his career was effectively ended.\n\nUndeterred, Rowse chose to continue his career by seeking administrative positions at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] becoming [[Warden (college)|Sub-Warden]] of [[All Souls College]]. In 1952, he failed in his candidacy for election as Warden against [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]]. Shortly afterwards he began what became  regular trips to [[The Huntington Library]] in Southern California, where for many years he was a senior research fellow. He received a doctorate ([[DLitt]]) from Oxford University in 1953. After delivering the [[British Academy]]'s 1957 Raleigh Lecture on history about [[Sir]] [[Richard Grenville]]'s place in English history, Rowse was selected as a fellow of the academy ([[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]]) in 1958.\n\nRowse published about 100 books. By the mid-20th century, he was a celebrated author and much-travelled lecturer, especially in the United States. He also published many popular articles in newspapers and magazines in Great Britain and the United States. His brilliance was widely recognised. His knack for the sensational, as well as his academic boldness (which some considered to be irresponsible carelessness), sustained his reputation. His opinions on rival popular historians, such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and [[A. J. P. Taylor]], were expressed sometimes in very ripe terms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn his later years, Rowse moved increasingly towards the political right, and many considered him to be part of the Tory tradition by the time he died. One of Rowse's lifelong themes in his books and articles was his condemnation of the National Government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and the economic and political consequences for Great Britain of fighting a second war with Germany. Another was his horror at the degradation of standards in modern society. He is reported as saying: \"...this filthy twentieth century. I hate its guts\".\n\nDespite international academic success, Rowse remained proud of his Cornish roots. He retired from Oxford in 1973 to [[Trenarren|Trenarren House]], his Cornish home, from where he remained active as writer, reviewer and conversationalist until immobilised by a stroke the year before his death. His ashes are buried in the Campdowns Cemetery, [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]] near [[St Austell]].\n\n===Elizabethan and Shakespearean scholarship===\nRowse's early works focus on 16th-century England and his first full-length historical monograph, ''Sir Richard Grenville of the Revenge'' (1937), was a biography of a 16th-century sailor. His next was ''Tudor Cornwall'' (1941), a lively detailed account of Cornish society in the 16th century. He consolidated his reputation with a one-volume general history of England, ''The Spirit of English History'' (1943), but his most important work was the historical trilogy ''The Elizabethan Age'': ''The England of Elizabeth'' (1950), ''The Expansion of Elizabethan England'' (1955), and ''The Elizabethan Renaissance'' (1971\u201372), respectively examine the society, overseas exploration, and culture of late 16th-century England.\n\nIn 1963 Rowse began to concentrate on Shakespeare, starting with a biography in which he claimed to have dated all the sonnets, identified [[Christopher Marlowe]] as the suitor's rival and solved all but one of the other problems posed by the sonnets. His failure to acknowledge his reliance upon the work of other scholars alienated some of his peers, but he won popular acclaim. In 1973 he published ''Shakespeare the Man'', in which he claimed to have solved the final problem \u2013 the identity of the '[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]': from a [[close reading]] of the sonnets and the diaries of [[Simon Forman]], he asserted that she must have been [[Emilia Lanier]], whose poems he would later collect. He suggested that Shakespeare had been influenced by the feud between the Danvers and [[Sir Robert Long (c.1517-c.1581)|Long families]] in Wiltshire, when he wrote ''Romeo and Juliet''. The Danverses were friends of the 3rd Earl of Southampton.\n\nRowse's \"discoveries\" about Shakespeare's sonnets amount to the following:\n\n# The Fair Youth was the 19-year-old [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], extremely handsome and bisexual.\n# The sonnets were written 1592\u20131594/5.\n# The \"rival poet\" was [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n# The \"Dark Lady\" was [[Emilia Lanier]]. His use of the diaries of [[Simon Forman]], which contained material about her, influenced other scholars.\n# Christopher Marlowe's death is recorded in the sonnets.\n# Shakespeare was a heterosexual man, who was faced with an unusual situation when the handsome, young, bisexual Earl of Southampton fell in love with him.\n\nRowse was dismissive of those who rejected his views. He supported his conclusions. In the case of Shakespeare's sexuality, he emphasised the playwright's heterosexual inclinations by noting that he had impregnated an older woman by the time he was 18, and was consequently obliged to marry her. Moreover, he fathered three children by the time he was 21. In the sonnets, Shakespeare's explicit erotic interest lies with the Dark Lady; he obsesses about her. Shakespeare was still married and Rowse believes he was having an extramarital affair.\n\n===Personal attitudes===\n\nThe diary excerpts published in 2003 reveal that \"he was an overt even rather proud homosexual in a pre-[[Wolfenden report|Wolfenden]] age, fascinated by young policemen and sailors, obsessively speculating on the sexual proclivities of everyone he meets\".<ref name=\"smith\">{{Citation\n|last = Smith|first = Anthony|title = The Diaries of AL Rowse, edited by Richard Ollard, The Penguin Press (review)|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 13 April 2003|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/13/biography.features1|accessdate = 24 Jun 2015}}</ref> Much later, following retirement, he said, \"of course, I used to be a homo; but now, when it doesn't matter, if anything I'm a hetero\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69050|title=Rowse, (Alfred) Leslie (1903\u20131997), historian |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>\n\nHe was aware of his own intelligence from earliest childhood, and obsessed that others either did not accept this fact, or not quickly enough. The diaries describe what he said were \"a series of often inane jealousies\".<ref name=smith/>\n\nHe described a \"Slacker State\": \"I don't want to have my money scalped off me to maintain other people's children. I don't like other people; I particularly don't like their children; I deeply disapprove of their proliferation making the globe uninhabitable. The fucking idiots \u2013 I don't want to pay for their fucking.\"<ref name=smith/>\n\n==Literary career==\nRowse's first book was ''On History, a Study of Present Tendencies'' published in 1927 as the seventh volume of [[Kegan Paul]]'s ''Psyche Miniature General Series''. In 1931 he contributed to [[T. S. Eliot]]'s quarterly review ''[[The Criterion]]''. In 1935 he co-edited [[Charles G. Henderson|Charles Henderson]]'s ''Essays in Cornish History'' for the [[Clarendon Press]]. His best-seller was his first volume of autobiography, ''A Cornish Childhood'', first published by Jonathan Cape in 1942, which has gone on to sell nearly half a million copies worldwide. It describes his hard struggle to get to the University of Oxford and his love/hate relationship with Cornwall.\n\nHis most controversial book (at the time of publication) was on the subject of human sexuality: ''Homosexuals In History'' (1977).\n\nRowse wrote poetry all his life. He contributed poems to ''Public School Verse'' whilst at St Austell Grammar School. He also had verse published in ''Oxford 1923'', ''Oxford 1924'', and ''Oxford 1925''. His collected poems ''A Life'' were published in 1981. The poetry is mainly autobiographical, descriptive of place (especially Cornwall) and people he knew and cared for, e.g. ''The Progress of Love'', which describes his platonic love for [[Adam von Trott zu Solz|Adam von Trott]], a handsome and aristocratic German youth who studied at Oxford in the 1930s and who was later executed for his part in the [[July 20 plot|July Plot of 1944]] to kill [[Hitler]]. Unusually for a British poet, Rowse wrote a great number of poems inspired by American scenery.\n\n===Biographer===\nHe wrote other biographies of English historical and literary figures, and many other historical works. His biographies include studies of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and the Earl of Southampton, the major players in the sonnets, as well as later luminaries of English literature such as Milton, Swift and Matthew Arnold. A devoted cat-lover, he also wrote the biographies of several cats who came to live with him at Trenarren, claiming that it was as much a challenge to write the biography of a favourite cat as it was a Queen of England. He also published a number of short stories, mainly about Cornwall, of interest more for their thinly veiled autobiographical resonances than their literary merit. His last book, ''My View of Shakespeare'', published in 1996, summed up his life-time's appreciation of ''The Bard of Stratford''. The book was dedicated ''\"To HRH The Prince of Wales in common devotion to William Shakespeare\".''\n\n===Bibliophile===\nOne of Rowse's great enthusiasms was collecting books, and he owned many first editions, many of them bearing his acerbic annotations. For example, his copy of the January 1924 edition of ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|The Adelphi]]'' magazine edited by [[John Middleton Murry]] bears a pencilled note after Murry's poem ''In Memory of [[Katherine Mansfield]]'': 'Sentimental gush on the part of JMM. And a bad poem. A.L.R.'\n\nUpon his death in 1997 he bequeathed his book collection to the [[University of Exeter]], and his personal archive of manuscripts, diaries, and correspondence. In 1998 the University Librarian selected about sixty books from Rowse's own working library and a complete set of his published books. [[Royal Institution of Cornwall|The Royal Institution of Cornwall]] selected some of the remaining books and the rest were sold to dealers. The London booksellers [[Heywood Hill]] produced two catalogues of books from his library.\n\n==Honours==\nRowse was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] ([[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]]), of the [[Royal Historical Society]] ([[FRHistS]]) and of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] ([[FRSL]]).\n\nIn addition to his [[Doctor of Letters|DLitt (Oxon)]] degree (1953), Rowse received the [[honorary degree]]s of DLitt from the [[University of Exeter]] in 1960 and [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from the [[University of New Brunswick]], Fredericton, Canada, the same year.\n\nIn 1968 he was made a [[Bard]] of [[Gorseth Kernow]], taking the [[bardic name]] ''Lef A Gernow'' ('Voice of Cornwall'), reflecting his high standing in the Cornish community.\n\nHe was elected to the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] under Rule II in 1972, and received the [[Benson Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1982.<ref>Adamson, Donald, [http://interlitq.org/issue6/donald_adamson/job.php \"A.L.

He was elected a [[fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and later appointed lecturer at [[Merton College]]. Best known of his many works was ''The Elizabethan Age'' trilogy. His work on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] included a claim to have identified the '[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady of the Sonnets]]' as [[Emilia Lanier]], which attracted much interest from scholars, but also many counter-claims.\n\nRowse was in steady demand as a lecturer in America. In the 1930\u2019s, he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] interest, though he ended as a conservative in old age.\n\n==Life and politics==\nRowse was born at Tregonissey, near [[St Austell]], Cornwall, the son of Annie (n\u00e9e Vanson) and Richard Rowse, a [[china clay]] worker. Despite his parents being poor and having little formal education, he won a place at [[St Austell]] [[County]] [[Grammar School]] and then a scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1921. He was encouraged in his pursuit of an academic career by a fellow Cornish man of letters, [[Sir]] [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]], of [[Polperro]], who recognised his ability from an early age. Rowse endured doubting comments about his paternity, thus he paid particular attention to his mother's association with a local farmer and butcher from [[Polgooth]], near St Austell, Frederick William May (1872\u20131953).<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/100 Richard Ollard; ''A Man of Contradictions: A Life of A. L. Rowse'']</ref> Any such frustrations were channelled into academia, which reaped him dividends later in life.\n\nRowse had planned to study English literature, having developed an early love of poetry, but was persuaded to read history. He was a popular undergraduate and made many friendships that lasted for life. He graduated with first class honours in 1925 and was elected a [[fellow]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] the same year. In 1929, he proceeded to a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge, and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree. In 1927 he was appointed lecturer at [[Merton College]], where he stayed until 1930. He then became a lecturer at the [[London School of Economics]].\n\nIn 1931, Rowse contested the parliamentary seat of [[Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Penryn and Falmouth]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but was unsuccessful, finishing third behind a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]. In the general election of 1935 he again stood unsuccessfully, but managed to finish in second place, ahead of the Liberal. In both the 1931 and 1935 elections, [[Maurice Petherick]] was returned as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] to Parliament, albeit with a minority of the vote. Rowse supported calls made by the likes of [[Sir]] [[Stafford Cripps]] for a [[Popular Front (UK)|\"Popular Front\"]], who was expelled from office for his views. Rowse worked to get agreement by Labour and Liberal parties in Devon and Cornwall, making a common cause with the Liberal MP [[Baronet|Sir]] [[Richard Acland]]. A general election was expected to take place in 1939, and Rowse, who was again Labour's candidate for Penryn & Falmouth, was not expected to have a Liberal opponent. That would increase his chances of winning. But, due to outbreak of war, the election did not take place and his career was effectively ended.\n\nUndeterred, Rowse chose to continue his career by seeking administrative positions at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] becoming [[Warden (college)|Sub-Warden]] of [[All Souls College]]. In 1952, he failed in his candidacy for election as Warden against [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]]. Shortly afterwards he began what became  regular trips to [[The Huntington Library]] in Southern California, where for many years he was a senior research fellow. He received a doctorate ([[DLitt]]) from Oxford University in 1953. After delivering the [[British Academy]]'s 1957 Raleigh Lecture on history about [[Sir]] [[Richard Grenville]]'s place in English history, Rowse was selected as a fellow of the academy ([[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]]) in 1958.\n\nRowse published about 100 books. By the mid-20th century, he was a celebrated author and much-travelled lecturer, especially in the United States. He also published many popular articles in newspapers and magazines in Great Britain and the United States. His brilliance was widely recognised. His knack for the sensational, as well as his academic boldness (which some considered to be irresponsible carelessness), sustained his reputation. His opinions on rival popular historians, such as [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and [[A. J. P. Taylor]], were expressed sometimes in very ripe terms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn his later years, Rowse moved increasingly towards the political right, and many considered him to be part of the Tory tradition by the time he died. One of Rowse's lifelong themes in his books and articles was his condemnation of the National Government's policy of appeasement of Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and the economic and political consequences for Great Britain of fighting a second war with Germany. Another was his horror at the degradation of standards in modern society. He is reported as saying: \"...this filthy twentieth century. I hate its guts\".\n\nDespite international academic success, Rowse remained proud of his Cornish roots. He retired from Oxford in 1973 to [[Trenarren|Trenarren House]], his Cornish home, from where he remained active as writer, reviewer and conversationalist until immobilised by a stroke the year before his death. His ashes are buried in the Campdowns Cemetery, [[Charlestown, Cornwall|Charlestown]] near [[St Austell]].\n\n===Elizabethan and Shakespearean scholarship===\nRowse's early works focus on 16th-century England and his first full-length historical monograph, ''Sir Richard Grenville of the Revenge'' (1937), was a biography of a 16th-century sailor. His next was ''Tudor Cornwall'' (1941), a lively detailed account of Cornish society in the 16th century. He consolidated his reputation with a one-volume general history of England, ''The Spirit of English History'' (1943), but his most important work was the historical trilogy ''The Elizabethan Age'': ''The England of Elizabeth'' (1950), ''The Expansion of Elizabethan England'' (1955), and ''The Elizabethan Renaissance'' (1971\u201372), respectively examine the society, overseas exploration, and culture of late 16th-century England.\n\nIn 1963 Rowse began to concentrate on Shakespeare, starting with a biography in which he claimed to have dated all the sonnets, identified [[Christopher Marlowe]] as the suitor's rival and solved all but one of the other problems posed by the sonnets. His failure to acknowledge his reliance upon the work of other scholars alienated some of his peers, but he won popular acclaim. In 1973 he published ''Shakespeare the Man'', in which he claimed to have solved the final problem \u2013 the identity of the '[[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]]': from a [[close reading]] of the sonnets and the diaries of [[Simon Forman]], he asserted that she must have been [[Emilia Lanier]], whose poems he would later collect. He suggested that Shakespeare had been influenced by the feud between the Danvers and [[Sir Robert Long (c.1517-c.1581)|Long families]] in Wiltshire, when he wrote ''Romeo and Juliet''. The Danverses were friends of the 3rd Earl of Southampton.\n\nRowse's \"discoveries\" about Shakespeare's sonnets amount to the following:\n\n# The Fair Youth was the 19-year-old [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], extremely handsome and bisexual.\n# The sonnets were written 1592\u20131594/5.\n# The \"rival poet\" was [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n# The \"Dark Lady\" was [[Emilia Lanier]]. His use of the diaries of [[Simon Forman]], which contained material about her, influenced other scholars.\n# Christopher Marlowe's death is recorded in the sonnets.\n# Shakespeare was a heterosexual man, who was faced with an unusual situation when the handsome, young, bisexual Earl of Southampton fell in love with him.\n\nRowse was dismissive of those who rejected his views. He supported his conclusions. In the case of Shakespeare's sexuality, he emphasised the playwright's heterosexual inclinations by noting that he had impregnated an older woman by the time he was 18, and was consequently obliged to marry her. Moreover, he fathered three children by the time he was 21. In the sonnets, Shakespeare's explicit erotic interest lies with the Dark Lady; he obsesses about her. Shakespeare was still married and Rowse believes he was having an extramarital affair.\n\n===Personal attitudes===\n\nThe diary excerpts published in 2003 reveal that \"he was an overt even rather proud homosexual in a pre-[[Wolfenden report|Wolfenden]] age, fascinated by young policemen and sailors, obsessively speculating on the sexual proclivities of everyone he meets\".<ref name=\"smith\">{{Citation\n|last = Smith|first = Anthony|title = The Diaries of AL Rowse, edited by Richard Ollard, The Penguin Press (review)|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 13 April 2003|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/13/biography.features1|accessdate = 24 Jun 2015}}</ref> Much later, following retirement, he said, \"of course, I used to be a homo; but now, when it doesn't matter, if anything I'm a hetero\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/69050|title=Rowse, (Alfred) Leslie (1903\u20131997), historian |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>\n\nHe was aware of his own intelligence from earliest childhood, and obsessed that others either did not accept this fact, or not quickly enough. The diaries describe what he said were \"a series of often inane jealousies\".<ref name=smith/>\n\nHe described a \"Slacker State\": \"I don't want to have my money scalped off me to maintain other people's children. I don't like other people; I particularly don't like their children; I deeply disapprove of their proliferation making the globe uninhabitable. The fucking idiots \u2013 I don't want to pay for their fucking.\"<ref name=smith/>\n\n==Literary career==\nRowse's first book was ''On History, a Study of Present Tendencies'' published in 1927 as the seventh volume of [[Kegan Paul]]'s ''Psyche Miniature General Series''. In 1931 he contributed to [[T. S. Eliot]]'s quarterly review ''[[The Criterion]]''. In 1935 he co-edited [[Charles G. Henderson|Charles Henderson]]'s ''Essays in Cornish History'' for the [[Clarendon Press]]. His best-seller was his first volume of autobiography, ''A Cornish Childhood'', first published by Jonathan Cape in 1942, which has gone on to sell nearly half a million copies worldwide. It describes his hard struggle to get to the University of Oxford and his love/hate relationship with Cornwall.\n\nHis most controversial book (at the time of publication) was on the subject of human sexuality: ''Homosexuals In History'' (1977).\n\nRowse wrote poetry all his life. He contributed poems to ''Public School Verse'' whilst at St Austell Grammar School. He also had verse published in ''Oxford 1923'', ''Oxford 1924'', and ''Oxford 1925''. His collected poems ''A Life'' were published in 1981. The poetry is mainly autobiographical, descriptive of place (especially Cornwall) and people he knew and cared for, e.g. ''The Progress of Love'', which describes his platonic love for [[Adam von Trott zu Solz|Adam von Trott]], a handsome and aristocratic German youth who studied at Oxford in the 1930s and who was later executed for his part in the [[July 20 plot|July Plot of 1944]] to kill [[Hitler]]. Unusually for a British poet, Rowse wrote a great number of poems inspired by American scenery.\n\n===Biographer===\nHe wrote other biographies of English historical and literary figures, and many other historical works. His biographies include studies of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and the Earl of Southampton, the major players in the sonnets, as well as later luminaries of English literature such as Milton, Swift and Matthew Arnold. A devoted cat-lover, he also wrote the biographies of several cats who came to live with him at Trenarren, claiming that it was as much a challenge to write the biography of a favourite cat as it was a Queen of England. He also published a number of short stories, mainly about Cornwall, of interest more for their thinly veiled autobiographical resonances than their literary merit. His last book, ''My View of Shakespeare'', published in 1996, summed up his life-time's appreciation of ''The Bard of Stratford''. The book was dedicated ''\"To HRH The Prince of Wales in common devotion to William Shakespeare\".''\n\n===Bibliophile===\nOne of Rowse's great enthusiasms was collecting books, and he owned many first editions, many of them bearing his acerbic annotations. For example, his copy of the January 1924 edition of ''[[Adelphi (magazine)|The Adelphi]]'' magazine edited by [[John Middleton Murry]] bears a pencilled note after Murry's poem ''In Memory of [[Katherine Mansfield]]'': 'Sentimental gush on the part of JMM. And a bad poem. A.L.R.'\n\nUpon his death in 1997 he bequeathed his book collection to the [[University of Exeter]], and his personal archive of manuscripts, diaries, and correspondence. In 1998 the University Librarian selected about sixty books from Rowse's own working library and a complete set of his published books. [[Royal Institution of Cornwall|The Royal Institution of Cornwall]] selected some of the remaining books and the rest were sold to dealers. The London booksellers [[Heywood Hill]] produced two catalogues of books from his library.\n\n==Honours==\nRowse was elected a [[Fellow]] of the [[British Academy]] ([[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]]), of the [[Royal Historical Society]] ([[FRHistS]]) and of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] ([[FRSL]]).\n\nIn addition to his [[Doctor of Letters|DLitt (Oxon)]] degree (1953), Rowse received the [[honorary degree]]s of DLitt from the [[University of Exeter]] in 1960 and [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]] from the [[University of New Brunswick]], Fredericton, Canada, the same year.\n\nIn 1968 he was made a [[Bard]] of [[Gorseth Kernow]], taking the [[bardic name]] ''Lef A Gernow'' ('Voice of Cornwall'), reflecting his high standing in the Cornish community.\n\nHe was elected to the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] under Rule II in 1972, and received the [[Benson Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 1982.<ref>Adamson, Donald, [http://interlitq.org/issue6/donald_adamson/job.php \"A.L. Rowse: An Appreciation (from a biography-in-progress)\"], ''The International Literary Quarterly'', Issue 6, February 2009.</ref>\n\nRowse was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] ([[Companion of Honour|CH]]) in the [[1997 New Year Honours]].\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\n[[File:Memorial to A.L. Rowse - geograph.org.uk - 103780.jpg|Memorial to Rowse at Black Head, near Trenarren|thumb]]\nAs well as his own appearances on radio and television, Rowse has been depicted in various [[Docudrama|TV drama documentaries]] about British politics in the 1930s and [[appeasement]].\n\nChristopher William Hill's [[radio drama|radio play]] ''Accolades'', rebroadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in March 2007 as a tribute to its star, [[Ian Richardson]], who had died the previous month, covers the period leading up to the publication of ''Shakespeare the Man'' in 1973 and publicity surrounding Rowse's unshakable confidence that he had discovered the identity of the Dark Lady of the Sonnets. It was broadcast again on 9 July 2008.\n\n''A Cornish Childhood'' has also been adapted for voices (in the style of ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'') by [[Judith Cook]].\n\n== Selected works ==\n* ''On History: a Study of Present Tendencies'', London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., 1927\n* ''Science and History: a New View of History'', London: W.
