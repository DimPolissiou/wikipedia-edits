'''iPhone''' (colloquially known as the '''iPhone 2G''' and '''iPhone 1''' after 2008 to differentiate it from later models) is the first [[smartphone]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|author=Dolan, Brian |title=Timeline of Apple \"iPhone\" Rumors (1999\u2013Present)

United States on June 29, 2007. It featured [[quad-band]] [[GSM]] cellular connectivity with [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] support for data transfer.\n\nDevelopment of the iPhone dated back to 2005, when former Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived the idea. The design was expanded upon over the next 2 years in complete secrecy, before being announced in Q1 of 2007.\n\nAlthough several aspects of the iPhone are considered obsolete by current standards, the device is seen as a prototype for current cell phones, eliminating most physical hardware buttons and stylus in favor of a touch-based user interface. The phone is one of the most acclaimed phones. Its successor, the [[iPhone 3G]], was announced in June 2008.\n\n==History==\n{{main | History of iPhone}}\nIn 2005, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived an idea of using a [[touchscreen]] to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time. He decided that the device would require a triple layered [[Capacitive touchscreen|capacitive]] [[multi-touch]] [[touch screen]], a very new and advanced technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], the same as a [[tablet computer]]. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Peter |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update |publisher=[[Macworld]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127110536/http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}</ref>  When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its [[user interface]], he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone.<ref>{{cite video\n |people=[[Walter Mossberg]]; [[Kara Swisher]] \n |date=June 2, 2010 \n |title=D8: Steve Jobs on the iPhone's Origin \n |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |publisher=All Things Digital \n |accessdate=June 20, 2010 \n |time=0:20 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525110502/http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |archivedate=May 25, 2011 \n}}</ref> The whole effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Murtazin \n |first=Eldar \n |url=http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/iphone-history3-en.shtml \n |title=Apple's Phone: From 1980s' Sketches to iPhone.

'''iPhone''' (colloquially known as the '''iPhone 2G''' and '''iPhone 1''' after 2008 to differentiate it from later models) is the first [[smartphone]] designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|author=Dolan, Brian |title=Timeline of Apple \"iPhone\" Rumors (1999\u2013Present)

United States on June 29, 2007. It featured [[quad-band]] [[GSM]] cellular connectivity with [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] support for data transfer.\n\nDevelopment of the iPhone dated back to 2005, when former Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived the idea. The design was expanded upon over the next 2 years in complete secrecy, before being announced in Q1 of 2007.\n\nAlthough several aspects of the iPhone are considered obsolete by current standards, the device is seen as a prototype for current cell phones, eliminating most physical hardware buttons and stylus in favor of a touch-based user interface. Its successor, the [[iPhone 3G]], was announced in June 2008.\n\n==History==\n{{main | History of iPhone}}\nIn 2005, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived an idea of using a [[touchscreen]] to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time.

He enjoyed a rags-to-riches career, from working as a \u2018miller\u2019s boy\u2019 at St. Albans to becoming the owner of one of the largest breweries in the London area.\n\nHalsey left his home town of St Albans and went to London \u2018with 4s.6d. only in his pocket\u2019, and found work at James Child's [[Anchor Brewery]] in Southwark. He began by sweeping the yards, but was promoted to become clerk of the brewery's counting-house. He eventually married James Child's only daughter Anne Child on 17 October 1693, and became a partner in the business. By May 1696 he had already garnered enough wealth to loan \u00a31,000 to the crown. When Child died in September 1696,  he assumed complete control of the brewery.  By that time Halsey may have already become involved in local politics, for the elections committee reported in December 1696 on the testimony of a \u2018Mr Halsey\u2019 on a disputed election. He became Freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Brewers|Brewers\u2019 Company]] in 1697.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/halsey-edmund-1729| title=HALSEY, Edmund (d. 1729), of St. Saviour\u2019s, Southwark, Surr. and Stoke Poges, Bucks. | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690-1715)| accessdate = 8 March 2019 }}</ref> \n \nHalsey was put forward as a candidate in December 1711 for [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]], which had several brewers supporting the Whig cause. He was returned as Whig [[Member of Parliament]] for Southwark at the by-election on 12 January 1712,  although he actually finished 16 votes behind his opponent, [[George Mathews (MP)|Sir George Mathews]]. Mathews petitioned and as the committee reported several irregularities at the poll, the House ruled in favour of Mathews, and Halsey was unseated on 7 February 1712.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nHalsey became master of the Brewers Company in 1715. He was returned as MP for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] at a by-election on 30 November 1717 through the influence of his son-in-law, [[Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham|Sir Richard Temple, 4th Baronet]]. In the House he supported the administration. He was a governor of St Thomas\u2019 Hospital by 1719 and a director of the [[South Sea Company]] in 1721, holding both positions for the rest of his life. At the [[1722 British general election]] he was returned again in a contest for Southwark. His local interest was probably increased by the growing success of his brewery, and in 1724 he spent \u00a312,000 on the purchase of the [[Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire|manor of Stoke Poges]]. He was returned unopposed for Southwark at the [[1727 British general election]].<ref name = HOP2>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/halsey-edmund-1729| title= HALSEY, Edmund (d.1729), of Southwark, Surr. and Stoke Poges, Bucks. | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1715-1754)| accessdate = 2 January 2019 }}</ref>\n\nHalsey died in August 1729.

He enjoyed a rags-to-riches career, from working as a \u2018miller\u2019s boy\u2019 at St. Albans to becoming the owner of one of the largest breweries in the London area.\n\nHalsey left his home town of St Albans and went to London \u2018with 4s.6d. only in his pocket\u2019, and found work at James Child\u2019s [[Anchor Brewery]] in Southwark. He began by sweeping the yards, but was promoted to become clerk of the brewery\u2019s counting-house. He eventually married James Child\u2019s only daughter Anne Child on 17 October 1693, and became a partner in the business. By May 1696 he had already garnered enough wealth to loan \u00a31,000 to the crown. When Child died in September 1696,  he assumed complete control of the brewery.  By that time Halsey may have already become involved in local politics, for the elections committee reported in December 1696 on the testimony of a \u2018Mr Halsey\u2019 on a disputed election. He became Freeman of the [[Worshipful Company of Brewers|Brewers\u2019 Company]] in 1697.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/halsey-edmund-1729| title=HALSEY, Edmund (d. 1729), of St. Saviour\u2019s, Southwark, Surr. and Stoke Poges, Bucks. | publisher= History of Parliament Online (1690-1715)| accessdate = 8 March 2019 }}</ref> \n \nHalsey was put forward as a candidate in December 1711 for [[Southwark (UK Parliament constituency)|Southwark]], which had several brewers supporting the Whig cause. He was returned as Whig [[Member of Parliament]] for Southwark at the by-election on 12 January 1712,  although he actually finished 16 votes behind his opponent, [[George Mathews (MP)|Sir George Mathews]]. Mathews petitioned and as the committee reported several irregularities at the poll, the House ruled in favour of Mathews, and Halsey was unseated on 7 February 1712.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nHalsey became master of the Brewers Company in 1715. He was returned as MP for [[Buckingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckingham]] at a by-election on 30 November 1717 through the influence of his son-in-law, [[Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham|Sir Richard Temple, 4th Baronet]]. In the House he supported the administration. He was a governor of St Thomas\u2019 Hospital by 1719 and a director of the [[South Sea Company]] in 1721, holding both positions for the rest of his life. At the [[1722 British general election]] he was returned again in a contest for Southwark. His local interest was probably increased by the growing success of his brewery, and in 1724 he spent \u00a312,000 on the purchase of the [[Stoke Park, Buckinghamshire|manor of Stoke Poges]].

television series, produced in the United Kingdom by Sid Gentle Films for [[BBC America]]. The series follows [[Eve Polastri]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] investigator tasked with capturing psychopathic assassin [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]] ([[Jodie Comer]]); as the chase progresses, the two [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|develop a mutual obsession]]. Based on the ''[[Codename Villanelle|Villanelle]]'' novel series by [[Luke Jennings]], each of the show's series has featured a different female [[showrunner]]. [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]] was head writer of the first series, while [[Emerald Fennell]] took over for the second series. Suzanne Heathcote will serve as showrunner for the third series.\n\nThe show has been highly successful in both the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving critical acclaim for both the first and second series, particularly for its writing and the lead actresses' performances. The first series had unbroken weekly ratings increases, among adults especially. It has received several accolades, including a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]]. Both Oh and Comer have won multiple Best Actress awards for their roles, with [[Fiona Shaw]] winning one for Best Supporting Actress as Carolyn Martens.\n\nBy January 2020, ''Killing Eve'' had been renewed for both a third and a fourth series.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite web |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |title=''Killing Eve'' Renewed for Season 3 |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/08/killing-eve-renewed-season-3/ |website=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=8 April 2019 |location=United States |date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/03/killing-eve-renewed-season-4/|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 January 2020|title=Killing Eve renewed for season 4|last=Snierson|first=Dan}}</ref> The third series premiered on 12 April 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\nBored with her protection role within the British intelligence agencies, [[Eve Polastri]] is overly interested with female assassins, their psychologies, and their methods of killing. After brashly investigating behind-the-scenes in relation to a witness she is handling, she is fired from [[MI5]]; however, to her delight, she is recruited by a secret division within [[MI6]] chasing an international assassin who calls herself [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]]. Eve crosses paths with Villanelle and discovers that members within both of their secret circles may be more interconnected than she is comfortable with, but forms [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|an obsession with Villanelle that is more enthusiastically reciprocated]]. Both women begin to focus less on their initial missions in order to desperately seek more about the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/killing-eve/about|title=About the Show|website=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[Eve Polastri]], an agent with [[MI5]] (the UK's domestic [[counter-intelligence]] and security agency) who becomes obsessed with a notorious assassin and is recruited on an off-the-books basis to the foreign [[intelligence agency]] [[MI6]].\n* [[Jodie Comer]] as [[Villanelle (character)|Oksana Astankova / Villanelle]], a psychopathic, skilled assassin who becomes obsessed with the MI5 officer who is tracking her.\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Carolyn Martens, head of the Russia Section at [[MI6]].\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] as Konstantin Vasiliev, Villanelle's handler.\n* [[Owen McDonnell]] as Niko Polastri, Eve's English-Polish husband, a teacher.\n* Sean Delaney as Kenny Stowton, Carolyn's son, an ex-hacker who has been recruited by MI6.

He began his career with the [[Balmain Tigers]], where he played the majority of his career. He then moved to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] for two seasons, before finishing his career with a season at the [[North Queensland Cowboys]]. During his career he also represented [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] on 21 occasions and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] on 16 occasions.\n\n==Balmain==\nWhile attending Grantham High School<ref name=SC>{{cite web |url=https://www.schoolchoice.com.au/THE-HILLS-SPORTS-HIGH-SCHOOL/ |title=the Hills Sports High School |work=School Choice |publisher=Universal Magazines |date=2018 |access-date=7 July 2019 }}</ref> in [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] in Sydney, Brasher played for the [[Australia national schoolboys rugby league team|Australian Schoolboys team]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League |url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424 |accessdate=10 October 2008| publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> In 1989 [[Balmain Tigers]] coach [[Warren Ryan]] called up Brasher, still in high school, to make his first grade debut. Balmain reached the Grand Final that year, Brasher played in the centres, but they lost to the [[Canberra Raiders]] 19\u201314.\n\nDuring the 1992 season, Brasher played most of the season on the wing, and he was the joint top try-scorer in the premiership (along with [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests']] [[Mark Bell (rugby league)|Mark Bell]]) with 16 tries. In the post season he was selected at fullback in Australia's [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final]] victory over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1989/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html 1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season]], he went on the [[1994 Kangaroo tour]]. This was followed with selection for the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995 World Cup]], with again only ARL players selected. After losing the opening game of the tournament against [[England national rugby league team|England]] at Wembley, Australia reached the final, again playing England, after a 30-20 Semi-final win over New Zealand that went into overtime after the scores were locked up at 20-all after 80 minutes. On 28 October 1995 at Wembley Stadium, Australia won their 4th straight World Cup with a 16\u20138 win, with Brasher contributing the winning try in front of 66,540 fans.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1995/final/australia-vs-england.html 1995 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n1996 however was perhaps Brasher's finest year. Some considered him to be the best player in the world at this time. Brasher single-handedly carried a very weak Tigers side to within one win of a finals berth that year, and his Origin and Kangaroo performances continued to be exceptional.\n \nAfter the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] had become defunct and the reunification of the game had occurred in 1998, Brasher's hesitation over his future with the Tigers resulted in the club terminating negotiations, and he was forced to find a new club. He knocked back an offer of $500,000 p.a., only to then change his mind but find that the offer had been withdrawn not long after the dead line<ref>[https://anchor.fm/biggest-tiger/episodes/Stories-with-Tim-Brasher-eajk7t] SBFs Podcast: Stories With Tim Brasher </ref>. Brasher was in talks with the Canberra Raiders, but after talks with the club stalled, it was announced that Brasher had signed for the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]].\n\nBrasher enjoyed a very successful career with the Tigers playing in 185 games, which included 182 starts and 3 replacement appearances, and scoring 538 points, which included 82 tries and 105 goals. Brasher was named on the bench in the official Balmain Tigers ''Team of the Century''.\n\n==South Sydney==\nIn total he played two seasons for the Rabbitohs where he made 40 appearances and scored 14 tries, totaling 56 points. After the club was [[South Sydney Rabbitohs#The troubled 1990.27s and exclusion|excluded from the 2000 season]], Brasher was forced to find another club, and decided join the [[North Queensland Cowboys]].\n\n==North Queensland==\nBrasher moved to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in 2000, and was appointed captain in his first season with the club, in which he made 16 appearances, scoring four tries, and being voted ''Players Player of the Year''. However, after the 2000 season had ended he was injured during the off-season, which ruled him out of the entire 2001 season. The career-ending injury was widely reported at the time as a knee injury as a result of Brasher falling from a chair cleaning a fan. However, it has since been discovered that the injury was the result of an accident that occurred during a trail biking adventure with former Cowboy's halfback [[Nathan Fien]]. Much speculation still exists as to why the Cowboys chose to conceal the events of Brasher's injury. He decided to retire due to the injury.\n\nBrasher did however make a very brief comeback (albeit to English Rugby Union) when he filled in for a depleted Bath side during the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. Due to the attention that the World Cup drew in Australia, little attention was paid to this aspect of Brasher's career.\n\n==Representative career==\n===New South Wales===\nIn [[1992 State of Origin series|1992]], he was called up for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] squad. His impressive display in the second half of the third and deciding game of the series saw him pull off two try saving tackles on [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] and [[Mal Meninga]], as well as kicking two goals.\n\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, he was again called up to the New South Wales squad. After moving to South Sydney, his impressive form in a struggling Rabbitohs squad again earned him a call-up to the State of Origin side in 1998. After signing for the North Queensland Cowboys, Brasher was again selected for the New South Wales side in 2000. In all he represented New South Wales in 21 appearances, which included 20 starts and one replacement appearance. In his 21 appearances he scored three tries and nine goals, with a total of 30 points.\n\n===Australia===\nAfter his impressive State of Origin performance, as well as being the 1992 seasons leading try scorer for Balmain (while playing on the wing), Brasher was selected as the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] fullback in their [[1989\u20131992 Rugby League World Cup#Final|1992 World Cup Final]] victory over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Brasher beat out [[Newcastle Knights]] fullback [[Brad Godden]] for the vacant Australian fullback spot on the back of impressive big game displays in both the final State of Origin game that year, as well as with Balmain as an 18 year old in the 1989 Grand Final.\n\nBrasher, who had been moved to fullback at Balmain following [[Garry Jack]]'s departure from the club, again impressed at fullback for NSW 1993, but lost his place in the Australian side to Queensland fullback [[Dale Shearer]] (a long-time favorite of Australian coach [[Bob Fulton]]) for the three game test series against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. Shearer's place in the Australian side wasn't disputed though after impressive displays for Qld in the final two games of the Origin series.\n\nThe great form of [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] fullback [[Brett Mullins]] meant that Brasher, who again played fullback for NSW in the [[1994 State of Origin series|1994 Origin series]], could only make a place on the bench for his test debut against [[France national rugby league team|France]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]] in 1994, won 58-0 by the Kangaroos. At the end of the 1994 season he was selected as one of the fullbacks (along with Mullins) for the end of season [[1994 Kangaroo Tour|Kangaroo Tour]]. Brasher played 15 games on tour (six as a substitute), scoring six tries and kicking eleven goals. Brasher was a substitute in the final [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] test against Great Britain at [[Elland Road]] in [[Leeds]], as well as the test 74-0 win against France in [[B\u00e9ziers]], the final game of the tour.\n\nIn 1995, Brasher finally made the Australian fullback spot his own and he was selected there for all three tests against New Zealand in the [[1995 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] (only [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] loyal players were selected, which saw only three players, Brasher, [[Brad Fittler]] and [[Rod Wishart]] retain their places from the 1994 Kangaroo Tour).\n\nThis was followed with selection for the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995 World Cup]], with again only ARL players selected. With what many would label a 'second-string' team without the inclusion of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] players such as [[Laurie Daley]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Allan Langer]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]].

He began his career with the [[Balmain Tigers]], where he played the majority of his career. He then moved to the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] for two seasons, before finishing his career with a season at the [[North Queensland Cowboys]]. During his career he also represented [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] on 21 occasions and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australia]] on 16 occasions.\n\n==Balmain==\nWhile attending Grantham High School<ref name=SC>{{cite web |url=https://www.schoolchoice.com.au/THE-HILLS-SPORTS-HIGH-SCHOOL/ |title=the Hills Sports High School |work=School Choice |publisher=Universal Magazines |date=2018 |access-date=7 July 2019 }}</ref> in [[Seven Hills, New South Wales|Seven Hills]] in Sydney, Brasher played for the [[Australia national schoolboys rugby league team|Australian Schoolboys team]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=SportingPulse Homepage for Australian Secondary Schools Rugby League |url=http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=7-2130-0-0-0&sID=26424 |accessdate=10 October 2008| publisher=SportingPulse}}</ref> In 1989 [[Balmain Tigers]] coach [[Warren Ryan]] called up Brasher, still in high school, to make his first grade debut. Balmain reached the Grand Final that year, Brasher played in the centres, but they lost to the [[Canberra Raiders]] 19\u201314.\n\nDuring the 1992 season, Brasher played most of the season on the wing, and he was the joint top try-scorer in the premiership (along with [[Western Suburbs Magpies|Wests']] [[Mark Bell (rugby league)|Mark Bell]]) with 16 tries. In the post season he was selected at fullback in Australia's [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final]] victory over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1989/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html 1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[1994 NSWRL season]], he went on the [[1994 Kangaroo tour]]. This was followed with selection for the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995 World Cup]], with again only ARL players selected. After losing the opening game of the tournament against [[England national rugby league team|England]] at Wembley, Australia reached the final, again playing England, after a 30-20 Semi-final win over New Zealand that went into overtime after the scores were locked up at 20-all after 80 minutes. On 28 October 1995 at Wembley Stadium, Australia won their 4th straight World Cup with a 16\u20138 win, with Brasher contributing the winning try in front of 66,540 fans.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1995/final/australia-vs-england.html 1995 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n1996 however was perhaps Brasher's finest year. Some considered him to be the best player in the world at this time. Brasher single-handedly carried a very weak Tigers side to within one win of a finals berth that year, and his Origin and Kangaroo performances continued to be exceptional.\n \nAfter the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] had become defunct and the reunification of the game had occurred in 1998, Brasher's hesitation over his future with the Tigers resulted in the club terminating negotiations, and he was forced to find a new club. He knocked back an offer of $500,000 p.a., only to then change his mind but find that the offer had been withdrawn not long after the dead line<ref>[https://anchor.fm/biggest-tiger/episodes/Stories-with-Tim-Brasher-eajk7t]</ref>. Brasher was in talks with the Canberra Raiders, but after talks with the club stalled, it was announced that Brasher had signed for the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]].\n\nBrasher enjoyed a very successful career with the Tigers playing in 185 games, which included 182 starts and 3 replacement appearances, and scoring 538 points, which included 82 tries and 105 goals. Brasher was named on the bench in the official Balmain Tigers ''Team of the Century''.\n\n==South Sydney==\nIn total he played two seasons for the Rabbitohs where he made 40 appearances and scored 14 tries, totaling 56 points. After the club was [[South Sydney Rabbitohs#The troubled 1990.27s and exclusion|excluded from the 2000 season]], Brasher was forced to find another club, and decided join the [[North Queensland Cowboys]].\n\n==North Queensland==\nBrasher moved to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in 2000, and was appointed captain in his first season with the club, in which he made 16 appearances, scoring four tries, and being voted ''Players Player of the Year''. However, after the 2000 season had ended he was injured during the off-season, which ruled him out of the entire 2001 season. The career-ending injury was widely reported at the time as a knee injury as a result of Brasher falling from a chair cleaning a fan. However, it has since been discovered that the injury was the result of an accident that occurred during a trail biking adventure with former Cowboy's halfback [[Nathan Fien]]. Much speculation still exists as to why the Cowboys chose to conceal the events of Brasher's injury. He decided to retire due to the injury.\n\nBrasher did however make a very brief comeback (albeit to English Rugby Union) when he filled in for a depleted Bath side during the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]]. Due to the attention that the World Cup drew in Australia, little attention was paid to this aspect of Brasher's career.\n\n==Representative career==\n===New South Wales===\nIn [[1992 State of Origin series|1992]], he was called up for the [[New South Wales Rugby League team|New South Wales]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] squad. His impressive display in the second half of the third and deciding game of the series saw him pull off two try saving tackles on [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]] and [[Mal Meninga]], as well as kicking two goals.\n\nIn the 1993\u201394 season, he was again called up to the New South Wales squad. After moving to South Sydney, his impressive form in a struggling Rabbitohs squad again earned him a call-up to the State of Origin side in 1998. After signing for the North Queensland Cowboys, Brasher was again selected for the New South Wales side in 2000. In all he represented New South Wales in 21 appearances, which included 20 starts and one replacement appearance. In his 21 appearances he scored three tries and nine goals, with a total of 30 points.\n\n===Australia===\nAfter his impressive State of Origin performance, as well as being the 1992 seasons leading try scorer for Balmain (while playing on the wing), Brasher was selected as the [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] fullback in their [[1989\u20131992 Rugby League World Cup#Final|1992 World Cup Final]] victory over [[Great Britain Lions|Great Britain]] in front of the world record attendance for an international rugby league match of 73,631 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Brasher beat out [[Newcastle Knights]] fullback [[Brad Godden]] for the vacant Australian fullback spot on the back of impressive big game displays in both the final State of Origin game that year, as well as with Balmain as an 18 year old in the 1989 Grand Final.\n\nBrasher, who had been moved to fullback at Balmain following [[Garry Jack]]'s departure from the club, again impressed at fullback for NSW 1993, but lost his place in the Australian side to Queensland fullback [[Dale Shearer]] (a long-time favorite of Australian coach [[Bob Fulton]]) for the three game test series against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. Shearer's place in the Australian side wasn't disputed though after impressive displays for Qld in the final two games of the Origin series.\n\nThe great form of [[Canberra Raiders|Canberra]] fullback [[Brett Mullins]] meant that Brasher, who again played fullback for NSW in the [[1994 State of Origin series|1994 Origin series]], could only make a place on the bench for his test debut against [[France national rugby league team|France]] at [[Parramatta Stadium]] in 1994, won 58-0 by the Kangaroos. At the end of the 1994 season he was selected as one of the fullbacks (along with Mullins) for the end of season [[1994 Kangaroo Tour|Kangaroo Tour]]. Brasher played 15 games on tour (six as a substitute), scoring six tries and kicking eleven goals. Brasher was a substitute in the final [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] test against Great Britain at [[Elland Road]] in [[Leeds]], as well as the test 74-0 win against France in [[B\u00e9ziers]], the final game of the tour.\n\nIn 1995, Brasher finally made the Australian fullback spot his own and he was selected there for all three tests against New Zealand in the [[1995 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] (only [[Australian Rugby League|ARL]] loyal players were selected, which saw only three players, Brasher, [[Brad Fittler]] and [[Rod Wishart]] retain their places from the 1994 Kangaroo Tour).\n\nThis was followed with selection for the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995 World Cup]], with again only ARL players selected. With what many would label a 'second-string' team without the inclusion of the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] players such as [[Laurie Daley]], [[Bradley Clyde]], [[Allan Langer]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]]. After losing the opening game of the tournament against [[England national rugby league team|England]] at Wembley, Australia reached the final, again playing England, after a tense 30-20 Semi-final win over New Zealand that went into overtime after the scores were locked up at 20-all after 80 minutes. On 28 October 1995 at Wembley Stadium, Australia won their 4th straight World Cup with a 16\u20138 win, with Brasher contributing the winning try in front of 66,540 fans.\n\nBetween 1996 and 1998, Brasher was selected a further five times, against [[Fiji Bati|Fiji]], [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] (both 1996), Rest of the World (1997) and two Tests against New Zealand (1998). In total he represented his country on 16 occasions, scoring nine tries, totaling to 36 points.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stateoforigin.com.au/SOOgame/PlayerDetails.aspx?Pid=91 State of Origin Official website Rugby League Player Stats]\n\n{{Australia 1992 Rugby League World Cup Final squad}}\n{{1994 Kangaroo Tour squad}}\n{{Australia 1995 Rugby League World Cup Squad}}\n{{National Rugby League top try scorers}}\n{{Balmain Tigers Team of the Century}}\n{{North Queensland Cowboys captains}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brasher, Tim}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Australian rugby league players]]\n[[Category:Balmain Tigers players]]\n[[Category:North Queensland Cowboys players]]\n[[Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players]]\n[[Category:Australia national rugby league team players]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Rugby league fullbacks]]\n", "name_user": "Thebiggesttiger", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:I changed the name of a reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Brasher"}

Through the 1900s to 1950s, mainstream anthropology rejected visual methods. Ethnographic photography was still in use- less for analysis and more for context. Despite the move away from applied anthropology through the 1970s and 1980s, ethnographic filmmaking is still common. Still marginal, Visual methods slowly became a tradition and exploded when reflexive research made a dramatic turn.<ref name=\"van den Scott, L.-J. K., 2018\">van den Scott, L.-J. K. (2018).

(2019). Creating Space for Visual Ethnography in Educational Research. Online Submission, 23(2), 1\u201315.</ref> explained that as images are present in society their illustration should be included in the studies of society, and that study of images in the accumulation of data may reveal sociological understanding that may not be accessible. Images can be the central part of analysis of social-cultural views and perceptions created by researchers, and/or participants. According to Van Maanen<ref name=\"Barrantes-Elizondo, L.,2019\">Barrantes-Elizondo, L. (2019). Creating Space for Visual Ethnography in Educational Research. Online Submission, 23(2), 1\u201315.</ref> in using visual ethnography as a qualitative research methodology, \u201cthe researcher studies an entire cultural or social group on its natural setting, closely examining customs and ways of life, with the aim of describing and interpreting cultural patterns of behaviour, values, and practices\".\n\n==Research into \u201cVisual Ethnography\u201d Area==\n\nAfter looking at two books- one by Savin-Baden,<ref>Savin-Baden, M., & Major, C. H. (2013). Qualitative research: the essential guide to theory and practice. London: Routledge.</ref> and another by Creswell<ref>Creswell, J.W. and Poth, C.N. (2018) Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design Choosing among Five Approaches. 4th Edition, SAGE Publications, Inc., Thousand Oaks.</ref> on qualitative research, I found that the qualitative research methodology starts with the research types or approaches, then comes data collection and analysis at the end which includes grounded theory, ethnography, phenomenology, and narrative research approaches. There were several similar methodological topic areas mentioned in those books: Artifacts, Arts-based research, Autobiography, Autoethnography, Case study, Ethnographic research, Feminist research, Hermeneutics, Interpretive, Narrative research, Observations, Phenomenological research, triangulation of data, Thick description, Verisimilitude, Virtual artefacts, and etc. I found Visual methodologies/ visual-based methodologies, Visualization, and Visual data as key words while I was searching for visual ethnography in those books. Among those topics, I chose \u201cvisual ethnography\u201d. I was introduced to \u201cvisual data\u201d in my Qualitative Research Methodology course which I think gives a new dimension of the study. While searching articles published in the last ten years on \u201cvisual ethnography\u201d through the UMass Lowell Library, I found that visual ethnography is being used not only in the education field , but in public health, business, social science, and different science fields. Ethnography as a separate field was prominent.\n\n==Current state of affairs regarding Visual Ethnography==\n\nSarah Pink<ref name=\"Pink, 2013\">Pink, S. (2013). Doing visual ethnography. Thousands Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref> and many other researchers focused on visuals as data collection method through photography as an example, as well as data analysis through sociological examination of traditions. Visuals methods are used to disseminate knowledge such as photographs at a conference. Visuals are also used to collect data and as a storytelling mechanism.<ref name=\"van den Scott, L.-J.

Through the 1900s to 1950s, mainstream anthropology rejected visual methods. Ethnographic photography was still in use- less for analysis and more for context. Despite the move away from applied anthropology through the 1970s and 1980s, ethnographic filmmaking is still common. Still marginal, Visual methods slowly became a tradition and exploded when reflexive research made a dramatic turn.<ref name=\"van den Scott, L.-J. K., 2018\">van den Scott, L.-J. K. (2018).

(2019). Creating Space for Visual Ethnography in Educational Research. Online Submission, 23(2), 1\u201315.</ref> explained that as images are present in society their illustration should be included in the studies of society, and that study of images in the accumulation of data may reveal sociological understanding that may not be accessible. Images can be the central part of analysis of social-cultural views and perceptions created by researchers, and/or participants. According to Van Maanen<ref name=\"Barrantes-Elizondo, L.,2019\">Barrantes-Elizondo, L. (2019). Creating Space for Visual Ethnography in Educational Research. Online Submission, 23(2), 1\u201315.</ref> in using visual ethnography as a qualitative research methodology, \u201cthe researcher studies an entire cultural or social group on its natural setting, closely examining customs and ways of life, with the aim of describing and interpreting cultural patterns of behaviour, values, and practices\". \n\n==Research into \u201cVisual Ethnography\u201d Area==\n\nAfter looking at two books- one by Savin-Baden<ref>Savin-Baden, M., & Major, C. H. (2013). Qualitative research: the essential guide to theory and practice. London: Routledge.</ref>, and another by Creswell<ref>Creswell, J.W. and Poth, C.N. (2018) Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design Choosing among Five Approaches. 4th Edition, SAGE Publications, Inc., Thousand Oaks.</ref> on qualitative research, I found that the qualitative research methodology starts with the research types or approaches, then comes data collection and analysis at the end which includes grounded theory, ethnography, phenomenology, and narrative research approaches. There were several similar methodological topic areas mentioned in those books: Artifacts, Arts-based research, Autobiography, Autoethnography, Case study, Ethnographic research, Feminist research, Hermeneutics, Interpretive, Narrative research, Observations, Phenomenological research, triangulation of data, Thick description, Verisimilitude, Virtual artefacts, and etc. I found Visual methodologies/ visual-based methodologies, Visualization, and Visual data as key words while I was searching for visual ethnography in those books. Among those topics, I chose \u201cvisual ethnography\u201d. I was introduced to \u201cvisual data\u201d in my Qualitative Research Methodology course which I think gives a new dimension of the study. While searching articles published in the last ten years on \u201cvisual ethnography\u201d through the UMass Lowell Library, I found that visual ethnography is being used not only in the education field , but in public health, business, social science, and different science fields. Ethnography as a separate field was prominent. \n\n==Current state of affairs regarding Visual Ethnography==\n\nSarah Pink<ref name=\"Pink, 2013>Pink, S. (2013). Doing visual ethnography. Thousands Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref> and many other researchers focused on visuals as data collection method through photography as an example, as well as data analysis through sociological examination of traditions. Visuals methods are used to disseminate knowledge such as photographs at a conference. Visuals are also used to collect data and as a storytelling mechanism.<ref name=\"van den Scott, L.-J. K., 2018\">van den Scott, L.-J. K. (2018). Visual methods in ethnography.

The same rule applies to visual ethnography. There are visual method interest groups in both the American Sociological Association and the Canadian Sociological Association.\n\n==Significant contributors==\n\nSarah Pink published \u201cDoing Visual Ethnography\u201d in 2001, and the most recent version was written in 2013<ref name=\"Pink, 2013>Pink, S. (2013). Doing visual ethnography. Thousands Oaks, CA: SAGE.</ref>. Many writers working in the field of visual ethnography make reference to her work.
