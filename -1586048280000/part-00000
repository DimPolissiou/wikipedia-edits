{"title_page": "History of nanotechnology", "text_new": "{{Nanotech}}\n\nThe '''history of nanotechnology''' traces the development of the concepts and experimental work falling under the broad category of [[nanotechnology]].  Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central  concepts happened over a longer period of time. The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 and the discovery of [[fullerene]]s in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.  The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its [[Implications of nanotechnology|potential implications]] as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and with governments moving to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology.  The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications of nanotechnology]], although these were limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] rather than the [[Disruptive technology|transformative]] applications envisioned by the field.\n\n== Early uses of nanomaterials ==\nThe earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to [[carbon nanotubes]], [[cementite]] [[nanowires]] found in the microstructure of [[wootz steel]] manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanderson, Katharine |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html |title=Sharpest cut from nanotube sword |journal=Nature News |date=2006-11-15 |doi=10.1038/news061113-11}}</ref>\n\nAlthough nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they were used by [[artisan]]s as far back as the ninth century in [[Mesopotamia]] for creating a [[Lusterware|glittering]] effect on the surface of pots.<ref name=\"reiss\">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiFMPmXSsLUC&pg=SA2-PA1|title=Handbook of Nanophysics: Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots|last2=Hutten|first2=Andreas|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420075458|editor-last=Sattler|editor-first=Klaus D.|pages=2\u20131|chapter=Magnetic Nanoparticles|last1=Reiss|first1=Gunter}}</ref><ref name=\"khan\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&pg=PA328|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439820094|page=328}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, [[pottery]] from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter.

These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding [[copper]] and [[silver]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[oxide]]s together with [[vinegar]], [[ochre]], and [[clay]] on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the [[Muslim world]]. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.<ref name=\"khan\" /><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1e79xqbRqEEC&pg=PA150|title=Ceramics|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1984|isbn=978-0-8122-1156-6|author=Rawson, Philip S.}}</ref>\n\n== Conceptual origins ==\n===Richard Feynman===\n{{main article|There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom}}\n[[File:Feynman at Los Alamos.jpg|thumb|Richard Feynman gave a 1959 talk which many years later inspired the conceptual foundations of nanotechnology.]]\n\nThe American [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] lectured, \"[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]],\" at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting at [[Caltech]] on December 29, 1959, which is often held to have provided inspiration for the field of [[nanotechnology]]. Feynman had described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, [[surface tension]] and [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals attraction]] would become more important.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gribbin |first1=John |last2=Gribbin |first2=Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Dutton |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452276314/page/170 170] |isbn=978-0-452-27631-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452276314/page/170 }}</ref>\n\nAfter Feynman's death, a scholar studying the historical development of nanotechnology has concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a [[cultural anthropologist]] at the [[University of South Carolina]], found that the published versions of Feynman\u2019s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] was invented in 1981.  Subsequently, interest in \u201cPlenty of Room\u201d in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves via computer control instead of control by a human operator; and in a cover article headlined \"Nanotechnology\",<ref>{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= \"Nanotechnology\" / \"Tinytech\" | page= 56 |journal=Omni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref> published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]''.

He also first published the term \"[[grey goo]]\" to describe what might happen if a hypothetical self-replicating machine, capable of independent operation, were constructed and released.

In the article, he argues that \"Our most powerful 21st-century technologies \u2014 [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] \u2014 are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]].\" Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]]. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the [[nuclear bomb]], were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials. He also voices concern about increasing computer power. His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such [[dystopian]] scenarios as [[cybernetic revolt|robot rebellion]]. He notably quotes the [[Unabomber]] on this topic.  After the publication of the article, Bill Joy suggested assessing technologies to gauge their implicit dangers, as well as having scientists refuse to work on technologies that have the potential to cause harm.\n\nIn the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Science and Technology Policy Yearbook 2001 article titled ''A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists'', Bill Joy was criticized for having technological tunnel vision on his prediction, by failing to consider social factors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031231160458/http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/ch4.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 December 2003 |title=A Response to Bill Joy and the Doom-and-Gloom Technofuturists |date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=12 May 2011 |author=Brown, John Seely and Duguid, Paul }}</ref>  In [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'', he questioned the regulation of potentially dangerous technology, asking \"Should we tell the millions of people afflicted with cancer and other devastating conditions that we are canceling the development of all bioengineered treatments because there is a risk that these same technologies may someday be used for malevolent purposes?\".\n\n===''Prey''===\n\n{{Main article|Prey (novel)}}\n\n''Prey'' is a 2002 novel by [[Michael Crichton]] which features an artificial swarm of nanorobots which develop intelligence and threaten their human inventors.

Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the \u201cfat fingers problem\" and the \"sticky fingers problem\u201d, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler\u2019s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.\n\nSmalley first argued that \"fat fingers\" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. He believed these would exclude the possibility of \"molecular assemblers\" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.\n\nSmalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with \"molecular assemblers\" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.<ref name=\"counterpoint\"/>\n\nDrexler and coworkers responded to these two issues<ref name=\"smalleyresponse\"/> in a 2001 publication.  Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Drexler maintained that both were [[straw man]] arguments, and in the case of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, \"...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles...\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|title=Of Chemistry, Nanobots, and Policy|url=http://crnano.org/Debate.htm|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=December 2003}}</ref> Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be.  Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' carried a 4-part debate.<ref name=\"counterpoint\"/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] spends four pages in his book 'The Singularity Is Near' to showing that Richard Smalley's arguments are not valid, and disputing them point by point.

The report contains an annex (appendix) on [[grey goo]], which cites a weaker variation of [[Richard Smalley]]'s contested argument against molecular manufacturing.

His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz.  This study concludes that much of what is sold as \u201cnanotechnology\u201d is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a \u201cnanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like\u201d which will \u201cend up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes.\" Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a \"nano bubble\" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1822/ |access-date=2020-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028150837/http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1822%2F |archive-date=2017-10-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCommercial [[nanoelectronic]] [[semiconductor device fabrication]] began in the 2010s.

Although nanotechnology is a relatively recent development in scientific research, the development of its central  concepts happened over a longer period of time. The emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was caused by the convergence of experimental advances such as the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] in 1981 and the discovery of [[fullerene]]s in 1985, with the elucidation and popularization of a conceptual framework for the goals of nanotechnology beginning with the 1986 publication of the book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.  The field was subject to growing public awareness and controversy in the early 2000s, with prominent debates about both its [[Implications of nanotechnology|potential implications]] as well as the feasibility of the applications envisioned by advocates of [[molecular nanotechnology]], and with governments moving to promote and [[Funding of science|fund research]] into nanotechnology.  The early 2000s also saw the beginnings of commercial [[List of nanotechnology applications|applications of nanotechnology]], although these were limited to bulk applications of [[nanomaterials]] rather than the [[Disruptive technology|transformative]] applications envisioned by the field.\n\n== Early uses of nanomaterials ==\nThe earliest evidence of the use and applications of nanotechnology can be traced back to [[carbon nanotubes]], [[cementite]] [[nanowires]] found in the microstructure of [[wootz steel]] manufactured in ancient India from the time period of 600 BC and exported globally.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sanderson, Katharine |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/061113/full/news061113-11.html |title=Sharpest cut from nanotube sword |journal=Nature News |date=2006-11-15 |doi=10.1038/news061113-11}}</ref>\n\nAlthough nanoparticles are associated with modern science, they were used by [[artisan]]s as far back as the ninth century in [[Mesopotamia]] for creating a [[Lusterware|glittering]] effect on the surface of pots.<ref name=\"reiss\">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiFMPmXSsLUC&pg=SA2-PA1|title=Handbook of Nanophysics: Nanoparticles and Quantum Dots|last2=Hutten|first2=Andreas|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781420075458|editor-last=Sattler|editor-first=Klaus D.|pages=2\u20131|chapter=Magnetic Nanoparticles|last1=Reiss|first1=Gunter}}</ref><ref name=\"khan\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&pg=PA328|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|publisher=CRC Press|year=2012|isbn=9781439820094|page=328}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, [[pottery]] from the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored metallic glitter.

These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding [[copper]] and [[silver]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[oxide]]s together with [[vinegar]], [[ochre]], and [[clay]] on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the [[Muslim world]]. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold.

Feynman had described a process by which the ability to manipulate individual atoms and molecules might be developed, using one set of precise tools to build and operate another proportionally smaller set, so on down to the needed scale. In the course of this, he noted, scaling issues would arise from the changing magnitude of various physical phenomena: gravity would become less important, [[surface tension]] and [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals attraction]] would become more important.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gribbin |first1=John |last2=Gribbin |first2=Mary |title=Richard Feynman: A Life in Science |publisher=Dutton |year=1997 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452276314/page/170 170] |isbn=978-0-452-27631-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780452276314/page/170 }}</ref>\n\nAfter Feynman's death, a scholar studying the historical development of nanotechnology has concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a [[cultural anthropologist]] at the [[University of South Carolina]], found that the published versions of Feynman\u2019s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] was invented in 1981.  Subsequently, interest in \u201cPlenty of Room\u201d in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s.  This is probably because the term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book, [[Engines of Creation|''Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology'']], which took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves via computer control instead of control by a human operator; and in a cover article headlined \"Nanotechnology\",<ref>{{cite journal |first= Fred |last=Hapgood |date=November 1986|title= \"Nanotechnology\" / \"Tinytech\" | page= 56 |journal=Omni}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Drexler|first=Eric|title=The promise that launched the field of nanotechnology|url=http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|publisher=Metamodern: The Trajectory of Technology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=15 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714075738/http://metamodern.com/2009/12/15/when-a-million-readers-first-encountered-nanotechnology/|archivedate=14 July 2011}}</ref> published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]''.

In the article, he argues that \"Our most powerful 21st-century technologies \u2014 [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology|nanotech]] \u2014 are threatening to make humans an [[endangered species]].\" Joy argues that developing technologies provide a much greater danger to humanity than any technology before it has ever presented. In particular, he focuses on [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]]. He argues that 20th-century technologies of destruction, such as the [[nuclear bomb]], were limited to large governments, due to the complexity and cost of such devices, as well as the difficulty in acquiring the required materials.

His worry is that computers will eventually become more intelligent than we are, leading to such [[dystopian]] scenarios as [[cybernetic revolt|robot rebellion]].

Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the \u201cfat fingers problem\" and the \"sticky fingers problem\u201d, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler\u2019s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.\n\nSmalley first argued that \"fat fingers\" made MNT impossible. He later argued that nanomachines would have to resemble chemical enzymes more than Drexler's assemblers and could only work in water. He believed these would exclude the possibility of \"molecular assemblers\" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.\n\nSmalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with \"molecular assemblers\" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.<ref name=\"counterpoint\"/>\n\nDrexler and coworkers responded to these two issues<ref name=\"smalleyresponse\"/> in a 2001 publication.  Drexler and colleagues noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Drexler maintained that both were [[straw man]] arguments, and in the case of enzymes, Prof. Klibanov wrote in 1994, \"...using an enzyme in organic solvents eliminates several obstacles...\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|title=Of Chemistry, Nanobots, and Policy|url=http://crnano.org/Debate.htm|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=12 May 2011|date=December 2003}}</ref> Drexler also addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be.  Drexler had difficulty in getting Smalley to respond, but in December 2003, ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' carried a 4-part debate.<ref name=\"counterpoint\"/>\n\n[[Ray Kurzweil]] spends four pages in his book 'The Singularity Is Near' to showing that Richard Smalley's arguments are not valid, and disputing them point by point.  Kurzweil ends by stating that Drexler's visions are very practicable and even happening already.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|title=The Singularity Is Near|year=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/singularityisnea00kurz/page/193 193\u2013196]|isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|url=https://archive.org/details/singularityisnea00kurz/page/193}}</ref>\n\n===Royal Society report on the implications of nanotechnology===\n\n{{further|Implications of nanotechnology#Studies on the implications of nanotechnology|l1=Studies on the implications of nanotechnology}}\n\nThe [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]'s 2004 report on the implications of nanoscience and nanotechnologies<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering |title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties |date=July 2004 |url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |accessdate=13 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703013640/http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm |archive-date=3 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was inspired by [[Prince Charles]]' concerns about [[nanotechnology]], including [[molecular manufacturing]]. However, the report spent almost no time on molecular manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Society in Denial|url=http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2004/08/royal_society_i.html|publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology|accessdate=13 May 2011|date=31 July 2004}}</ref>  In fact, the word \"[[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]]\" appears only once in the body of the report (in passing), and \"molecular manufacturing\" or \"[[molecular nanotechnology]]\" not at all.  The report covers various risks of nanoscale technologies, such as nanoparticle toxicology.  It also provides a useful overview of several nanoscale fields. The report contains an annex (appendix) on [[grey goo]], which cites a weaker variation of [[Richard Smalley]]'s contested argument against molecular manufacturing. It concludes that there is no evidence that autonomous, self replicating nanomachines will be developed in the foreseeable future, and suggests that regulators should be more concerned with issues of nanoparticle toxicology.\n\n== Initial commercial applications ==\n{{further|List of nanotechnology applications}}\n\nThe early 2000s saw the beginnings of the use of nanotechnology in commercial products, although most applications are limited to the bulk use of passive [[nanomaterials]].  Examples include [[titanium dioxide]] and [[zinc oxide]] [[nanoparticle]]s in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; [[silver nanoparticles]] in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as [[Silver Nano]]; [[carbon nanotube]]s for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nanotechnology Information Center: Properties, Applications, Research, and Safety Guidelines|url=http://www.americanelements.com/nanotech.htm|publisher=[[American Elements]]|accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>  As of March 10, 2011, the [[Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies]] estimated that over 1300 manufacturer-identified nanotech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3\u20134 per week.<ref>{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.nanotechproject.org/inventories/consumer/analysis_draft/ |publisher=The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies |title=Analysis: This is the first publicly available on-line inventory of nanotechnology-based consumer products |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Science Foundation]] funded researcher David Berube to study the field of nanotechnology. His findings are published in the monograph Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz.  This study concludes that much of what is sold as \u201cnanotechnology\u201d is in fact a recasting of straightforward materials science, which is leading to a \u201cnanotech industry built solely on selling nanotubes, nanowires, and the like\u201d which will \u201cend up with a few suppliers selling low margin products in huge volumes.\" Further applications which require actual manipulation or arrangement of nanoscale components await further research. Though technologies branded with the term 'nano' are sometimes little related to and fall far short of the most ambitious and transformative technological goals of the sort in molecular manufacturing proposals, the term still connotes such ideas. According to Berube, there may be a danger that a \"nano bubble\" will form, or is forming already, from the use of the term by scientists and entrepreneurs to garner funding, regardless of interest in the transformative possibilities of more ambitious and far-sighted work.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berube |first=David |title=Nano-Hype: The Truth Behind the Nanotechnology Buzz |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2006 |url=http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1822/ |access-date=2020-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028150837/http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=1822%2F |archive-date=2017-10-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCommercial [[nanoelectronic]] [[semiconductor device fabrication]] began in the 2010s.

The Roma find issues with documenting their own exact origin due to a lack of finding specific records left by ancestors. Their history however is retold by clan family customs, such as singing and storytelling. \nRecords cannot identify exactly why the Roma migrated from India; there are a number of possible motives, such as famine and military invasions on the part of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BCE) and/or [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (971-1030 CE).\n\n== Names ==\nThe Romani people are today found in many countries. Typically, Romani adopt given names that are common in the country of their residence. Seldom do modern Romani use traditional names from their own language, such as Papush, Luludi, Patrin, etc. It is the only Indo-Aryan language that has been spoken exclusively around Europe since the Middle Ages. Speakers use many terms for their language. They generally refer to their language as ''\u0159omani \u010dhib'' translated as \u2018the Romani language\u2019, or ''\u0159omanes'', \u2018in a Rom way\u2019. The English term, Romani, has been used by scholars since the 19th Century, where previously they had used the term 'Gypsy Language'.\n\n== Family and life stages ==\n[[File:Romany girl from cz 2005.jpg|thumb|A bridesmaid at a Romani wedding in [[Brno]], Czech Republic (2006 photograph)]]\nTraditionally, Roma place a high value on the [[extended family]].\n\n===Marriage and controversies===\n\nMarriage in Romani society underscores the importance of family and demonstrates ties between different groups, often transnationally.

Parents rarely force a particular spouse on their child, although being married by your mid-twenties is generally regarded as the norm.<ref name=\"Silverman\"/> School, weddings, and other events are also popular environments for finding a prospective spouse; however, they should be supervised by an adult. With the emergence of [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[mobile phones]], and education of women becoming more prominent, traditional and conservative views are becoming less rigid. In some Romani groups, for example the [[Finnish Kale|Finnish Roma]], the idea of marriage is ignored altogether.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Weyrauch| first1=Walter.

Men and women often marry young. The Romani practice of [[child marriage]] has generated controversy in many countries. In 2003, one of the many self-styled Romani \"kings\", Ilie Tortic\u0103, prohibited marriage before the parties were of legal age in their country of residence. A Romani patriarch, [[Florin Cioab\u0103]], ran afoul of Romanian authorities in late 2003 when he married off his youngest daughter, Ana-Maria, at the age of twelve, well below the legal [[marriageable age]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3168638.stm | title=Roma rivalry over child bride ban |last=Brabant |first=Malcolm |authorlink=Malcolm Brabant |date=6 October 2003 |website=[[BBC News Online]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Bride kidnapping]] is thought to be a traditional Romani practice.

Fingernails and toenails must be filed with an emery board; cutting them with a clipper is taboo.\n\nClothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are washed in a different place.\n\nChildbirth is considered \"impure\" and must occur outside the dwelling place; the mother is considered \"impure\" for 40 days.\n\nDeath is seen as \"impure\" and affects the whole family of the dead, who may remain \"impure\" for a period after the death; usually private items of the dead are considered to be impure and are to be buried in his/her grave or given to non-Romani poor people. \"Impure\" is not literal but rather linked to cleanliness.\n\nThis practice of burial (rather than cremation) is also found amongst the nomadic people of Western India to this day. Notable deviations from this practice exist among German Roma and British [[Romanichal]], the latter holding a tradition of cremation similar to that of some Hindu cultures. Up until the mid-20th century they invariably burned the deceased person and all their earthly belongings, including the dwelling place, all which was considered spiritually impure.

There is an element of impurity placed upon both the mother and father after the mother gives birth.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This impurity is lessened if the child is a male and the family is considered \u201clucky\u201d. Traditionally, the couple will live with the father of the groom until their first child is born.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Romani people place high value on extended family so godparents, along with this other family, are active in the child\u2019s life to ensure its well-being. The child\u2019s parents often do not have an input in what their child eats throughout the day, so the child relies on eating whatever happens to come their way.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Moral values ==\n\n===Romanipen===\n''Romanipen'' (also ''romanypen'', ''romanipe'', ''romanype'', ''romanimos'', ''romaimos'', ''romaniya'') is a complicated concept of [[Romani people|Romani]] philosophy encompassing totality of the Romani spirit, culture, [[Kris (Romani court)|law]], being a Rom, a set of Romani strains.\n\nAn ethnic Rom is considered to be a [[Gadjo (non-Romani)]] in Romani [[society]] if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a Gadjo, usually an [[Adoption|adopted]] child, may be considered to be a Rom if he has Romanipen. As a concept, Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a [[Cultural framework|framework of culture]] than simply an adherence to historically received rules.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Saul| first1=Nicholas |first2=Susan| last2=Tebbut |title=The role of the Romanies: images and counter-images of 'Gypsies'/Romanies in European cultures|editor=Nicholas Saul, Susan Tebbutt|publisher=Liverpool University Press| year=2005| pages=218| isbn= 978-0-85323-689-4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=AQw6qOCNj-UC&pg=PA218&dq=romanipen&cd=7#v=onepage&q=romanipen&f=false| accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>\n\nSignificant changes in Romani culture following the [[Second World War]] have been attributed to the suspension of these social norms, as strict rules relating to food and contact with certain classes of people broke down. This period also coincided with a perceived loss of authority invested in traditional leaders, the primary maintainers of Romanipen.<ref>{{cite book|last= Guy|first=Will |title=Between past and future: the Roma of Central and Eastern Europe|editor=Will Guy |publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|year=2001|pages=254|isbn= 978-1-902806-07-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lpBHAM3qafwC&pg=PA254&dq=romanipen&cd=8#v=onepage&q=romanipen&f=false|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Furthermore, the Roma who found themselves under Soviet control during the war, while deported to the east of the Urals and often persecuted, were generally left alone to follow their orthodox practices and thus preserved strict interpretations of Romanipen. However, the Roma who lived in other countries of eastern Europe, in the face of widespread discrimination and society's attempts at forced assimilation, often had to compromise their strict interpretation of the customs just in order to survive. As a result, the whole concept of Romanipen became interpreted differently among various Roma groups.\n\n=== Being a part of Romani society ===\nA considerable punishment for a Rom is expulsion from Romani society. An expelled person is considered to be \"contaminated\" and is shunned by other Romanis.\n\nTravelling Roma left symbols or signposts for their traveling fellows, known as ''patrin''s (an old word for leaf).\n\n=== Romani Code ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n[[Kris (Romani court)|Romani Code]], or ''Romano Zakono'', is the most important part of Romanipen. It is a set of rules for Romani life.\n\nThough Romani ethnic groups have different sets of rules, some rules are common for all. Those rules are considered to be the Romani Code, and rules that differ are called \"customs\". Oral Romani cultures are most likely to adhere to the Romani code, these communities are geographically spread.<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\">{{cite book|last1=Matras|first1=Yaron|title=The Romani Gypsies|date=6 January 2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674368385|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YfQ9BQAAQBAJ&dq=the+romani+code|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> There are proverbs about the Romani Code and customs, such as:\n\n* There exist as many customs as there are Romani groups. (''Kitsyk Roma, dakitsyk obychaye'' in [[Ruska Roma]]'s dialect)\n* There are many Romani groups, but only one Law. (''Romen isy but, a Zakono yekh'' in Ruska Roma's and [[Kaldarash]] dialects)\n\nRules of Romani Code describe relationships inside the Romani community and set limits for customs, behavior and other aspects of life.\n\nThe Romani Code is not written; the Romani people keep it alive in oral tradition.\n\nThe ''[[Kris (Romani court)|kris]]'' is a traditional institution for upholding and enforcing the Romani Code.\n\nThe code can be summarised in pillars; the main pillar representing the polar ideas of ''baxt'' (pronounced \"baht\") meaning honour and ''lad\u017e'' (pronounced \"Ladge\") meaning shame. Linking to the article above in reference to \"purity\" they can also represent the idea of being \"pure\" or \"clean\" and \"impure\" and \"unclean\"<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\"/> It is honourable, in Romani culture, to celebrate ''baxt'' by being generous and displaying your success to the public. The focus on generosity means sharing food is of great importance to some groups of Roma. Making lavish meals to share with other Romani visitors is commonplace and in some cases not having food to share is considered shameful.<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\"/>\n\n===Faith and religion===\n[[File:Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer Sarah.jpg|thumb|The cult of [[Saint Sarah]] in the shrine of [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]], Southern France is a devotion associated with Catholic Romanies.]]\n\n====Hinduism====\nWhile in [[India]], the Romani people followed the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religion. This theory is supported by the Romani word for \"cross\", ''trushul'', which is the word which describes [[Shiva]]'s [[trident]] ([[Trishula|Trishul]]). A Hindu foundation means that the concept of ''kuntari'', a universal balance, is central to the people's spirituality. ''Kuntari'' means that all things belong in the universe according to their natural place. However, animals such as the flightless hen and frogs, an animal with the ability to negotiate land and water, are considered to be out of balance and are, therefore, inherently unlucky. Consequently, Roma avoid hens' eggs and frogs. Roma believe in the idea of \"pollution\", whereby the human body is vulnerable to pollution following the breaking of certain taboos\u2014pollution leads to a person becoming out of balance, like the frog and the hen.\n\nIf such taboos are broken, restoration of one's purity can only be attained through a trial overseen by a tribunal of Romani elders. This tribunal determines whether a person is guilty or innocent and, in the case of the former, the subject of the trial must complete a period of isolation for the purpose of eventual reinstatement (in particularly severe cases of pollution, permanent estrangement has occurred, but this is apparently rare in the modern era). Such pollution taboos do not apply until a Rom has undergone [[puberty]].<ref name=\"Cac\">{{cite web|title=Roma|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Roma.html#b |work=Countries and their Cultures|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=26 December 2012|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nMany branches of Christianity have been adopted by Roma.<ref>{{cite web|title=Restless Beings Project: Roma Engage|url=http://www.restlessbeings.org/projects/roma-gypsies|work=restlessbeings|publisher=Restless Beings |accessdate=26 December 2012|year=2008\u20132012}}</ref>\n\n====Deities and saints====\n[[Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla|Blessed Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla]] is considered a patron saint of the Romani people in Roman Catholicism.<ref>{{cite web|title=BLESSED CEFERINO GIMENEZ MALLA 1861-1936 |url=http://www.savior.org/saints/malla.htm |work=Saviour.org \u2013 Visit the Saviour|publisher=Voveo Marketing Group |accessdate=26 December 2012|date=December 2012}}</ref> [[Saint Sarah]], or Kali Sara, has been revered as a patron saint in the same manner as the Blessed Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla, but a transition occurred in the 21st century, whereby Kali Sara is understood as an Indian deity brought by the refugee ancestors of the Romani people, thereby removing any Christian association.

The Roma continue to practice \"[[Shaktism]]\", a practice with origins in India, whereby a female consort is required for the worship of a god. Adherence to this practice means that for the Romani who worship a Christian God, prayer is conducted through the [[Virgin Mary]], or her mother, [[Saint Anne]]. Shaktism continues over 1,000 years after the people's separation from India.<ref name=\"Cac\" />\n\nRomani elders serve as spiritual leaders; there are no priests, churches, or bibles among the Roma, the only exception being the Pentecostal Roma.<ref name=\"Cac\" />\n\n====Balkans====\nFor the Romani communities that have resided in the Balkans for centuries, often referred to as \"Turkish Gypsies\", the following histories apply for religious beliefs:\n\n* Bulgaria: In northwestern Bulgaria and Sofia and Kyustendil, Islam has been the dominant religion; however, in the independent Bulgarian state, a major conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity has occurred.

The work they perform is seen as more legitimate, and they have begun to obtain legal permits for commercial activities.<ref name=\"Bernal\" />\n\nEvangelical Romani churches exist in every country where Roma are settled. The movement is particularly strong in France and Spain; there are more than 1,000 Romani churches (known as \"Filadelfia\" or simply ''el culto'') in Spain, with almost 100 in [[Madrid]] alone.

Travellers argued in response that thousands of retrospective planning permissions are granted in Britain in cases involving non-Romani applicants each year and that statistics showed that 90% of planning applications by Roma and travellers were initially refused by local councils, compared with a national average of 20% for other applicants, potentially disproving claims of preferential treatment favouring Roma. They also argued that the root of the problem was that many traditional stopping-places had been barricaded off and that legislation passed by the previous Conservative government had effectively criminalised their communities by removing local authorities' responsibility to provide sites, thus leaving the travellers with no option but to purchase unregistered new sites themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series8/week_three.shtml |title=This Week's Highlights: Gypsies |date=19 September 2005 |website=[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]] |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in the United States hold regular conferences on the Roma and similar nomadic groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gypsies: the Usual Suspects |author=Hector Becerra |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-gypsy30jan30,0,7784207.story |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=30 January 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413203211/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-gypsy30jan30,0,7784207.story |archivedate=April 13, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn Denmark, there was much controversy when the city of Helsing\u00f8r decided to put all Romani students in special classes in its public schools.

However, in some cases\u2014notably the [[Kalderash]] clan in [[Romania]], who work as traditional [[coppersmith]]s\u2014they have prospered. Although some Roma still embrace a nomadic lifestyle, most migration is actually forced, as most communities do not accept Romani settlements. However, each year in May approximately 10,000 to 15,000 Romani people go on a pilgrimage to Les-Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer in Southern France. Roma arrive in caravans for celebrations, weddings and religious ceremonies.\n\nMany countries that were formerly part of the [[Eastern bloc]] and [[former Yugoslavia]] have substantial populations of Roma. The level of [[Racial integration|integration]] of Roma into society remains limited. In these countries, they usually remain on the margins of society, living in isolated, [[ghetto]]-like settlements (see [[Ch\u00e1nov]]). Only a small fraction of Romani children graduate from secondary schools, though numerous official efforts have been made, past and present, to compel their attendance. Roma frequently feel rejected by the state and the main population, creating another obstacle to their integration.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, 75% of Romani children are educated in schools for people with learning difficulties and 70% are unemployed, compared with a national rate of 9%. In Hungary, 44% of Romani children are in special schools, while 74% of men and 83% of women are unemployed.

The Roma find issues with documenting their own exact origin due to a lack of finding specific records left by ancestors. Their history however is retold by clan family customs, such as singing and storytelling. \nRecords cannot identify exactly why the Roma migrated from India; there are a number of possible motives, such as famine and military invasions on the part of [[Alexander the Great]] (356-323 BCE) and/or [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] (971-1030 CE).\n\n== Names ==\nThe Romani people are today found in many countries. Typically, Romani adopt given names that are common in the country of their residence. Seldom do modern Romani use traditional names from their own language, such as Papush, Luludi, Patrin, etc. It is the only Indo-Aryan language that has been spoken exclusively around Europe since the Middle Ages. Speakers use many terms for their language. They generally refer to their language as ''\u0159omani \u010dhib'' translated as \u2018the Romani language\u2019, or ''\u0159omanes'', \u2018in a Rom way\u2019.

Fingernails and toenails must be filed with an emery board; cutting them with a clipper is taboo.\n\nClothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are washed in a different place.\n\nChildbirth is considered \"impure\" and must occur outside the dwelling place; the mother is considered \"impure\" for 40 days.\n\nDeath is seen as \"impure\" and affects the whole family of the dead, who may remain \"impure\" for a period after the death; usually private items of the dead are considered to be impure and are to be buried in his/her grave or given to non-Romani poor people. \"Impure\" is not literal but rather linked to cleanliness.\n\nThis practice of burial (rather than cremation) is also found amongst the nomadic people of Western India to this day. Notable deviations from this practice exist among German Roma and British [[Romanichal]], the latter holding a tradition of cremation similar to that of some Hindu cultures. Up until the mid-20th century they invariably burned the deceased person and all their earthly belongings, including the dwelling place, all which was considered spiritually impure.

There is an element of impurity placed upon both the mother and father after the mother gives birth.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This impurity is lessened if the child is a male and the family is considered \u201clucky\u201d. Traditionally, the couple will live with the father of the groom until their first child is born.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Romani people place high value on extended family so godparents, along with this other family, are active in the child\u2019s life to ensure its well-being. The child\u2019s parents often do not have an input in what their child eats throughout the day, so the child relies on eating whatever happens to come their way.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n== Moral values ==\n\n===Romanipen===\n''Romanipen'' (also ''romanypen'', ''romanipe'', ''romanype'', ''romanimos'', ''romaimos'', ''romaniya'') is a complicated concept of [[Romani people|Romani]] philosophy encompassing totality of the Romani spirit, culture, [[Kris (Romani court)|law]], being a Rom, a set of Romani strains.\n\nAn ethnic Rom is considered to be a [[Gadjo (non-Romani)]] in Romani [[society]] if he has no Romanipen. Sometimes a Gadjo, usually an [[Adoption|adopted]] child, may be considered to be a Rom if he has Romanipen. As a concept, Romanipen has been the subject of interest to numerous academic observers. It has been hypothesized that it owes more to a [[Cultural framework|framework of culture]] than simply an adherence to historically received rules.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Saul| first1=Nicholas |first2=Susan| last2=Tebbut |title=The role of the Romanies: images and counter-images of 'Gypsies'/Romanies in European cultures|editor=Nicholas Saul, Susan Tebbutt|publisher=Liverpool University Press| year=2005| pages=218| isbn= 978-0-85323-689-4| url=https://books.google.com/?id=AQw6qOCNj-UC&pg=PA218&dq=romanipen&cd=7#v=onepage&q=romanipen&f=false| accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref>\n\nSignificant changes in Romani culture following the [[Second World War]] have been attributed to the suspension of these social norms, as strict rules relating to food and contact with certain classes of people broke down. This period also coincided with a perceived loss of authority invested in traditional leaders, the primary maintainers of Romanipen.<ref>{{cite book|last= Guy|first=Will |title=Between past and future: the Roma of Central and Eastern Europe|editor=Will Guy |publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|year=2001|pages=254|isbn= 978-1-902806-07-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lpBHAM3qafwC&pg=PA254&dq=romanipen&cd=8#v=onepage&q=romanipen&f=false|accessdate=2010-03-03}}</ref> Furthermore, the Roma who found themselves under Soviet control during the war, while deported to the east of the Urals and often persecuted, were generally left alone to follow their orthodox practices and thus preserved strict interpretations of Romanipen. However, the Roma who lived in other countries of eastern Europe, in the face of widespread discrimination and society's attempts at forced assimilation, often had to compromise their strict interpretation of the customs just in order to survive. As a result, the whole concept of Romanipen became interpreted differently among various Roma groups.\n\n=== Being a part of Romani society ===\nA considerable punishment for a Rom is expulsion from Romani society. An expelled person is considered to be \"contaminated\" and is shunned by other Romanis.\n\nTravelling Roma left symbols or signposts for their traveling fellows, known as ''patrin''s (an old word for leaf).\n\n=== Romani Code ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n[[Kris (Romani court)|Romani Code]], or ''Romano Zakono'', is the most important part of Romanipen. It is a set of rules for Romani life.\n\nThough Romani ethnic groups have different sets of rules, some rules are common for all. Those rules are considered to be the Romani Code, and rules that differ are called \"customs\". Oral Romani cultures are most likely to adhere to the Romani code, these communities are geographically spread.<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\">{{cite book|last1=Matras|first1=Yaron|title=The Romani Gypsies|date=6 January 2015|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674368385|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YfQ9BQAAQBAJ&dq=the+romani+code|accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref> There are proverbs about the Romani Code and customs, such as:\n\n* There exist as many customs as there are Romani groups. (''Kitsyk Roma, dakitsyk obychaye'' in [[Ruska Roma]]'s dialect)\n* There are many Romani groups, but only one Law. (''Romen isy but, a Zakono yekh'' in Ruska Roma's and [[Kaldarash]] dialects)\n\nRules of Romani Code describe relationships inside the Romani community and set limits for customs, behavior and other aspects of life.\n\nThe Romani Code is not written; the Romani people keep it alive in oral tradition.\n\nThe ''[[Kris (Romani court)|kris]]'' is a traditional institution for upholding and enforcing the Romani Code.\n\nThe code can be summarised in pillars; the main pillar representing the polar ideas of ''baxt'' (pronounced \"baht\") meaning honour and ''lad\u017e'' (pronounced \"Ladge\") meaning shame. Linking to the article above in reference to \"purity\" they can also represent the idea of being \"pure\" or \"clean\" and \"impure\" and \"unclean\"<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\"/> It is honourable, in Romani culture, to celebrate ''baxt'' by being generous and displaying your success to the public. The focus on generosity means sharing food is of great importance to some groups of Roma. Making lavish meals to share with other Romani visitors is commonplace and in some cases not having food to share is considered shameful.<ref name=\"The Romani Gypsies\"/>\n\n===Faith and religion===\n[[File:Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer Sarah.jpg|thumb|The cult of [[Saint Sarah]] in the shrine of [[Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer]], Southern France is a devotion associated with Catholic Romanies.]]\n\n====Hinduism====\nWhile in [[India]], the Romani people followed the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religion. This theory is supported by the Romani word for \"cross\", ''trushul'', which is the word which describes [[Shiva]]'s [[trident]] ([[Trishula|Trishul]]). A Hindu foundation means that the concept of ''kuntari'', a universal balance, is central to the people's spirituality. ''Kuntari'' means that all things belong in the universe according to their natural place. However, animals such as the flightless hen and frogs, an animal with the ability to negotiate land and water, are considered to be out of balance and are, therefore, inherently unlucky. Consequently, Roma avoid hens' eggs and frogs. Roma believe in the idea of \"pollution\", whereby the human body is vulnerable to pollution following the breaking of certain taboos\u2014pollution leads to a person becoming out of balance, like the frog and the hen.\n\nIf such taboos are broken, restoration of one's purity can only be attained through a trial overseen by a tribunal of Romani elders. This tribunal determines whether a person is guilty or innocent and, in the case of the former, the subject of the trial must complete a period of isolation for the purpose of eventual reinstatement (in particularly severe cases of pollution, permanent estrangement has occurred, but this is apparently rare in the modern era). Such pollution taboos do not apply until a Rom has undergone [[puberty]].<ref name=\"Cac\">{{cite web|title=Roma|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Norway-to-Russia/Roma.html#b |work=Countries and their Cultures|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=26 December 2012|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nMany branches of Christianity have been adopted by Roma.<ref>{{cite web|title=Restless Beings Project: Roma Engage|url=http://www.restlessbeings.org/projects/roma-gypsies|work=restlessbeings|publisher=Restless Beings |accessdate=26 December 2012|year=2008\u20132012}}</ref>\n\n====Deities and saints====\n[[Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla|Blessed Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla]] is considered a patron saint of the Romani people in Roman Catholicism.<ref>{{cite web|title=BLESSED CEFERINO GIMENEZ MALLA 1861-1936 |url=http://www.savior.org/saints/malla.htm |work=Saviour.org \u2013 Visit the Saviour|publisher=Voveo Marketing Group |accessdate=26 December 2012|date=December 2012}}</ref> [[Saint Sarah]], or Kali Sara, has been revered as a patron saint in the same manner as the Blessed Ceferino Gim\u00e9nez Malla, but a transition occurred in the 21st century, whereby Kali Sara is understood as an Indian deity brought by the refugee ancestors of the Romani people, thereby removing any Christian association.

The Roma continue to practice \"[[Shaktism]]\", a practice with origins in India, whereby a female consort is required for the worship of a god. Adherence to this practice means that for the Romani who worship a Christian God, prayer is conducted through the [[Virgin Mary]], or her mother, [[Saint Anne]]. Shaktism continues over 1,000 years after the people's separation from India.<ref name=\"Cac\" />\n\nRomani elders serve as spiritual leaders; there are no priests, churches, or bibles among the Roma, the only exception being the Pentecostal Roma.<ref name=\"Cac\" />\n\n====Balkans====\nFor the Romani communities that have resided in the Balkans for centuries, often referred to as \"Turkish Gypsies\", the following histories apply for religious beliefs:\n\n* Bulgaria: In northwestern Bulgaria and Sofia and Kyustendil, Islam has been the dominant religion; however, in the independent Bulgarian state, a major conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity has occurred.

The work they perform is seen as more legitimate, and they have begun to obtain legal permits for commercial activities.<ref name=\"Bernal\" />\n\nEvangelical Romani churches exist in every country where Roma are settled. The movement is particularly strong in France and Spain; there are more than 1,000 Romani churches (known as \"Filadelfia\" or simply ''el culto'') in Spain, with almost 100 in [[Madrid]] alone.

Many Hungarian dishes have a Romani variation such as [[cig\u00e1nypecsenye]], a dish served with [[fries]], [[bacon]] and [[salad]]. and [[goulash]]. [[Rigo Jancsi]], a Hungarian chocolate dessert is named after a Hungarian Roma. Romani people cook family recipes such as bodag (cig\u00e1nykeny\u00e9r) in Hungary. There is a Romani restaurant called [[Romani Kafenava]] in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]]. In Budapest, there is Romani restaurant called Romani Platni. In Romania, Romani people eat [[m\u0103m\u0103lig\u0103]]. There's a Romani cookbook called the Gypsy cookbook.

This belief is often cited as the etymological source of the term ''gyp'', meaning to \"cheat\", as in \"I got gypped by a [[Confidence trick|con man]].\"\n\nThere are still tensions between Roma and the majority population around them. Common complaints are that Roma [[theft|steal]] and live off [[social welfare]] and residents often reject Romani encampments.

Travellers argued in response that thousands of retrospective planning permissions are granted in Britain in cases involving non-Romani applicants each year and that statistics showed that 90% of planning applications by Roma and travellers were initially refused by local councils, compared with a national average of 20% for other applicants, potentially disproving claims of preferential treatment favouring Roma. They also argued that the root of the problem was that many traditional stopping-places had been barricaded off and that legislation passed by the previous Conservative government had effectively criminalised their communities by removing local authorities' responsibility to provide sites, thus leaving the travellers with no option but to purchase unregistered new sites themselves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series8/week_three.shtml |title=This Week's Highlights: Gypsies |date=19 September 2005 |website=[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]] |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in the United States hold regular conferences on the Roma and similar nomadic groups.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gypsies: the Usual Suspects |author=Hector Becerra |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-gypsy30jan30,0,7784207.story |newspaper=[[The Los Angeles Times]] |date=30 January 2006 |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413203211/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-gypsy30jan30,0,7784207.story |archivedate=April 13, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn Denmark, there was much controversy when the city of Helsing\u00f8r decided to put all Romani students in special classes in its public schools.

However, in some cases\u2014notably the [[Kalderash]] clan in [[Romania]], who work as traditional [[coppersmith]]s\u2014they have prospered. Although some Roma still embrace a nomadic lifestyle, most migration is actually forced, as most communities do not accept Romani settlements. However, each year in May approximately 10,000 to 15,000 Romani people go on a pilgrimage to Les-Saintes-Marie-de-la-Mer in Southern France. Roma arrive in caravans for celebrations, weddings and religious ceremonies.\n\nMany countries that were formerly part of the [[Eastern bloc]] and [[former Yugoslavia]] have substantial populations of Roma. The level of [[Racial integration|integration]] of Roma into society remains limited. In these countries, they usually remain on the margins of society, living in isolated, [[ghetto]]-like settlements (see [[Ch\u00e1nov]]). Only a small fraction of Romani children graduate from secondary schools, though numerous official efforts have been made, past and present, to compel their attendance. Roma frequently feel rejected by the state and the main population, creating another obstacle to their integration.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, 75% of Romani children are educated in schools for people with learning difficulties and 70% are unemployed, compared with a national rate of 9%. In Hungary, 44% of Romani children are in special schools, while 74% of men and 83% of women are unemployed.

As the region's largest convener of business leadership, GLI leads economic and global outreach strategies focused on business attraction; nurtures the entrepreneurial eco-system; and champions the development of the community's talent base.  As the voice of Greater Louisville's business community, GLI advocates for a pro-business environment and facilitates businesses engagement on issues that impact regional competitiveness.\n\n==History==\nIn 1862, 220 firms paid $1 each to join the Louisville Board of Trade. Prior to that, there was a Merchants Exchange that met monthly during the 1850s on the southeast corner of Second and Main. In 1913, a Convention Bureau was formed. And, in 1943, a convention Bureau was formed. By 1950, these groups and the Retail Merchants Association incorporated into the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. It was renamed Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce, and was one of the first such groups accredited by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].\n\nKenneth Vinsel was named the first chief executive officer of the chamber. The first issue of ''Louisville Magazine'' was unveiled on March 1, 1950. The offices were located on Fifth Street, between Jefferson and Liberty. In 1951, the chamber moved to the Courier-Journal and Louisville Times Building at 300 West Liberty. The chamber also played a key role in attracting General Electric to Louisville.\n\nIn 1966, Charles Herd succeeded Vinsel as The chamber's executive vice president. Herd held a similar position with the Knoxville, Tennessee, Chamber of Commerce. In 1967, the official name of the organization was changed to the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1968, the chamber's convention Bureau was split off as a separate organization.\n\nIn 1970, the Louisville Development Committee was formed. Its corollary, the Louisville Development Association, later funded a study that paved the way for the creation of the Kentucky Center for the Arts. The foundation also established offices in New York to generate national publicity for Louisville.\n\nIn 1972, Chamber efforts began to help revitalize the Kentucky Derby Festival. The minority Business Resource Center was also launched. This chamber-backed effort to assist minority-operated companies still exists today under the title of the Tri-state Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\nIn 1974, the chamber began the Bicentennial Corporation. An offshoot, Heritage Corporation, ran Heritage Weekends until 1988 from the chamber offices. In 1978, Leadership Louisville was launched at The chamber. This program, designed to broaden the horizons of local leaders, continues to grow and now operates out of separate offices. In 1979, the chamber's Visitors Bureau was split off and joined the Convention Bureau, opening an office in Founders' Square. Russel Anderson was hired as president.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the chamber started a new program for small to medium-sized businesses, which evolved into the Center for Small Business and later, the Inc. Tank. In 1983, James O. Roberson, an economic development executive, most recently from Maryland, was appointed chamber president. Also in 1983, the chamber moved to One Riverfront Plaza. In 1984, the Development Finance Center was created at the chamber to help provide venture capital for emerging businesses.\n\nIn 1986, the Government and Public Affairs division of the chamber helped Louisville businesses save millions of dollars by leading the charge to repeal the antiquated \"Unitary Tax.\" The chamber was also instrumental in phasing out the city and county inventory tax, saving businesses $4 million a year. In 1987, the chamber launched the Campaign for Greater Louisville, a $10 million quest to create new jobs in the Louisville area. Later renamed the [[Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership]], it became the major business attraction agency in the area.\n\nIn 1988, Charles H. Buddeke lll became the fourth chamber president. The chamber/partnership was named one of the nation's 10 best economic development programs by the Industrial Development Research Council. In 1990, the chamber's Kentuckiana Education & Workforce Institute published its first annual Labor Day Report, establishing a model for bridging the gap between education and the needs of employers in Louisville.\n\nDuring the 1990 State Legislative session, the chamber successfully lobbied for 12 of its 15 priorities, including the Airport Expansion and Education Reform.  The chamber, the partnership and the Office for Economic Development won an award from the American Economic Development Council for forming a successful partnership in economic development efforts.\n\nIn 1991, Mary Anne Cronan served as acting president as a nationwide search for a new chamber president was conducted.\n\nIn May 1991, at the initiative of the mayor, the county judge, the partnership and the chamber, a regional economic development strategic plan involving a broad-based, 230-person planning committee was developed. As a result of this process, the following priorities for implementation were established:  state and federal relations, Jefferson County governance, comprehensive land use and infrastructure planning, African American and minority economic development, workforce development, and coordinated economic development.\n\nRobert H. Gayle, Jr. was named president and CEO in June 1991.\n\nIn 1992, a new program was launched \u2013 the Area Councils, as a grassroots effort to make the chamber more accessible, responsive and representative to the entire community. Also during 1992, Business Advocates merged with the chamber. This group, composed of approximately 60 businesses, decided on merger because it believed that the chamber was beginning to address the needs of its members.\n\nIn 1993, the chamber moved to West Main, a five-story cornerstone building in the heart of the revitalized West Main Street district. Joining the organization in this renovated facility were the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership, the Kentuckiana Minority Supplier Development Council, the Louisville/Jefferson County Office for Economic Development and the Louisville Development Authority.  The chamber also sold ''Louisville Magazine'' in 1993. Also during 1993, the chamber began implementation of the Regional Economic Development Strategy, a four-year initiative designed to improve the competitiveness of the Louisville region.\n\nIn 1996, the chamber and the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership hired M. Ross Boyle, a nationally renowned consultant, to do a comprehensive study of the region's economic competitiveness. Boyle's conclusion:  Louisville is a \u201cnice, average town.\" Also in 1996, Bob Gayle, Chamber president, resigned to take a new position with the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce. Jim Ratcliffe served as interim president as a nationwide search for a new Chamber president was conducted.\n\nIn 1997, a 30-member community task force worked with consultant Boyle to produce an economic Visioning Report for the community. Goal:  Transform Louisville from a \u201cnice, average town\u201d into an \u201ceconomic hot spot\u201d. In August 1997, Tricon Global Restaurants, a Fortune 500 company, chose Louisville for its corporate headquarters, a project coordinated by the Economic Development Partnership.\n\nIn September 1997, as a first step in achieving the Economic Vision, the chamber merged with the Economic Development Partnership. Doug Cobb was named president and CEO of Greater Louisville Inc., the new name for the newly merged organization.  In October, GLI organized the nation's largest chamber-sponsored trade show, Showcase Greater Louisville.\n\nIn 1998, GLI signed a contract with the City of Louisville and Jefferson County to provide business expansion services \u2013 in effect merging Greater Louisville Inc. with the City/County Office for Economic Development.  Also in 1998, GLI launched The Enterprise Corporation to assist fast-growth, entrepreneurial companies, and a new Workforce initiative to retain and recruit qualified workers for the region.\n\nIn 1999, GLI, working with state and local governments, helped attract UPS Hub 2000, a billion-dollar, 6,000-job expansion that was the largest economic-development project in the nation that year.\n\nIn 2000, Steve Higdon was named president and CEO of GLI, succeeding Cobb, who returned to the private, for-profit sector.  In November, voters overwhelmingly passed a GLI-supported referendum to merge city and county government \u2013 a prime goal of the Economic Visioning Report.\n\nIn 2001, GLI and the State of Kentucky co-hosted the Inc. 500 Conference in Louisville, bringing in more than 1,000 CEOs of the nation's fastest-growing companies. In 2002, GLI moved into its new headquarters building at 614 West Main St.  GLI's agreement to become an anchor tenant sparked construction of the six-story office tower, filling in the \u201ctooth gap\u201d in the historic West Main district.\n\nIn 2003, GLI and Metro Louisville hosted the Great Midwest Capital Venture Conference, which drew more than 40 venture capital firms and more than 25 companies seeking funding.  In 2003, GLI, in partnership with the Jefferson County Public Schools and Metro Louisville, kicked-off \u201cEvery 1 Reads\u201d, an initiative designed to get every public school child reading at grade level within 4 years.\n\nIn 2004, GLI received recognition as the 2003\u20132004 American Chamber of Commerce Award of Excellence winner. In 2005, Joe Reagan is named president and CEO of GLI, succeeding Steve Higdon, who returned to the private for-profit sector. In 2005, GLI published ''Passing the Torch \u2013 Lessons Learned, Wisdom Shared'', a book profiling 54 of the community's most outstanding leaders, including conversations with them about life, leadership and service.\n\nIn 2005, GLI published ''Passing the Torch \u2013 Lessons Learned, Wisdom Shared'', a book profiling 54 of the community's most outstanding leaders, including conversations with them about life, leadership and service.

OSI and GLI enter a strategic partnership to work more closely together on behalf of the entire region.\n\n''Louisville, Then & Now,'' a book produced by GLI in partnership with Butler Books and the University of Louisville Archives, was released in November 2006.  The book was named the #1 top seller in local bookstores and the first printing sold out prior to the end of the year.\n\nIn 2007, GLI was recognized as the \u201cChamber of the Year\u201d by the American Chamber of Commerce Executives.  The competition included 105 chambers. In 2007 the 4-year-old \u201cEvery 1 Reads\u201d initiative got a big boost when the James Graham Brown Foundation announced it is giving $1 million to the city's literacy effort.\n\nTobacco product titan Philip Morris USA has given GLI a $120,000 grant in 2007 to help fund a master plan for the redevelopment of the Park Hill Corridor in West Louisville and establish a new economic development position in the University of Louisville's Signature Partnership program.\n\nIn 2008, Metro officials and GLI unveiled a program designed to raise the area's grad rate.  As part of the new \u201cGo for Graduation\u201d program, the city and GLI worked with local companies to get them to help their employees to complete degree work. In 2008 GLI, in partnership with Humana Inc., launched a wellness program for area businesses that offers incentives to motivate members and their employees for taking control of their health.\n\nLouisville received the 2008 Community Competitiveness Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for a Competitive Workforce.  The award recognizes the work done by GLI and its demonstration of leadership to construct top-notch public education and training systems.\n\nLouisville received the 2008 Community Competitiveness Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for a Competitive Workforce.

(Greater Louisville International Professionals) program to attract and retain international talent in our community.  The first of its kind in the nation, the program creates networking, professional development, mentoring, and attraction opportunities for international professionals across the region.\n\nGLI's 2009 expansion and attraction efforts helped create 2,544 new jobs, fostered more than $408 million in new capital investment and completed 56 company expansion and relocation projects.\n\nIn 2010, GLI began work on its new regional aspiration: to transform Greater Louisville into the idea capital of the world, where imaginations and individuals thrive. This long-term commitment will drive strategic thinking, investment and engagement for the entire community in the decade to come, and position Louisville to nurture the entrepreneurs poised to create the majority of tomorrow's jobs.\n\nIn 2010, GLI helped lead a coalition of business, government and civic leaders in the creation of a new initiative, called 55KDegrees, aimed at dramatically increasing the number of working-age adults with post-secondary degrees in Louisville by 55,000 by 2020.\n\nIn 2010, GLI worked with its government partners to keep Ford Motor Company in Louisville. Ford announced its plans to transform the Louisville Assembly Plant into one of the company's most flexible assembly operations in the nation, enabling Louisville to play a key role in Ford's future growth and innovation.   The announcement includes $600 million in investments at the plant and 1,800 new jobs.\n\nIn 2011, GLI CEO, Joe Reagan, was named to the board of the Bluegrass Economic Advancement Movement Board (BEAM).  BEAM is a joint effort between Louisville and Lexington to create economic development opportunities for the state, especially related to advanced manufacturing initiatives.\n\nGLI hosted Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally as its keynote speaker for its 2010 annual meeting.  Mulally was also in Louisville to highlight the $600 million investment Ford has made at its Louisville Assembly Plant.  Once the retooling is complete, Mulally said Louisville will be the company's \u201ccenter of excellence\u201d for the most technologically advanced manufacturing in the U.S.\n\nDecember 2011, Joe Reagan, president and CEO of GLI, resigned from the organization to accept a position as president and CEO of the St. Louis Regional Chamber & Growth Association.  His resignation will be effective January 26, 2012.\n\nIn January 2012 GLI's executive committee announced an executive search committee to find a successor for outgoing GLI president and CEO, Joe Reagan.

Prior to that, there was a Merchants Exchange that met monthly during the 1850s on the southeast corner of Second and Main. In 1913, a Convention Bureau was formed. And, in 1943, a convention Bureau was formed. By 1950, these groups and the Retail Merchants Association incorporated into the Louisville Chamber of Commerce. It was renamed Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce, and was one of the first such groups accredited by the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].\n\nKenneth Vinsel was named the first chief executive officer of The Chamber. The first issue of ''Louisville Magazine'' was unveiled on March 1, 1950. The offices were located on Fifth Street, between Jefferson and Liberty. In 1951, The Chamber moved to the Courier-Journal and Louisville Times Building at 300 West Liberty. The Chamber also played a key role in attracting General Electric to Louisville.\n\nIn 1966, Charles Herd succeeded Vinsel as The Chamber's executive vice president. Herd held a similar position with the Knoxville, Tennessee, Chamber of Commerce. In 1967, the official name of the organization was changed to the Louisville Area Chamber of Commerce. In 1968, the Chamber's convention Bureau was split off as a separate organization.\n\nIn 1970, the Louisville Development Committee was formed. Its corollary, the Louisville Development Association, later funded a study that paved the way for the creation of the Kentucky Center for the Arts. The foundation also established offices in New York to generate national publicity for Louisville.\n\nIn 1972, Chamber efforts began to help revitalize the Kentucky Derby Festival. The minority Business Resource Center was also launched. This Chamber-backed effort to assist minority-operated companies still exists today under the title of the Tri-state Minority Supplier Development Council.\n\nIn 1974, The Chamber began the Bicentennial Corporation. An offshoot, Heritage Corporation, ran Heritage Weekends until 1988 from the Chamber offices. In 1978, Leadership Louisville was launched at The Chamber. This program, designed to broaden the horizons of local leaders, continues to grow and now operates out of separate offices. In 1979, the Chamber's Visitors Bureau was split off and joined the Convention Bureau, opening an office in Founders' Square. Russel Anderson was hired as president.\n\nIn the early 1980s, The Chamber started a new program for small to medium-sized businesses, which evolved into the Center for Small Business and later, the Inc. Tank. In 1983, James O. Roberson, an economic development executive, most recently from Maryland, was appointed Chamber president. Also in 1983, The Chamber moved to One Riverfront Plaza. In 1984, the Development Finance Center was created at The Chamber to help provide venture capital for emerging businesses.\n\nIn 1986, the Government and Public Affairs division of The Chamber helped Louisville businesses save millions of dollars by leading the charge to repeal the antiquated \"Unitary Tax.\" The Chamber was also instrumental in phasing out the city and county inventory tax, saving businesses $4 million a year.

Gayle, Jr. was named president and CEO in June 1991.\n\nIn 1992, a new program was launched \u2013 the Area Councils, as a grassroots effort to make The Chamber more accessible, responsive and representative to the entire community. Also during 1992, Business Advocates merged with The Chamber. This group, composed of approximately 60 businesses, decided on merger because it believed that The Chamber was beginning to address the needs of its members.\n\nIn 1993, The Chamber moved to West Main, a five-story cornerstone building in the heart of the revitalized West Main Street district. Joining the organization in this renovated facility were the Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership, the Kentuckiana Minority Supplier Development Council, the Louisville/Jefferson County Office for Economic Development and the Louisville Development Authority.

The name is related to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] form [Yehoshua`] {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05bb\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7}} [[Joshua (name)|Joshua]], which is a [[theophoric name]] first mentioned within the [[Bible|Biblical tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Exodus|17:9|HE}} referring to one of [[Moses]]' companions (and his successor as leader of the Israelites).  This name is usually considered to be a compound of two parts: {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5}} ''Yeho'', a theophoric reference to [[YHWH]], the distinctive personal name of the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]], plus a form derived from the Hebrew [[triconsonantal root]] ''y-\u0161-\u0295'' or <big>\u05d9-\u05e9-\u05e2</big> \"to liberate, save\".

These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name refers to [[Joshua]] son of Nun). This historical change may have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened, including [h].<ref>Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Harvard Semitic Studies: Scholars Press 1986), p.25</ref> Usually, the traditional theophoric element [Yahu] {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5}} was shortened at the beginning of a name to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5}} [Yo-], and at the end to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4}} [-yah]. In the contraction of [Yehoshua`] to [Yeshua`], the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the ''y'' in triliteral root ''y-\u0161-\u0295''). During the post-Biblical period, the name was also adopted by Aramaic and Greek-speaking Jews.\n\n{{Jesus}}\nBy the time the [[New Testament]] was written, the [[Septuagint]] had already transliterated \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 [Yeshua`] into [[Koine Greek]] as closely as possible in the 3rd-century [[BCE]], the result being {{lang|grc| \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} [I\u0113sous]. Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' [sh], it was replaced with a \u03c3 ''sigma'' [s], and a masculine singular ending [-s] was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language.  The diphthongal [a] vowel of Masoretic [Yehoshua`] or [Yeshua`] would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' [`], which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref name=\"Philo\">Philo Judaeus, De ebrietate in Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt, ed. P. Wendland, Berlin: Reimer, 1897 (repr. De Gruyter, 1962)vol. 2:170-214, Section 96, Line 2.</ref> and [[Josephus]] frequently mention this name.  It also occurs in the Greek New Testament at Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8, referring to Joshua son of Nun.\n\nFrom Greek, {{lang|grc| \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} [I\u0113sous] moved into [[Latin]] at least by the time of the [[Vetus Latina]].

The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of ''Jesu'', accusative of ''Jesum'', and nominative of ''Jesus''. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]]: {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}} or abbreviated as: {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] \"[[Jesus (name)|Jesus]]\" {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|z|\u0259|s}} derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]].

He begins with the observation that there is no example of \"the\" son of man in Hebrew sources. He suggests that the term originates in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]\u2014''bar nash/bar nasha''. Based on his study of Aramaic sources, he concludes that in these sources: (1) \"Son of man\" is a regular expression for ''man'' in general. (2) It often serves  as an indefinite pronoun (\"one\" or \"someone\"). (3) In certain circumstances it may be employed as a [[circumlocution]]. In monologues or dialogues the speaker can refer to himself, not as 'I', but as \"the son of man\" in the third person, in contexts implying awe, reserve, or modesty. (4) In none of the extant texts does \"son of man\" figure as a title.<ref>Vermes, Geza, Jesus in his Jewish context. Minneapolis: Fortress Press. p. 82. {{ISBN|0-8006-3623-6}}.</ref>\n\n[[James E. Talmage]], a prominent writer and leader in  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] argued that the definitive article used in the New Testament makes the title \"the Son of Man\" a distinguishing appellation exclusive to Jesus. Talmage supports the view of Vermes, but adds to it the additional meaning that Jesus is the son of an exalted man, subscribing to the Church's doctrine of [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|Exaltation]]. In this sense, too, the title is unique to Jesus, as he is the only literal physical offspring of God the Father.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Son of David===\nThe title \"Son of David\" indicates Jesus' physical descent from [[David]], as well as his membership of the [[Davidic line]] of kings. The phrase is used a number of times in the [[gospel of Matthew]]. It appears in [[Matthew 1:1]] to introduce both the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and the gospel. It is found on the lips of the [[Healing the two blind men in Galilee|blind men healed in Galilee]] (\"Have mercy on us, Son of David\", {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:27|NKJV}}), the crowd who are amazed at Jesus' healing of a blind, mute and demon-possessed man {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:23|NKJV}}), the [[Exorcising the Canaanite woman's daughter|Canaanite woman whose daughter is exorcised]] (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me,\" {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:22|NKJV}}), and the [[Healing the blind near Jericho|blind men healed near Jericho]] (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us\", {{bibleverse||Matthew|20:30|NKJV}}). Finally, it also forms part of the shout of the crowds when [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Jesus enters Jerusalem]]: \"Hosanna to the Son of David\" (Matthew 21:9). Other references with the same use include {{bibleverse||Mark|10:48|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|12:35|NKJV}}.\n\nA variant of this title is found in {{bibleref||Revelation|22:16}}, where Jesus refers to himself as \"the Root and the Offspring of David\".\n\nAccording to Anglican Bishop [[Charles Ellicott]], \"Son of David\" was \"the most popular of all the names of the expected Christ\".<ref>Ellicott, C., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/1.htm Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers] on Matthew 1, accessed 10 January 2016</ref>\n\n===Lamb of God===\n{{main article|Lamb of God}}\n[[File:Agnus Dei with Vexillum.jpg|thumb|140px|A typical depiction of [[Agnus Dei]], bleeding into a [[Holy Chalice]] and carrying a Christian victory banner.]]\nThe title ''Lamb of God'' ([[Agnus Dei]]) only appears in the [[Gospel of John]], with the exclamation of [[John the Baptist]]: \"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\" in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]], the title reaffirmed the next day in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:36|John 1:36]].<ref name=Bulgakov >''The Lamb of God'' by [[Sergei Bulgakov]] 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} page 263</ref> The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as [[Rabbi]] with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.<ref>''The Life and Ministry of Jesus'' by Douglas Redford 2007 {{ISBN|0-7847-1900-4}} pages 100-101</ref>\n\nThese two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist's other proclamation in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:34|John 1:34]]: \"I have borne witness that this is the Son of God\".

This name is usually considered to be a compound of two parts: {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5}} ''Yeho'', a theophoric reference to [[YHWH]], the distinctive personal name of the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]], plus a form derived from the Hebrew [[triconsonantal root]] ''y-\u0161-\u0295'' or <big>\u05d9-\u05e9-\u05e2</big> \"to liberate, save\".

These Bible verses refer to ten individuals (in Nehemiah 8:17, the name refers to [[Joshua]] son of Nun). This historical change may have been due to a phonological shift whereby guttural phonemes weakened, including [h].<ref>Elisha Qimron, ''The Hebrew of the Dead Sea Scrolls'' (Harvard Semitic Studies: Scholars Press 1986), p.25</ref> Usually, the traditional theophoric element [Yahu] {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5}} was shortened at the beginning of a name to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d5}} [Yo-], and at the end to {{hebrew|\u05d9\u05d4}} [-yah]. In the contraction of [Yehoshua`] to [Yeshua`], the vowel is instead fronted (perhaps due to the influence of the ''y'' in triliteral root ''y-\u0161-\u0295''). During the post-Biblical period, the name was also adopted by Aramaic and Greek-speaking Jews.\n\n{{Jesus}}\nBy the time the [[New Testament]] was written, the [[Septuagint]] had already transliterated \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 [Yeshua`] into [[Koine Greek]] as closely as possible in the 3rd-century [[BCE]], the result being {{lang|grc| \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2}} [I\u0113sous]. Since Greek had no equivalent to the Semitic letter {{hebrew|\u05e9}} ''shin'' [sh], it was replaced with a \u03c3 ''sigma'' [s], and a masculine singular ending [-s] was added in the nominative case, in order to allow the name to be inflected for case (nominative, accusative, etc.) in the grammar of the Greek language.  The diphthongal [a] vowel of Masoretic [Yehoshua`] or [Yeshua`] would not have been present in Hebrew/Aramaic pronunciation during this period, and some scholars believe some dialects dropped the [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] sound of the final letter {{hebrew|\u05e2}} ''`ayin'' [`], which in any case had no counterpart in ancient Greek. The Greek writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]]<ref name=\"Philo\">Philo Judaeus, De ebrietate in Philonis Alexandrini opera quae supersunt, ed. P. Wendland, Berlin: Reimer, 1897 (repr.

The Latin name has an irregular declension, with a genitive, dative, ablative, and vocative of ''Jesu'', accusative of ''Jesum'', and nominative of ''Jesus''. [[Lower case|Minuscule]] (lower case) letters were developed around 800 and some time later the [[U]] was invented to distinguish the [[vowel]] sound from the [[consonant]]al sound and the [[J]] to distinguish the consonant from [[I]]. Similarly, Greek minuscules were invented about the same time, prior to that the name was written in [[capital letters]]: {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9\u039f\u03a5\u03f9}} or abbreviated as: {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} with a line over the top, see also [[Christogram]].\n\n[[Modern English]] \"[[Jesus (name)|Jesus]]\" {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|z|\u0259|s}} derives from Early Middle English ''Iesu'' (attested from the 12th century). The name participated in the [[Great Vowel Shift]] in late [[Middle English]] (15th century). The letter [[J]] was first distinguished from 'I' by the Frenchman [[Petrus Ramus|Pierre Ramus]] in the 16th century, but did not become common in Modern English until the 17th century, so that early 17th century works such as the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]] (1611) continued to print the name with an I.<ref>[http://nazirene.peopleofhonoronly.com/images/kjv1611/Jesus_Iesus.jpg Image] of the first edition of the [[King James Version of the Bible]], [[Gospel of Luke]].

He begins with the observation that there is no example of \"the\" son of man in Hebrew sources. He suggests that the term originates in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]\u2014''bar nash/bar nasha''. Based on his study of Aramaic sources, he concludes that in these sources: (1) \"Son of man\" is a regular expression for ''man'' in general. (2) It often serves  as an indefinite pronoun (\"one\" or \"someone\"). (3) In certain circumstances it may be employed as a [[circumlocution]]. In monologues or dialogues the speaker can refer to himself, not as 'I', but as \"the son of man\" in the third person, in contexts implying awe, reserve, or modesty. (4) In none of the extant texts does \"son of man\" figure as a title.<ref>Vermes, Geza, Jesus in his Jewish context. Minneapolis: Fortress Press. p. 82. {{ISBN|0-8006-3623-6}}.</ref>\n\n[[James E. Talmage]], a prominent writer and leader in  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] argued that the definitive article used in the New Testament makes the title \"the Son of Man\" a distinguishing appellation exclusive to Jesus. Talmage supports the view of Vermes, but adds to it the additional meaning that Jesus is the son of an exalted man, subscribing to the Church's doctrine of [[Exaltation (Mormonism)|Exaltation]]. In this sense, too, the title is unique to Jesus, as he is the only literal physical offspring of God the Father.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Son of David===\nThe title \"Son of David\" indicates Jesus' physical descent from [[David]], as well as his membership of the [[Davidic line]] of kings. The phrase is used a number of times in the [[gospel of Matthew]]. It appears in [[Matthew 1:1]] to introduce both the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and the gospel. It is found on the lips of the [[Healing the two blind men in Galilee|blind men healed in Galilee]] (\"Have mercy on us, Son of David\", {{bibleverse||Matthew|9:27|NKJV}}), the crowd who are amazed at Jesus' healing of a blind, mute and demon-possessed man {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:23|NKJV}}), the [[Exorcising the Canaanite woman's daughter|Canaanite woman whose daughter is exorcised]] (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me,\" {{bibleverse||Matthew|15:22|NKJV}}), and the [[Healing the blind near Jericho|blind men healed near Jericho]] (\"Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us\", {{bibleverse||Matthew|20:30|NKJV}}). Finally, it also forms part of the shout of the crowds when [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Jesus enters Jerusalem]]: \"Hosanna to the Son of David\" (Matthew 21:9). Other references with the same use include {{bibleverse||Mark|10:48|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|12:35|NKJV}}.\n\nA variant of this title is found in {{bibleref||Revelation|22:16}}, where Jesus refers to himself as \"the Root and the Offspring of David\".\n\nAccording to Anglican Bishop [[Charles Ellicott]], \"Son of David\" was \"the most popular of all the names of the expected Christ\".<ref>Ellicott, C., [http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/1.htm Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers] on Matthew 1, accessed 10 January 2016</ref>\n\n===Lamb of God===\n{{main article|Lamb of God}}\n[[File:Agnus Dei with Vexillum.jpg|thumb|140px|A typical depiction of [[Agnus Dei]], bleeding into a [[Holy Chalice]] and carrying a Christian victory banner.]]\nThe title ''Lamb of God'' ([[Agnus Dei]]) only appears in the [[Gospel of John]], with the exclamation of [[John the Baptist]]: \"Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world\" in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:29|John 1:29]], the title reaffirmed the next day in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:36|John 1:36]].<ref name=Bulgakov >''The Lamb of God'' by [[Sergei Bulgakov]] 2008 {{ISBN|0-8028-2779-9}} page 263</ref> The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as [[Rabbi]] with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.<ref>''The Life and Ministry of Jesus'' by Douglas Redford 2007 {{ISBN|0-7847-1900-4}} pages 100-101</ref>\n\nThese two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist's other proclamation in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:34|John 1:34]]: \"I have borne witness that this is the Son of God\".

He was the creator of the series ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' and ''[[Buster Brown]]'', and is considered a key pioneer of the modern [[comic strip]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\nRichard Felton Outcault was born on January 14, 1863, in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], to Catherine Davis and Jesse P. {{not a typo|Outcalt}}\u2014spelled without the ''u'' their son later added.  He attended [[Art Academy of Cincinnati|McMicken University's school of design]] in Cincinnati from 1878 to 1881, and after graduating did commercial painting{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} for the Hall Safe and Lock Company.{{sfn|Dunley|2014|p=278}}\n\n===Early career===\n\nOutcault painted electric light displays for [[Edison Laboratories]] for the 1888 Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States in Cincinnati.  This led to full-time work with Edison in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], doing mechanical drawings and illustrations.  Edison appointed him official artist for the company's traveling exhibition in 1889\u201390, which included supervising the installation of Edison exhibits at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris.  While there he studied art in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] and added the ''u'' to his surname.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nIn 1890 Outcault returned to the US, married, and moved to [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in New York City.  He worked making technical drawings to ''Street Railway Journal'' and ''Electrical World'',{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} a magazine owned by one of Edison's friends.<ref name=virtue>[http://www.virtuemag.org/articles/the-yellow-kid Wallace, Derek.

The ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]'' added a [[Supplement (publishing)|color supplement]] in 1892, the first in the US, and when the ''World''{{'}}s publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] saw it, he ordered for his own newspaper the same{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} four-color [[rotary printing press]].{{sfn|Dunley|2014|p=279}}  A color Sunday humor supplement began to run in the ''World'' in Spring 1893.  The supplement's editor [[Morrill Goddard]] contacted Outcault via [[Roy McCardell]] on the staff of ''Puck'' and offered Outcault a full-time position with the ''World''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nOutcault's first cartoon for the paper appeared on September 16, 1894: a six-panel, full-page comic strip titled \"Uncle Eben's Ignorance of the City\".  Though not the first strips to employ multi-panel narrative strips\u2014even at the ''World''\u2014Outcault's were among the earliest.  His primary subjects were African Americans who lived in a town called Possumville and Irish immigrants who lived in [[tenement]] slums.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nAn Outcault cartoon from the June 2, 1894, issue of ''Judge'' featured a big-eared, bald street kid in a gown.  Outcault continued to draw the character, who made his debut in the ''World'' on January 13, 1895.  The kid appeared in color for the first time in the May 5 issue in a cartoon titled \"At the Circus in Hogan's Alley\".  Outcault weekly ''Hogan's Alley'' cartoons appeared from then on in color, starring rambunctious slum kids in the streets, in particular the bald kid, who gained the name Mickey Dugan.  In the January 5 episode of ''Hogan's Alley'', Mickey's gown appeared in bright yellow.  He soon became the star of the strip and became known as ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'', and that May the Kid's dialogue began appearing on his yellow gown.  The strip's popularity drove up the ''World''{{'}}s circulation and the Kid was widely merchandised.  Its level of success drove other papers to publish such strips, and thus the Yellow Kid is seen as a landmark in the development of the comic strip as a mass medium.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nOutcault may not have benefited from the strip's merchandise revenue.  Though he applied at least three times, he does not appear to have been granted a copyright on the strip.  Common practice at the time would have given the publisher the copyrights to the strips they printed on a work-for-hire basis, though not to the characters therein.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nCalifornia newspaperman [[William Randolph Hearst]] set up offices in New York after buying the failing ''New York Morning Journal'', which he renamed the ''[[New York Journal]]''.  He bought a color press and hired away the ''World''{{'}}s Sunday supplement staff, including Outcault, at greatly increased salaries.  Hearst's color humor supplement was named ''The American Humorist'' and advertised as \"eight pages of polychromatic effulgence that make the rainbow look like a lead pipe\".  It debuted on October 18, 1896, and an advertisement in the ''Journal'' the day before boasted: \"The Yellow Kid\u2014Tomorrow, Tomorrow!\"  The strip was titled ''McFadden's Row of Flats'', as the ''World'' claimed the ''Hogan's Alley'' title.  A week earlier, on October 11, Outcault's replacement at the ''World'' [[George Luks]] took over with his own version of ''Hogan's Alley'';{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} he had handled the strip earlier, the first time that May 31.{{sfn|Barker|1995|p=27}}  Both papers advertised themselves with posters featuring the Yellow Kid, and soon the association with their sensational style of journalism led to the coining of the term \"[[yellow journalism]]\".{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nThe installment for October 25, 1896\u2014\"The Yellow Kid and his New Phonograph\"\u2014featured [[speech balloon]]s for the first time.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=9\u201310}}  Outcault's strips appeared twice a week in the ''Journal'', and took on a form that was to become standard: multipanel strips in which the images and text were inextricably bound to each other.  Comics historian [[Bill Blackbeard]] asserted this made it \"nothing less than the first definitive comic strip in history\".  From January to May 1897, Hearst sent Outcault and the ''Humorist''{{'}}s editor [[Rudolph Block]] to Europe, a trip Outcault reported on in the paper through a mock Yellow Kid diary and an ''Around the World with the Yellow Kid'' strip, which took the place of ''McFadden's Row of Flats''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nThe Yellow Kid's popularity soon faded, and the last strip appeared on January 23, 1898.  Luks' version had ended the month before.  The character made rare appearances thereafter.  Hearst had launched the ''[[New York Evening Journal]]'' and made Outcault the editor of the daily comics page.  He continued to contribute cartoons to it, as well as to the ''World'', where he had ''Casey\u2019s Corner'' published, a strip about African-American characters that debuted on February 13, 1898, and moved to the ''Evening Journal'' on April 8, 1898.

He was the creator of the series ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' and ''[[Buster Brown]]'', and is considered a key pioneer of the modern [[comic strip]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\nRichard Felton Outcault was born on January 14, 1863, in [[Lancaster, Ohio]], to Catherine Davis and Jesse P. {{not a typo|Outcalt}}\u2014spelled without the ''u'' their son later added.  He attended [[Art Academy of Cincinnati|McMicken University's school of design]] in Cincinnati from 1878 to 1881, and after graduating did commercial painting{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} for the Hall Safe and Lock Company.{{sfn|Dunley|2014|p=278}}\n\n===Early career===\n\nOutcault painted electric light displays for [[Edison Laboratories]] for the 1888 Centennial Exposition of the Ohio Valley and Middle Atlantic States in Cincinnati.  This led to full-time work with Edison in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], doing mechanical drawings and illustrations.  Edison appointed him official artist for the company's traveling exhibition in 1889\u201390, which included supervising the installation of Edison exhibits at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris.  While there he studied art in the [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]] and added the ''u'' to his surname.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nIn 1890 Outcault returned to the US, married, and moved to [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] in New York City.  He worked making technical drawings to ''Street Railway Journal'' and ''Electrical World'',{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} a magazine owned by one of Edison's friends.<ref name=virtue>[http://www.virtuemag.org/articles/the-yellow-kid Wallace, Derek.

The ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]'' added a [[Supplement (publishing)|color supplement]] in 1892, the first in the US, and when the ''World''{{'}}s publisher [[Joseph Pulitzer]] saw it, he ordered for his own newspaper the same{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} four-color [[rotary printing press]].{{sfn|Dunley|2014|p=279}}  A color Sunday humor supplement began to run in the ''World'' in Spring 1893.  The supplement's editor [[Morrill Goddard]] contacted Outcault via [[Roy McCardell]] on the staff of ''Puck'' and offered Outcault a full-time position with the ''World''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nOutcault's first cartoon for the paper appeared on September 16, 1894: a six-panel, full-page comic strip titled \"Uncle Eben's Ignorance of the City\".  Though not the first strips to employ multi-panel narrative strips\u2014even at the ''World''\u2014Outcault's were among the earliest.  His primary subjects were African Americans who lived in a town called Possumville and Irish immigrants who lived in [[tenement]] slums.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nAn Outcault cartoon from the June 2, 1894, issue of ''Judge'' featured a big-eared, bald street kid in a gown.  Outcault continued to draw the character, who made his debut in the ''World'' on January 13, 1895.  The kid appeared in color for the first time in the May 5 issue in a cartoon titled \"At the Circus in Hogan's Alley\".  Outcault weekly ''Hogan's Alley'' cartoons appeared from then on in color, starring rambunctious slum kids in the streets, in particular the bald kid, who gained the name Mickey Dugan.  In the January 5 episode of ''Hogan's Alley'', Mickey's gown appeared in bright yellow.  He soon became the star of the strip and became known as ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'', and that May the Kid's dialogue began appearing on his yellow gown.  The strip's popularity drove up the ''World''{{'}}s circulation and the Kid was widely merchandised.  Its level of success drove other papers to publish such strips, and thus the Yellow Kid is seen as a landmark in the development of the comic strip as a mass medium.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nOutcault may not have benefited from the strip's merchandise revenue.  Though he applied at least three times, but does not appear to have been granted a copyright on the strip.  Common practice at the time would have given the publisher the copyrights to the strips they printed on a work-for-hire basis, though not to the characters therein.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nCalifornia newspaperman [[William Randolph Hearst]] set up offices in New York after buying the failing ''New York Morning Journal'', which he renamed the ''[[New York Journal]]''.  He bought a color press and hired away the ''World''{{'}}s Sunday supplement staff, including Outcault, at greatly increased salaries.  Hearst's color humor supplement was named ''The American Humorist'' and advertised as \"eight pages of polychromatic effulgence that make the rainbow look like a lead pipe\".  It debuted on October 18, 1896, and an advertisement in the ''Journal'' the day before boasted: \"The Yellow Kid\u2014Tomorrow, Tomorrow!\"  The strip was titled ''McFadden's Row of Flats'', as the ''World'' claimed the ''Hogan's Alley'' title.  A week earlier, on October 11, Outcault's replacement at the ''World'' [[George Luks]] took over with his own version of ''Hogan's Alley'';{{sfn|Harvey|2016}} he had handled the strip earlier, the first time that May 31.{{sfn|Barker|1995|p=27}}  Both papers advertised themselves with posters featuring the Yellow Kid, and soon the association with their sensational style of journalism led to the coining of the term \"[[yellow journalism]]\".{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nThe installment for October 25, 1896\u2014\"The Yellow Kid and his New Phonograph\"\u2014featured [[speech balloon]]s for the first time.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=9\u201310}}  Outcault's strips appeared twice a week in the ''Journal'', and took on a form that was to become standard: multipanel strips in which the images and text were inextricably bound to each other.  Comics historian [[Bill Blackbeard]] asserted this made it \"nothing less than the first definitive comic strip in history\".  From January to May 1897, Hearst sent Outcault and the ''Humorist''{{'}}s editor [[Rudolph Block]] to Europe, a trip Outcault reported on in the paper through a mock Yellow Kid diary and an ''Around the World with the Yellow Kid'' strip, which took the place of ''McFadden's Row of Flat's''.{{sfn|Harvey|2016}}\n\nThe Yellow Kid's popularity soon faded, and the last strip appeared on January 23, 1898.

It is the fifth title in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], and the first main entry since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/>\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\"/> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\"/> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\"/> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\"/> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/><ref name=\"IGN Hood\"/> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\"/>\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, while robbing a bank in Liberty City, criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is shot and betrayed by his girlfriend and accomplice Catalina (Cynthia Farrell), who escapes with their getaway driver, a Colombian gangster named Miguel (Al Espinosa).<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> Claude survives but is arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison. Claude and fellow prisoner 8-Ball ([[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]) escape from a prison transport when the Colombian Cartel attack the police convoy to retrieve a third prisoner.<ref name=\"Give Me Liberty\"/> 8-Ball later introduces Claude to the Leone [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]] Crime Family: ''Sex Club 7'' owner Luigi Goterelli ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone ([[Frank Vincent]]), his son Joey Leone ([[Michael Rapaport]]), and Capo [[Toni Cipriani]] ([[Michael Madsen]]).<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> During work for the family, Claude finds himself fighting the Colombians,<ref name=\"Bomb Da Base\"/> led by Catalina and Miguel, who are distributing a new street drug called SPANK.<ref name=\"Cutting the Grass\"/> After destroying the Colombians' ship, Salvatore attempts to have Claude killed with a booby-trapped car, but Salvatore's [[trophy wife]] Maria ([[Debi Mazar]]), who has taken a liking to Claude after he served as her chaffeur, saves him just in time. She admits that, during a fight with Salvatore, she told her husband that she was having an affair with Claude. Together with her friend Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai), they flee Portland for Staunton Island.<ref name=\"Last Requests\"/>\n\nClaude begins working for the city's [[Yakuza]] under Asuka, who has Claude assassinate Salvatore. This cuts off all of Claude's ties with the Leone family, who are now against him.<ref name=\"Sayonara Salvatore\"/> Claude's work leads him to allying himself with other criminal sources, such as corrupt police detective Ray Machowski ([[Robert Loggia]]), an enemy of the Cartel.<ref name=\"Arms Shortage\"/> Claude later saves him from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] and the [[CIA]] by helping him flee to Vice City.<ref name=\"Marked Man\"/> Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who maintains a huge media front.<ref name=\"Liberator\"/> In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel to lower real estate prices, Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka's brother Kenji Kasen (Les Mau) and blame the Cartel.<ref name=\"Waka-Gashira Wipeout\"/> While on an errand, Claude finally confronts Catalina, who narrowly escapes. Asuka abducts Miguel, believing him to have knowledge of her brother's death.<ref name=\"Grand Theft Aero\"/>\n\nWith the war with the Cartel intensifying, Asuka and Maria learn of Claude's history with Catalina and order him to attack many Cartel operations that Miguel reveals after being tortured by Asuka.<ref name=\"Bait\"/><ref name=\"Espresso-2-Go!\"/><ref name=\"S.A.M.\"/> Eventually, his exploits attract the attention of Catalina. As a result, the Cartel kidnap Maria, murder Asuka and Miguel, and demand Claude to pay a $500,000 ransom in exchange for Maria's release.<ref name=\"Ransom\"/> When Claude confronts Catalina, she attempts to have him killed, but he escapes. In the resulting firefight, Catalina attempts to flee in a helicopter and makes a final attempt on Claude's life. After killing the remaining Cartel members and rescuing Maria, Claude shoots down the helicopter, effectively killing Catalina.<ref name=\"The Exchange\"/> As they are leaving the scene, Maria complains to Claude about the kidnapping, particularly the state of her appearance. During the credits, a gunshot is heard, and Maria's voice is silenced.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her. Rockstar has refused to confirm this.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe core development team of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' consisted of about 23 people at [[DMA Design]] in [[Edinburgh]], who worked closely with publisher [[Rockstar Games]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars, and some weapons.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> An [[online multiplayer]] mode was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Producer [[Leslie Benzies]] described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as a \"crime simulation game\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on 22 October 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> When porting the game to [[Microsoft Windows]], the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games.<ref name=\"PC Interview\"/>\n\n=== Open world design ===\n[[File:Gta3-pc-stealing.jpeg|right|thumb|''Grand Theft Auto III'' is the first game in the series to use a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] view model, positioning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] closer to the player character.]]\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to be the first 3D game in the series,{{sfn|Kushner|2012|pp=81\u201382}} using [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"PC Graphics\"/> When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/> Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> Executive producer [[Sam Houser]] felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".<ref name=\"1UP Sam\"/>\n\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world;<ref name=\"IGN Dan\"/> producer [[Dan Houser]] said that there was about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Dan\"/> while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000.<ref name=\"Sound Usher\"/> The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] model.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/> Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/>\n\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which producer [[Dan Houser]] describes as \"a post industrial [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] slash [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] generic\" city.<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), basing it loosely on [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], a commercial centre resembling [[Manhattan]], and suburbs similar to [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=83}} The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], New York, and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Sam Houser cited films and shows like ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} He also cited the influence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), describing ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\"/><ref name=\"Americana\">{{cite interview | title=Americana at Its Most Felonious: Q. and A.: Rockstar\u2019s Dan Houser on Grand Theft Auto V | interviewer=Chris Suellentrop | first=Dan | last=Houser | subjectlink=Dan Houser | date=9 November 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html | archivedate=10 November 2012 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Story and characters ===\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. \"We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story,\" said Dan Houser.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> Houser found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/>\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\"/> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\"/> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\"/> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\"/> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\"/> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\"/>\n\n=== Cuts, changes, and the 9/11 effect ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]]. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\"/>\n\nAnother cut to the game is the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that the character was related to 9/11, however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\"/> There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release,<ref name=\"GameSpot Impressions\"/> although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/>\n\nRockstar stated that the game was \"about 1% different\" after 9/11, and that the biggest change was the cover art. They felt that the original cover, which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe, felt \"too raw\" after 9/11, and was changed into what became the \"signature style\" of the series.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> Sam Houser claims that the cover was designed in an evening, and was instantly preferred over the original cover.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/> The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n=== Initial release ===\n{{Video game reviews\n| title   = PlayStation 2 version reception\n| MC      = 97/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| 1UP     = A+<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n| Edge    = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG   = 10/10<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n| GamePro = 5/5<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GI      = 9.5/10<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/>\n| GSpot   = 9.6/10<ref name=\"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy    = 94/100<ref name=\"GameSpy Review\"/>\n| IGN     = 9.6/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released to critical acclaim.

This was met with widespread controversy.<ref name=\"Telegraph Memorable\"/> The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\"/> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\"/> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\"/> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\"/> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) [[List of banned video games in Australia|banned it]], due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus Ban\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\"/> This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\"/> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\"/>\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede.

[[action-adventure game]] developed by [[DMA Design]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It is the fifth title in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]], and the first main entry since 1999's ''[[Grand Theft Auto 2]]''. Set within the fictional Liberty City, based on [[New York City]], the game follows a criminal named [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] after he is left for dead and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime and corruption. The game is played from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. The [[open world]] design lets players freely roam the three islands of Liberty City.\n\nDevelopment was shared between DMA Design, based in [[Edinburgh]], and Rockstar, based in [[New York City]]. Much of the development work involved transforming popular elements from the ''Grand Theft Auto'' series into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the [[September 11 attacks]] to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. It was released in October 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]], in May 2002 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and in October 2003 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]].\n\nUpon release, ''Grand Theft Auto III'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its concept and gameplay. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at its depictions of violence and sex. It became the [[best-selling video game]] of 2001, and has sold over 14.5 million copies since. Considered by many critics as one of the most significant titles of the [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation of video games]], and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]], it won a number of year-end accolades, including [[Game of the Year]] awards from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. Since its release, it has received [[Porting|ports]] to many different gaming platforms. An enhanced version of the game was released on [[mobile platforms]] in 2011, for the game's tenth anniversary. Its successor, ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', was released in October 2002.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Gta3-pc-walking.jpeg|left|thumb|Players can freely roam the game's world and have the ability to use weapons to accomplish tasks.]]\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is an [[action-adventure game]] played from a [[third-person perspective]]. Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/> Outside of missions, players can [[Nonlinear gameplay|freely roam]] the game's [[open world]], and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the story progresses.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/>\n\nPlayers may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game's world.<ref name=\"IGN Cars\"/> In combat, [[auto-aim]] can be used as assistance against enemies.<ref name=\"GameSpot Hands-On\"/> Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. [[Personal armor|Body armour]] can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}} When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players [[Spawning (video game)|respawn]] at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour and an amount of money.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n\nIf players commit crimes while playing, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"[[Fugitive|wanted]]\" meter in the [[HUD (video gaming)|head-up display]] (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/> (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive).{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=11}} Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a [[cooldown]] mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n\nThe game lets players control the [[Muteness|mute]] criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]].<ref name=\"Q-A\"/> During the story, Claude meets various new characters from gangs. As players complete missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight.<ref name=\"IGN Gangs\"/> While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a [[vigilante]] minigame, a [[fire fighting]] activity, a paramedic service and a [[taxi cab]] service.<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/><ref name=\"IGN Hood\"/> Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to [[bribe]] police after committing a crime.<ref name=\"1UP Essential\"/>\n\n[[File:GTAIII PS2 Beta Drive-by.jpg|thumb|right|Combat in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' was reworked to allow players to perform [[drive-by shooting]]s by viewing sideways in a car.]]\n\nPlayers use [[Melee#Use in gaming|melee]] attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the [[Micro Uzi]], an [[M16 rifle]] and a [[flamethrower]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The game's three-dimension environment allows a [[first-person view]] while aiming with the [[sniper rifle]], [[rocket launcher]] and the [[M16 rifle]]. In addition, the game's combat was reworked to allow players to commit [[drive-by shooting]]s by facing sideways in a vehicle.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options\u2014they can be purchased from local [[firearms dealer]]s, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.{{sfn|DMA Design|2001|p=12}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2001, while robbing a bank in Liberty City, criminal [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] is shot and betrayed by his girlfriend and accomplice Catalina (Cynthia Farrell), who escapes with their getaway driver, a Colombian gangster named Miguel (Al Espinosa).<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> Claude survives but is arrested and sentenced to ten years in prison. Claude and fellow prisoner 8-Ball ([[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]) escape from a prison transport when the Colombian Cartel attack the police convoy to retrieve a third prisoner.<ref name=\"Give Me Liberty\"/> 8-Ball later introduces Claude to the Leone [[Italian Mafia|Mafia]] Crime Family: ''Sex Club 7'' owner Luigi Goterelli ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), [[Crime boss|Don]] Salvatore Leone ([[Frank Vincent]]), his son Joey Leone ([[Michael Rapaport]]), and Capo [[Toni Cipriani]] ([[Michael Madsen]]).<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> During work for the family, Claude finds himself fighting the Colombians,<ref name=\"Bomb Da Base\"/> led by Catalina and Miguel, who are distributing a new street drug called SPANK.<ref name=\"Cutting the Grass\"/> After destroying the Colombians' ship, Salvatore attempts to have Claude killed with a booby-trapped car, but Salvatore's [[trophy wife]] Maria ([[Debi Mazar]]), who has taken a liking to Claude after he served as her chaffeur, saves him just in time. She admits that, during a fight with Salvatore, she told her husband that she was having an affair with Claude. Together with her friend Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai), they flee Portland for Staunton Island.<ref name=\"Last Requests\"/>\n\nClaude begins working for the city's [[Yakuza]] under Asuka, who has Claude assassinate Salvatore. This cuts off all of Claude's ties with the Leone family, who are now against him.<ref name=\"Sayonara Salvatore\"/> Claude's work leads him to allying himself with other criminal sources, such as corrupt police detective Ray Machowski ([[Robert Loggia]]), an enemy of the Cartel.<ref name=\"Arms Shortage\"/> Claude later saves him from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] and the [[CIA]] by helping him flee to Vice City.<ref name=\"Marked Man\"/> Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), who maintains a huge media front.<ref name=\"Liberator\"/> In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel to lower real estate prices, Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka's brother Kenji Kasen (Les Mau) and blame the Cartel.<ref name=\"Waka-Gashira Wipeout\"/> While on an errand, Claude finally confronts Catalina, who narrowly escapes. Asuka abducts Miguel, believing him to have knowledge of her brother's death.<ref name=\"Grand Theft Aero\"/>\n\nWith the war with the Cartel intensifying, Asuka and Maria learn of Claude's history with Catalina and order him to attack many Cartel operations that Miguel reveals after being tortured by Asuka.<ref name=\"Bait\"/><ref name=\"Espresso-2-Go!\"/><ref name=\"S.A.M.\"/> Eventually, his exploits attract the attention of Catalina. As a result, the Cartel kidnap Maria, murder Asuka and Miguel, and demand Claude to pay a $500,000 ransom in exchange for Maria's release.<ref name=\"Ransom\"/> When Claude confronts Catalina, she attempts to have him killed, but he escapes. In the resulting firefight, Catalina attempts to flee in a helicopter and makes a final attempt on Claude's life. After killing the remaining Cartel members and rescuing Maria, Claude shoots down the helicopter, effectively killing Catalina.<ref name=\"The Exchange\"/> As they are leaving the scene, Maria complains to Claude about the kidnapping, particularly the state of her appearance. During the credits, a gunshot is heard, and Maria's voice is silenced.{{efn|The sound of a gunshot, and the silencing of Maria's voice, has led to speculation that Claude fired the shot to kill Maria or just to silence her. Rockstar has refused to confirm this.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>}}\n\n== Development ==\nThe core development team of ''Grand Theft Auto III'' consisted of about 23 people at [[DMA Design]] in [[Edinburgh]], who worked closely with publisher [[Rockstar Games]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars, and some weapons.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> An [[online multiplayer]] mode was initially planned for the game, but was ultimately dropped due to time and resource limitations.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Producer [[Leslie Benzies]] described ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as a \"crime simulation game\".<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The game was released for the [[PlayStation 2]] on 22 October 2001 in North America.<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> When porting the game to [[Microsoft Windows]], the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous ''Grand Theft Auto'' games.<ref name=\"PC Interview\"/>\n\n=== Open world design ===\n[[File:Gta3-pc-stealing.jpeg|right|thumb|''Grand Theft Auto III'' is the first game in the series to use a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] view model, positioning the [[Virtual camera system|camera]] closer to the player character.]]\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' is considered to be the first 3D game in the series,{{sfn|Kushner|2012|pp=81\u201382}} using [[Criterion Games]]' [[RenderWare]] [[game engine]].<ref name=\"PC Graphics\"/> When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' games. Benzies stated that the intention was to recreate the \"freedom and diversity\" of the previous games in a \"living, breathing 3D world\", using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> The console's ability to use [[DVD]]s, an improvement over the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]'s limit to [[CD]]s, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=81}} Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2's 32 megabytes of [[RAM]], due to the scale. The game's size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/> Benzies felt that creating a living city was the \"underlying principle\" of the game's concept during development.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies\"/> Executive producer [[Sam Houser]] felt that the game's 3D element allowed the \"chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time\".<ref name=\"1UP Sam\"/>\n\nA major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world;<ref name=\"IGN Dan\"/> producer [[Dan Houser]] said that there was about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Dan\"/> while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000.<ref name=\"Sound Usher\"/> The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable [[Stream (computing)|streaming]] model.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/> Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.<ref name=\"IGN Benzies DMA\"/>\n\nWhen designing the game world, the team initially created a \"hybrid city\", which producer [[Dan Houser]] describes as \"a post industrial [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] slash [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] generic\" city.<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> Upon developing within this game world, the team realised that basing the design on a real location meant \"you have a lot of things you can say about it\".<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> As a result, the team redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' (1997), basing it loosely on [[New York City]].<ref name=\"IGN Dan 2\"/> The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]], a commercial centre resembling [[Manhattan]], and suburbs similar to [[New Jersey]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=83}} The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to \"start out feeling poor and work to being richer\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> Dan Houser describes Liberty City as a \"hybrid of a generic American city\", including [[Chicago]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Detroit]], New York, and [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> He felt that the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously.{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} Sam Houser cited films and shows like ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (1999\u20132007) as inspiration for the setting, and wanted to emulate them in the game.{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} He also cited the influence of ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and the film ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), describing ''Grand Theft Auto III'' as \"a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\"/><ref name=\"Americana\">{{cite interview | title=Americana at Its Most Felonious: Q. and A.: Rockstar\u2019s Dan Houser on Grand Theft Auto V | interviewer=Chris Suellentrop | first=Dan | last=Houser | subjectlink=Dan Houser | date=9 November 2012 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=30 July 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110091527/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/10/arts/video-games/q-and-a-rockstars-dan-houser-on-grand-theft-auto-v.html | archivedate=10 November 2012 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Story and characters ===\nThe team developed the story and design simultaneously. \"We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story,\" said Dan Houser.<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> Houser found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic \"rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy\".<ref name=\"EW Dan\"/> The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/> Houser felt that each mission is \"its own short story\", and part of an \"overarching story\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Dan\"/> Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by [[Martin Scorsese]]. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with [[post-it note]]s to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.<ref name=\"IGN How2\"/>\n\nMany of the game characters were animated using [[motion capture]], filmed at a rented studio at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]],{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=82}} though this was limited by technical restraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] heavily inhibited this.<ref name=\"IGN How3\"/> Animating [[non-player character]]s entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. \"It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code,\" recalled software engineer [[Alan Campbell (writer)|Alan Campbell]].{{sfn|Crookes|2013|pp=58\u201363}} The team used varying camera angles when animating the game's cutscenes, in order to evoke different emotions.<ref name=\"IGN Cinematic\"/> For the voice acting, the team wanted \"natural, subtle performances\", which proved difficult as many of the actors \"had in their head the idea that because video games are animated their performances needed to be animated\", explained motion capture director [[Navid Khonsari]].<ref name=\"IGN How3\"/> The game's playable protagonist is unnamed in the game,<ref name=\"IGN Characters\"/> and his name is not officially revealed as [[Claude (Grand Theft Auto)|Claude]] until his appearance in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' (2004). He is a [[silent protagonist]], never speaking throughout his appearances. The team decided to make Claude silent primarily because it \"did not seem like a major issue\", due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as the character will be who the players want him to be.<ref name=\"Q-A\"/>\n\n=== Sound design ===\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity, to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the [[Mob film|gangster movie]] culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city, and provide a \"unique take on American life\";<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\"/> Sam Houser described it as \"a very iconoclastic look at America\".<ref name=\"IGN Sam\"/> The team used real [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s to portray those on the radio. In doing so, the team wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of \"high production values and absurd content\". Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station\u2014music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, station imaging.<ref name=\"IGN Sounds3\"/>\n\n=== Cuts, changes, and the 9/11 effect ===\n{{Multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal|total_width=500|image1=GTAIII LCPD copcar change.jpg|caption1=After the events of [[9/11]], the original colour scheme of the police cars in the game (top), which resembled the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], was changed to a generic black-and-white design common in the United States.|image2=GTA3 UK Cover.jpg|caption2=The original artwork for the game, which was changed after the events of 9/11.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> This artwork was still used as the cover in Europe.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/>}}\n\n{{Quote|quote=[W]e felt that a full content review of all our titles and the marketing materials we use to represent them was absolutely necessary for us ... we have come across certain small contextual references that we were no longer comfortable with, as well as a couple of very rare gameplay instances that no longer felt appropriate to us.|author=Terry Donovan, Rockstar managing director|source=IGN, 19 September 2001<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/>}}\n\nPrior to the initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during [[game development]], the changes in ''Grand Theft Auto III'' were noted to be around the time of the [[September 11 attacks]], which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay.<ref name=\"911 Delay\"/> \"Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]\", said [[Paul Eibeler]], then-president of distributor [[Take-Two Interactive]].{{sfn|Kushner|2012|p=98}}\n\nOne of the changes made shortly after 9/11 was the colour scheme of the [[police cars]]; the original colour scheme of blue with white stripes specifically resembled that of the [[New York City Police Department]]. It was changed to black-and-white designs common among several police departments in the United States, such as [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco]]. Other changes include altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper, removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio.<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\"/>\n\nAnother cut to the game is the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city's economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game's code, speculation arose that the character was related to 9/11, however Dan Houser explained that the character had been cut \"months before [release]\".<ref name=\"Eurogamer 911\"/> There are also reports and previews stating that the game featured school children as pedestrians prior to release,<ref name=\"GameSpot Impressions\"/> although Rockstar has dismissed such rumours as \"nonsense\".<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/>\n\nRockstar stated that the game was \"about 1% different\" after 9/11, and that the biggest change was the cover art. They felt that the original cover, which was ultimately released as the cover in Europe, felt \"too raw\" after 9/11, and was changed into what became the \"signature style\" of the series.<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/> Sam Houser claims that the cover was designed in an evening, and was instantly preferred over the original cover.<ref name=\"Edge LCS\"/> The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"Questions 2\"/>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n\n=== Initial release ===\n{{Video game reviews\n| title   = PlayStation 2 version reception\n| MC      = 97/100<ref name=\"MC\"/>\n| 1UP     = A+<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"AllGame Review\"/>\n| Edge    = 8/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG   = 10/10<ref name=\"Eurogamer Review\"/>\n| GamePro = 5/5<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev = A<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GI      = 9.5/10<ref name=\"Game Informer Review\"/>\n| GSpot   = 9.6/10<ref name=\"GameSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy    = 94/100<ref name=\"GameSpy Review\"/>\n| IGN     = 9.6/10<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n}}\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was released to critical acclaim.

This was met with widespread controversy.<ref name=\"Telegraph Memorable\"/> The game also received controversy for its depiction of crime, and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist [[David Walsh (psychologist)|David Walsh]] of the [[National Institute on Media and the Family]] stated that the game \"glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity\",<ref name=\"USAToday Glorifies\"/> and that \"the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\"/> In response, ''[[Kotaku]]'' writer Owen Good wrote that the game does not reward players for \"proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Scapegoat\"/> Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' noted the \"adrenaline\" that players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing the game's violence due to its mature classification.<ref name=\"Boston Globe\"/> The [[National Organization for Women]] spoke out against the game in January 2002, asking Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it \"encourages violence and the degradation of women\".<ref name=\"Morality\"/> [[Matt Richtel]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the activities within the game \"crossed the line into bad taste\".<ref name=\"NYT\"/>\n\n''Grand Theft Auto III'' was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] (OFLC) [[List of banned video games in Australia|banned it]], due to its depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus Ban\"/><ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\"/> This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive to appeal to the OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two to recall the game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.<ref name=\"GameSpot Aus\"/> The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing \"sexual activities related to incentives and rewards\".<ref name=\"Kotaku Aus\"/>\n\nOn 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot and killed Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede.

Only legal residents of [[American Samoa]] who have graduated from high school or obtained a [[General Equivalency Diploma]] are admitted to ASCC.\n\nIt is American Samoa's only [[tertiary education]] institution. The main Mapusaga campus has a variety of two-year programs. Also associated with the college are a nursing school at [[LBJ Hospital (American Samoa)|LBJ Hospital]] and vocational facilities in the [[Tafuna, American Samoa|Tafuna]] Industrial Complex.<ref>Swaney, Deanna (1994).\u00a0''Samoa: Western & American Samoa: a Lonely Planet Travel Survival Kit''.

In 2016, the college had 1,254 enrolled full-time students and 553 enrolled part-time. Around 27 percent majored in liberal arts but other popular majors were business management, accounting, criminal justice, education, nursing and health science.<ref>http://doc.as.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/American-Samoa-Statistical-Yearbook-2016.pdf (Page 44)</ref>\n\n==History==\nAmerican Samoa Community College was established in 1970. It started its first year with 474 attending school in [[Utulei]] at the old navy buildings that once were the [[High School of American Samoa]] (now [[Samoana High School]]). Enrollment increased to 550 in the fall of 1971 and 872 by the spring of 1972. The college originally offered an associate degree and transfer to baccalaureate-granting colleges. It offered vocational, teacher, adult education and manpower training. Nurse training was added in 1976. The college was granted one-year accreditation in 1973 and received entitlement to funds under the Higher Education Act of 1963. When [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] closed its [[Mapusaga, American Samoa|Mapusaga]] High School in 1974, the government of American Samoa purchased the buildings for $1.5 million, signed a 50-year lease for the 20-acre property, and moved the college here. The college received accreditation from the Commission of Junior Colleges, [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] in 1976. The college's new wing was constructed in 1978 at a cost of $3.5 million. ASCC received a $1.5 million federal grant in 1978 in order to establish a Teacher Corps project to improve the teaching quality.<ref>Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). ''A History of American Samoa''. Amerika Samoa Humanities Council. Pages 307-308. {{ISBN|9781573062992}}.</ref>\n\nThe college was established in 1970 as part of the [[American Samoa Department of Education]] to provide residents the opportunity to enjoy postsecondary education in the [[liberal arts]], [[teacher training]], vocational-technical education, and general education.  The first freshman class had only 131 students. The school moved into a few buildings on the island before moving permanently to its current location in Mapusaga in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsamoa.edu/aboutascc.html |title=ABOUT ASCC |website=American Samoa Community College}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] provided a grant that allowed the college to add five modern buildings for the [[fine arts]], [[nursing]], [[science]], and [[vocation|vocational training]].  ASCC was also able to add a [[cafeteria]] and a [[gym]]nasium. A new [[library]] was added in 2003. New administrative offices, lecture hall and two new teacher education classrooms were added in 2008. The computer and science labs were renovated and upgraded with funding from the [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]] in 2011. Groundbreaking for the Multi-Purpose Center was initiated in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsamoa.edu/aboutascc.html |title=ABOUT ASCC |website=American Samoa Community College}}</ref>\n\nThe Health Care Center at ASCC opened in November 1985. The college also began a program to enable local nurses to take national tests as registered and licensed practical nurses.<ref>Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). ''A History of American Samoa''.

It is accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges]].\n\n==Student body==\n93 percent of students are residents of American Samoa, however, 24 percent have [[Western Samoa]] citizenship. Roughly 23 percent are over the age of 26. Around 75 percent of enrolled students are full-time students, while first-year students make up 47 percent of the total student body.<ref>Crocombe, R.G. and Malama Meleisea (1988).\u00a0''Pacific Universities:\u00a0Achievements, Problems, Prospects''.

It started its first year with 474 attending school in [[Utulei]] at the old navy buildings that once were the [[High School of American Samoa]] (now [[Samoana High School]]). Enrollment increased to 550 in the fall of 1971 and 872 by the spring of 1972. The college originally offered an associate degree and transfer to baccalaureate-granting colleges. It offered vocational, teacher, adult education and manpower training. Nurse training was added in 1976. The college was granted one-year accreditation in 1973 and received entitlement to funds under the Higher Education Act of 1963. When [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] closed its [[Mapusaga, American Samoa|Mapusaga]] High School in 1974, the government of American Samoa purchased the buildings for $1.5 million, signed a 50-year lease for the 20-acre property, and moved the college here. The college received accreditation from the Commission of Junior Colleges, [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] in 1976. The college's new wing was constructed in 1978 at a cost of $3.5 million. ASCC received a $1.5 million federal grant in 1978 in order to establish a Teacher Corps project to improve the teaching quality.<ref>Sunia, Fofo I.F. (2009). ''A History of American Samoa''.

Pages 307-308. {{ISBN|9781573062992}}.</ref>\n\nThe college was established in 1970 as part of the [[American Samoa Department of Education]] to provide residents the opportunity to enjoy postsecondary education in the [[liberal arts]], [[teacher training]], vocational-technical education, and general education.  The first freshman class had only 131 students. The school moved into a few buildings on the island before moving permanently to its current location in Mapusaga in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsamoa.edu/aboutascc.html |title=ABOUT ASCC |website=American Samoa Community College}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] provided a grant that allowed the college to add five modern buildings for the [[fine arts]], [[nursing]], [[science]], and [[vocation|vocational training]].  ASCC was also able to add a [[cafeteria]] and a [[gym]]nasium. A new [[library]] was added in 2003. New administrative offices, lecture hall and two new teacher education classrooms were added in 2008. The computer and science labs were renovated and upgraded with funding from the [[American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]] in 2011. Groundbreaking for the Multi-Purpose Center was initiated in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsamoa.edu/aboutascc.html |title=ABOUT ASCC |website=American Samoa Community College}}</ref>\n\nThe Health Care Center at ASCC opened in November 1985.
