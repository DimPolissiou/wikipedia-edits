Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may \"know\" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the \"messengers\" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to \"do worse\" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, \"so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\" (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])\n\nIn current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.<ref>[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}</ref> These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v.

In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]\u2014human sexuality and the anus\u2014without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.\n\nIn modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].<ref>See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].</ref> The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWhile religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that \"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways.\"<ref>Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Buggery===\nThe modern English word \"[[bugger]]\" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or \"Bulgarian\". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word \"buggery\" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with \"abominable heresy\"; though the sexual sense of \"bugger\" is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\n''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: \"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]\". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as a sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while \"buggery\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\nIn the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction \u2014 and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction \u2014 appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.<ref>Boswell, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\nIn [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.\nNeither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.\n\nMany times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.\n\nSpecific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).\n\nIn Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. \"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.\" (v. 47, NASB) \"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49\u201350, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word \"thus\" is the conjunction \"\u05d5\" which is usually translated \"and\", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)\n\nThere is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and \"abomination\" is used to describe many sins.\n\nThe [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel,\" but the word corresponding to \"sodomite\" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as \"[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]\"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Anderson\n  | first = Ray Sherman\n  | title = The shape of practical theology: empowering ministry with theological praxis\n  | publisher = InterVarsity Press\n  | year = 2001\n  | page = 267\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CagagOo11-QC&pg=PA267\n  | isbn = 978-0-8308-1559-3}}\n</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Jewett\n  | first = Paul\n  | last2 = Shuster\n  | first2 = Marguerite\n  | title = Who we are: our dignity as human : a neo-evangelical theology\n  | publisher = Wm.

As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as \"sexual immorality\".\n\nThe Greek words for \"strange flesh\" are \"heteros\", which almost always basically denotes \"another/other\", and \"sarx\",  a common word for \"flesh\", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.\n\nIn the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall \"filthy\" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word (\"aselgeiais\") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).\n\n====Epistle of Jude====\nThe [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: \"just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire\". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered \"sexual immorality and unnatural desire\" is translated \"strange flesh\" or \"false flesh\", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.\n\nOne theory is that it is just a reference to the \"strange flesh\" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.<ref>Boswell, p. 97</ref> Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,<ref>Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible</ref><ref>Vincent's Word Studies</ref>  \"out of the order of nature.\"<ref>Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A.

While adhering to the death penalty by beheading as punishment for homosexuality or adultery, Justinian's legal novels heralded a change in Roman legal paradigm<ref>For the legal and cultural background in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] prior to Christian rule, see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] and ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''.</ref> in that he introduced a concept of not only secular but also divine punishment for homosexual behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nChristians earlier than Justinian are also seen to denounce same-sex relations. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the 4th century regarded such as worse than murder in his fourth homily on {{bibleverse||Romans|1:26-27|KJV}} [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/210204.htm], while [[Paul the Apostle]] in the ''[[Epistle to the Romans]]'' referred to same sex relations as ''\"shameful lust\"'' and which acts were contrary to nature,  with men suffering a ''\"due penalty\"'' in their bodies.

Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:\n\n*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' (\"No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs\")\n*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' (\"No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them\")\n*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' (\"No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds\")\n\nBurning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[N\u012b\u00fe|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]\nBenedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.\n\nThis came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].<ref>G. Legman \"The Guilt of the Templars\" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.</ref>  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W. A. P.|authorlink=Walter Alison Phillips}}</ref>\n\nPersecution of Cathars and the [[Bogomiles]] sect in [[Bulgaria]] led to the use of a term closely related to ''sodomy'': ''buggery'' derives from French ''bouggerie'', meaning \"of Bulgaria\".<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> The association of ''sodomy'' with hereticism, satanism, and witchcraft was supported by the Inquisition trials.{{cn|date=September 2019}} \n\nThe [[Book of Wisdom]], which is included in the Biblical canon by Orthodox and Roman Catholics, but excluded by modern Jews, Protestants, and other Christian denominations, makes reference to the story of Sodom, further emphasizing that their sin had been failing to practice hospitality:\n\n:\"And punishments came upon the sinners not without former signs by the force of thunders: for they suffered justly according to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers.\"\n:\"For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.\" ([[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/bible/kjv.Wis.19.html#Wis.19.13 Wisdom 19:13-14])\n\n===Sodomy laws in 18th-century Europe===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n[[File:Amsterdam sodomites 1730.png|thumb|upright|A [[wanted poster]], published in the city of [[Amsterdam]] in 1730, accusing ten men of \"the abominable crime of sodomy\" ({{lang|nl|de verfoeyelyke Crimen van Sodomie}})]]\n\nAn examination of trials for rape and sodomy during the 18th century at the [[Old Bailey]] in London shows that the treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of sodomy was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#assaultwithsodomiticalintent Crimes tried at the Old Bailey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602121130/https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp |date=2017-06-02 }}, ''Proceedings of the Old Bailey'' online</ref>  Sodomy crimes in England could mean \"sexually assaulting a young child\" and could result in a sentence of [[death recorded]], i.e., not an actual death sentence at all.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zipporah Osei |title=An Author Learned of a Mortifying Research Mistake Live on the Radio.

However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize \"this vice\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nPeriodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nIn 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing.

Two angels are invited by [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]] to take refuge with his family for the night. The men of Sodom surround Lot's house and demand that he bring the messengers out so that they may \"know\" them (the expression includes sexual connotations). Lot protests that the \"messengers\" are his guests and offers the Sodomites his virgin daughters instead, but then they threaten to \"do worse\" with Lot than they would with his guests. Then the angels strike the Sodomites blind, \"so that they wearied themselves to find the door.\" (Genesis 19:4-11, [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]])\n\nIn current usage, the term is particularly used in law. [[Sodomy law|Laws]] prohibiting sodomy were seen frequently in past Jewish, Christian, and Islamic civilizations, but the term has little modern usage outside Africa, Asia, and the United States.<ref>[http://www.sodomylaws.org/ sodomy laws] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704130716/http://www.sodomylaws.org/ |date=2007-07-04 }}</ref> These laws in the United States have been challenged and have sometimes been found unconstitutional or been replaced with different legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html|title=''Lawrence v.

In those languages, the term is also often current [[vernacular]] (not just legal, unlike in other cultures) and a formal way of referring to any practice of anal penetration; the word ''sex'' is commonly associated with consent and pleasure with regard to all involved parties and often avoids directly mentioning two common aspects of social [[taboo]]\u2014human sexuality and the anus\u2014without a shunning or archaic connotation to its use.\n\nIn modern [[German language|German]], the word {{lang|de|[[:de:Sodomie|Sodomie]]}} has no connotation of anal or oral sex and specifically refers to [[zoophilia|bestiality]].<ref>See [[Paragraph 175#Version of June 28.2C 1935|Paragraph 175 StGB, version of June 28, 1935]].</ref> The same goes for the [[Polish language|Polish]] {{lang|pl|[[:pl:sodomia|sodomia]]}}.

''Sod'' is used as slang in the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and is considered mildly offensive. However, in New Zealand and Australia it is not considered offensive at all, but only 'coarse', because it is locally assumed, even if incorrectly, that it refers to 'sod' as in a wet clump of dirt.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nWhile religion and the law have had a fundamental role in the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that \"an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' heterosexualities ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways.\"<ref>Ian McCormick, ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing.'' (London and New York: Routledge), p. 9, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Buggery===\nThe modern English word \"[[bugger]]\" is derived from the French term ''{{lang|fr|bougre}}'', that evolved from the [[Latin]] ''[[Bulgars|Bulgarus]]'' or \"Bulgarian\". The [[Catholic Church]] used the word to describe members of a religious [[sect]] known as the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], who originated in [[Bulgarian Empire|medieval Bulgaria]] in the 10th Century and spread throughout [[Western Europe]] by the 15th Century. The Church used it as a term of offence against a group they considered [[heretic]]al. The first use of the word \"buggery\" appears in [[Middle English]] in 1330 where it is associated with \"abominable heresy\"; though the sexual sense of \"bugger\" is not recorded until 1555.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24372?redirectedFrom=buggery#eid}}</ref>\n''The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology'' quotes a similar form: \"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. [[Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian]]\". Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as a sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Bogomilism Study |url=http://www.bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810053756/http://bogomilism.eu/Studies/Bugger%20case.html |archivedate=2015-08-10 |df= }}</ref>\n\n''Bugger'' is still commonly used in modern English as an exclamation, while \"buggery\" is synonymous with the act of sodomy.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hebrew Bible===\nIn the Hebrew Bible, [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was a city destroyed by God because of the evil of its inhabitants. No specific sin is given as the reason for God's great wrath. The story of Sodom's destruction \u2014 and of [[Abraham]]'s failed attempt to intercede with God and prevent that destruction \u2014 appears in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18-19.  The connection between Sodom and homosexuality is derived from the described attempt by a mob of the city's people to rape [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s male guests. Some suggest the sinfulness for which Sodom was destroyed might have consisted mainly in the violation of obligations of hospitality, which were important for the original writers of the Biblical account.<ref>Boswell, pp. 92\u201398</ref>\nIn [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 19-21, there is an account, similar in many ways, where Gibeah, a city of the Benjamin tribe, is destroyed by the other tribes of Israel in revenge for a mob of its inhabitants raping and killing a woman.\nNeither view about why Sodom was destroyed takes into account the fact that its destruction was planned before the guests arrived in the city, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:17.\n\nMany times in the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] and [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], writers use God's destruction of Sodom to demonstrate His awesome power. This happens in [[Deuteronomy]] 29; [[Isaiah]] 1, 3, and 13; [[Jeremiah]] 49 and 50; [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 4.11; and [[Zephaniah]] 2.9. Deuteronomy 32, Jeremiah 23.14, and Lamentations 4 reference the sinfulness of Sodom but do not specify any particular sin.\n\nSpecific sins which Sodom is linked to by the prophets of the Old Testament are [[adultery]] and [[lie|lying]] ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:14|KJV|}}).\n\nIn Ezekiel 16, a long comparison is made between Sodom and the [[kingdom of Judah]]. \"Yet you have not merely walked in their ways or done according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you acted more corruptly in all your conduct than they.\" (v. 47, NASB) \"Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had arrogance, abundant food and careless ease, but she did not help the poor and needy. Thus they were haughty and committed abominations before Me. (vss. 49\u201350, NASB) (Note that the Hebrew for the word \"thus\" is the conjunction \"\u05d5\" which is usually translated \"and\", thus KJV, NIV, and CEV omit the word entirely.)\n\nThere is no explicit mention of any sexual sin in Ezekiel's summation and \"abomination\" is used to describe many sins.\n\nThe [[Authorized King James Version]] translates {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|23:17|KJV}} as \"There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel,\" but the word corresponding to \"sodomite\" in the Hebrew original, Qadesh ([[Hebrew]]:\u05e7\u05d3\u05e9), does not refer to Sodom and has been translated in the [[New International Version]] as \"[[Sacred prostitution|shrine prostitute]]\"; male shrine prostitutes may have served barren women in fertility rites rather than engaging in homosexual acts; this also applies to other instances of the word sodomite in the King James Version.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Anderson\n  | first = Ray Sherman\n  | title = The shape of practical theology: empowering ministry with theological praxis\n  | publisher = InterVarsity Press\n  | year = 2001\n  | page = 267\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CagagOo11-QC&pg=PA267\n  | isbn = 978-0-8308-1559-3}}\n</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Jewett\n  | first = Paul\n  | last2 = Shuster\n  | first2 = Marguerite\n  | title = Who we are: our dignity as human : a neo-evangelical theology\n  | publisher = Wm.

As one word it is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, but occurs in the [[Septuagint]] to denote whoredom (Genesis 38:24 and Exodus 34:15). Some modern translations as the [[NIV]] render it as \"sexual immorality\".\n\nThe Greek words for \"strange flesh\" are \"heteros\", which almost always basically denotes \"another/other\", and \"sarx\",  a common word for \"flesh\", and usually refers to the physical body or the nature of man or of an ordinance.\n\nIn the Christian expansion of the prophets, they further linked Sodom to the sins of [[impenitence]] ({{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|KJV|}}), careless living ({{bibleverse||Luke|17:28|KJV|}}), [[fornication]] ({{bibleverse||Jude|1:7|KJV|}} [[KJV]]), and an overall \"filthy\" lifestyle ({{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:7|KJV|}}), which word (\"aselgeiais\") elsewhere is rendered in the KJV as [[lasciviousness]] ({{bibleverse||Mark|7:22|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:21|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Ephesians|4:19|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:3|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse||Jude|1:4|KJV|}}) or [[incontinence (philosophy)|wantonness]] ({{bibleverse||Romans|13:13|KJV|}}; {{bibleverse|2|Peter|2:18|KJV|}}).\n\n====Epistle of Jude====\nThe [[Epistle of Jude]] in the New Testament echoes the Genesis narrative and potentially adds the sexually immoral aspects of Sodom's sins: \"just as [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire\". (v. 7, English Standard Version). The phrase rendered \"sexual immorality and unnatural desire\" is translated \"strange flesh\" or \"false flesh\", but it is not entirely clear what it refers to.\n\nOne theory is that it is just a reference to the \"strange flesh\" of the intended rape victims, who were angels, not men.<ref>Boswell, p. 97</ref> Countering this is traditional interpretation, which notes that the angels were sent to investigate an ongoing regional problem(Gn. 18) of fornication, and extraordinarily so, that of a homosexual nature,<ref>Albert Barnes' Notes on the Bible</ref><ref>Vincent's Word Studies</ref>  \"out of the order of nature.\"<ref>Commentary on the Old and New Testaments by Robert Jamieson, A.

Benedict's three capitularies particularly dealing with Justinian's interpretation of the story of Sodom were:\n\n*''XXI. De diversis malorum flagitiis.'' (\"No. 21: On manifold disgraceful wrongs\")\n*''CXLIII. De sceleribus nefandis ob quae regna percussa sunt, ut penitus caveantur.'' (\"No. 143: On sinful vices due to which empires have crumbled, so that we shall do our best to beware of them\")\n*''CLX. De patratoribus diversorum malorum.'' (\"No. 160: On the perpetrators of manifold evil deeds\")\n\nBurning had been part of the standard penalty for homosexual behavior particularly common in Germanic [[protohistory]] (as according to Germanic folklore, sexual deviance and especially same-sex desire were caused by a form of malevolence or spiritual evil called ''[[N\u012b\u00fe|nith]]'', rendering those people characterized by it as non-human fiends, as ''nithings''), and Benedictus most probably was of the Germanic tribe of the Franks.{{cn|date=September 2019}} Benedict broadened the meaning for ''sodomy'' to all sexual acts not related to procreation that were therefore deemed ''counter nature'' (so for instance, even solitary masturbation and anal intercourse between a male and a female were covered), while among these he still emphasized all interpersonal acts not taking place between human men and women, especially homosexuality.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n[[File:Execution Sodomites Ghent 1578 (1).jpg|thumb|Monks accused of sodomy burned at the stake, [[Ghent]] 1578]]\nBenedict's rationale was that the punishment of such acts was in order to protect all Christianity from divine punishments such as natural disasters for carnal sins committed by individuals, but also for heresy, superstition and heathenry. Because his crucial demands for capital punishment had been so unheard of in ecclesiastical history priorly based upon the humane Christian concept of forgiveness and mercy, it took several centuries before Benedict's demands for legal reform began to take tangible shape within larger ecclesiastical initiatives.\n\nThis came about with the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in 1184. The sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were a common target, and these heretics were not only persecuted for alleged satanism but were increasingly accused of fornication and sodomy.  In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges levelled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].  Some of these charges were specifically directed at the Grand Master of the order, [[Jacques de Molay]].<ref>G. Legman \"The Guilt of the Templars\" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.</ref>  It is this event which led into the medieval and early-modern [[witch hunts]] that were also largely connoted with sodomy.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Templars|author=W.

However, in several of these, other crimes were involved as well. Records from the Bastille and the police lieutenant d'Argenson, as well as other sources, show that many who were arrested were exiled, sent to a regiment, or imprisoned in places (generally the Hospital) associated with moral crimes such as prostitution. Of these, a number were involved in prostitution or had approached children, or otherwise gone beyond merely having homosexual relations. Ravaisson (a 19th-century writer who edited the Bastille records) suggested that the authorities preferred to handle these cases discreetly, lest public punishments in effect publicize \"this vice\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nPeriodicals of the time sometimes casually named known sodomites, and at one point even suggested that sodomy was increasingly popular. This does not imply that sodomites necessarily lived in security - specific police agents, for instance, watched the [[Tuileries]], even then a known cruising area. But, as with much sexual behaviour under the Old Regime, discretion was a key concern on all sides (especially since members of prominent families were sometimes implicated) - the law seemed most concerned with those who were the least discreet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=since April 2010 section template}}\n\nIn 1730, there was a wave of sodomy trials in the [[Netherlands]]; some 250 men were summoned before the authorities; 91 faced decrees of exile for not appearing.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Recording==\nThe backing track for \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was recorded at [[Trident Studios]] in London on 4 May 1970, along with other album track \"Running Gun Blues\". At this point, the track was recorded under the working title \"Saviour Machine\" and did not contain the title phrase.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=191\u2013192}} According to producer [[Tony Visconti]], Bowie recorded his vocal on 22 May at [[Advision Studios]], the final day of mixing for the album which, when traveling to Advision, Bowie had intended to name ''Metrobolist'', an homage to [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=193}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=316}} Bowie's last-minute addition frustrated Visconti, who recalled in 1977: \"This was the beginning of [Bowie's] new style of writing \u2013 'I can't be bothered until I have to'. When it was finished, on the last day of the last mix, I remember telling David, 'I've had it, I can't work like this anymore \u2013 I'm through...David was very disappointed.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=193\u2013194}} This frustration was mostly due in part to his dissatisfaction with the recording sessions: he was mostly in charge of budget and production, as well as maintaining Bowie's interest in the project. Bowie later told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s Stuart Grundy in 1976: \"It was a nightmare, that album. I hated the actual process of making it.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme ''ChangesNowBowie'', broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet. You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Other releases by Bowie==\n*\"The Man Who Sold the World\" appeared as the B-side on the American single release of the song  \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1973 rerelease) and British single \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" (1973).<ref name=\"1973 US single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Space Oddity\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=US|type=Single liner notes|id=74-0876}}</ref><ref name=\"1973 UK single liner notes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=''\"Life on Mars?\"''|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1973|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=Single liner notes|id=RCA 2316}}</ref> It also appears on various Bowie compilations such as ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'' (1989), ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'' (1997), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n*On 15 December 1979, Bowie recorded the song for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' broadcast, with [[Klaus Nomi]] and [[Joey Arias]].
