As a gas, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor.  Upon condensation, the gas converts to various other forms of formaldehyde (with different chemical formulas) that are of more practical value. One derivative is the cyclic [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] metaformaldehyde ([[1,3,5-trioxane]]) with the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>. There is also a linear polymer called [[paraformaldehyde]]. These compounds have similar chemical properties and are often used interchangeably.\n\n[[File:Paraformaldehyd.svg|left|thumb|[[Paraformaldehyde]] is a common form of formaldehyde for industrial applications.]]\n\nWhen dissolved in water, formaldehyde also forms a hydrate, [[methanediol]], with the formula {{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>}}. This compound also exists in equilibrium with various [[oligomer]]s (short polymers), depending on the concentration and temperature. A saturated water solution, of about 40% formaldehyde by volume or 37% by mass, is called \"100% '''formalin'''\". A small amount of [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], such as [[methanol]], is usually added to suppress [[oxidation]] and [[polymerization]]. A typical commercial grade formalin may contain 10\u201312% methanol in addition to various metallic impurities. \"Formaldehyde\" was first used as a [[generic trademark]] in 1893 following a previous trade name, \"formalin\".<ref>{{Citation | title = Formalin | publisher = Merriam-Webster, Inc. | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formalin|date=15 January 2020 | accessdate = 18 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Occurrence==\nProcesses in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] contribute up to 90% of the total formaldehyde in the environment. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the oxidation (or [[combustion]]) of [[methane]], as well as of other carbon compounds, e.g. in [[forest fire]]s, [[automobile]] exhaust, and [[tobacco smoke]]. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and [[oxygen]] on [[atmospheric methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, it becomes part of [[smog]]. Formaldehyde has also been detected in outer space (see below).\n\nFormaldehyde and its [[adducts]] are ubiquitous in living organisms.

The most common catalysts are [[silver]] metal or a mixture of an [[iron oxide|iron]] and [[molybdenum trioxide|molybdenum]] or [[vanadium pentoxide|vanadium]] [[oxide]]s. In the commonly used [[formox process]], methanol and oxygen react at ca.&nbsp;250\u2013400&nbsp;\u00b0C in presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the [[chemical equation]]:<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>\n:2 CH<sub>3</sub>OH + O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192  2 CH<sub>2</sub>O + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe silver-based catalyst usually operates at a higher temperature, about 650&nbsp;\u00b0C. Two chemical reactions on it simultaneously produce formaldehyde: that shown above and the [[dehydrogenation]] reaction:\n:CH<sub>3</sub>OH \u2192 CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIn principle, formaldehyde could be generated by oxidation of [[methane]], but this route is not industrially viable because the methanol is more easily oxidized than methane.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>\n\n==Organic chemistry==\nFormaldehyde is a building block in the synthesis of many other compounds of specialised and industrial significance. It exhibits most of the chemical properties of other aldehydes but is more reactive.\n\n===Self-condensation and hydration===\nFormaldehyde, unlike most aldehydes, oligomerizes spontaneously. The trimer is [[1,3,5-trioxane]], and the polymer is called [[paraformaldehyde]]. Many cyclic oligomers have been isolated.  Similarly, formaldehyde hydrates to give the geminal diol [[methanediol]], which condenses further to form oligomers HO(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub>H. Monomeric CH<sub>2</sub>O is rarely encountered.\n\n===Oxidation===\nIt is readily [[oxidation|oxidized]] by atmospheric oxygen into [[formic acid]].  For this reason, commercial formaldehyde is typically contaminated with formic acid.\n\n===Hydroxymethylation and chloromethylation===\nFormaldehyde is a good [[electrophile]]. With good nucleophiles such as thiols, amines, and even amides, no acid catalyst is required.  The resulting hydroxymethyl derivatives typically react further. Thus amines give [[hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine]]s. Similarly, when combined with [[hydrogen sulfide]], it forms [[trithiane]].<ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Bost|first1=R. W.|last2=Constable|first2=E.

These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.\n\nFormaldehyde levels in air can be sampled and tested in several ways, including impinger, treated sorbent, and passive monitors.<ref>{{cite web | title = When Sampling Formaldehyde, The Medium Matters | url = http://www.galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=18 | publisher = Galson Labs | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110323024935/http://www.galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=18 | archivedate = 2011-03-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has measurement methods numbered 2016, 2541, 3500, and 3800.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2018-11-29 | title = NIOSH Pocket Gide to Chemical Hazards: Formaldehyde | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190328010408/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html | archivedate = 2019-03-28 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nStudies on the interactions between formaldehyde and proteins at the molecular level have been reported on the effects of the body's carrier protein, [[serum albumin]].

As a gas, formaldehyde is colorless and has a characteristic pungent, irritating odor.  Upon condensation, the gas converts to various other forms of formaldehyde (with different chemical formulas) that are of more practical value. One derivative is the cyclic [[trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] metaformaldehyde ([[1,3,5-trioxane]]) with the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>. There is also a linear polymer called [[paraformaldehyde]]. These compounds have similar chemical properties and are often used interchangeably.\n\n[[File:Paraformaldehyd.svg|left|thumb|[[Paraformaldehyde]] is a common form of formaldehyde for industrial applications.]]\n\nWhen dissolved in water, formaldehyde also forms a hydrate, [[methanediol]], with the formula {{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>C(OH)<sub>2</sub>}}. This compound also exists in equilibrium with various [[oligomer]]s (short polymers), depending on the concentration and temperature. A saturated water solution, of about 40% formaldehyde by volume or 37% by mass, is called \"100% '''formalin'''\". A small amount of [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], such as [[methanol]], is usually added to suppress [[oxidation]] and [[polymerization]]. A typical commercial grade formalin may contain 10\u201312% methanol in addition to various metallic impurities. \"Formaldehyde\" was first used as a [[generic trademark]] in 1893 following a previous trade name, \"formalin\".<ref>{{Citation | title = Formalin | publisher = Merriam-Webster, Inc. | url = https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formalin|date=15 January 2020 | accessdate = 18 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Occurrence==\nProcesses in the upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] contribute up to 90% of the total formaldehyde in the environment. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the oxidation (or [[combustion]]) of [[methane]], as well as of other carbon compounds, e.g. in [[forest fire]]s, [[automobile]] exhaust, and [[tobacco smoke]]. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and [[oxygen]] on [[atmospheric methane]] and other [[hydrocarbon]]s, it becomes part of [[smog]]. Formaldehyde has also been detected in outer space (see below).\n\nFormaldehyde and its [[adducts]] are ubiquitous in living organisms.  It is formed in the metabolism of endogenous amino acids{{which|date=January 2018}} and is found in the bloodstream of humans and other primates at concentrations of approximately 0.1&nbsp;millimolar.<ref>{{cite book | ref=harv | last = National Research Council | year = 2014 | url = http://www.nap.edu/download.php?record_id=18948# | url-access = registration | format = [[PDF]] | title = Review of the Formaldehyde Assessment in the National Toxicology Program 12th Report on Carcinogens | page = 91 | doi = 10.17226/18948 | pmid = 25340250 | isbn = 978-0-309-31227-1 | location = Washington, DC | publisher = The National Academies Press }}</ref> Experiments in which animals are exposed to an atmosphere containing isotopically labeled formaldehyde have demonstrated that even in deliberately exposed animals, the majority of formaldehyde-DNA adducts found in non-respiratory tissues are derived from endogenously produced formaldehyde.<ref>{{harvp | National Research Council | 2014 | p = 95 }}</ref>\n\nFormaldehyde does not accumulate in the environment, because it is broken down within a few hours by sunlight or by bacteria present in soil or water.

The most common catalysts are [[silver]] metal or a mixture of an [[iron oxide|iron]] and [[molybdenum trioxide|molybdenum]] or [[vanadium pentoxide|vanadium]] [[oxide]]s. In the commonly used [[formox process]], methanol and oxygen react at ca.&nbsp;250\u2013400&nbsp;\u00b0C in presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the [[chemical equation]]:<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>\n:2 CH<sub>3</sub>OH + O<sub>2</sub>  \u2192  2 CH<sub>2</sub>O + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe silver-based catalyst usually operates at a higher temperature, about 650&nbsp;\u00b0C. Two chemical reactions on it simultaneously produce formaldehyde: that shown above and the [[dehydrogenation]] reaction:\n:CH<sub>3</sub>OH \u2192 CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIn principle, formaldehyde could be generated by oxidation of [[methane]], but this route is not industrially viable because the methanol is more easily oxidized than methane.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>\n\n==Organic chemistry==\nFormaldehyde is a building block in the synthesis of many other compounds of specialised and industrial significance. It exhibits most of the chemical properties of other aldehydes but is more reactive.\n\n===Self-condensation and hydration===\nFormaldehyde, unlike most aldehydes, oligomerizes spontaneously. The trimer is [[1,3,5-trioxane]], and the polymer is called [[paraformaldehyde]]. Many cyclic oligomers have been isolated.  Similarly, formaldehyde hydrates to give the geminal diol [[methanediol]], which condenses further to form oligomers HO(CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>''n''</sub>H. Monomeric CH<sub>2</sub>O is rarely encountered.\n\n===Oxidation===\nIt is readily [[oxidation|oxidized]] by atmospheric oxygen into [[formic acid]].  For this reason, commercial formaldehyde is typically contaminated with formic acid.\n\n===Hydroxymethylation and chloromethylation===\nFormaldehyde is a good [[electrophile]]. With good nucleophiles such as thiols, amines, and even amides, no acid catalyst is required.  The resulting hydroxymethyl derivatives typically react further. Thus amines give [[hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine]]s. Similarly, when combined with [[hydrogen sulfide]], it forms [[trithiane]].<ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Bost|first1=R. W.|last2=Constable|first2=E.

These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.\n\nFormaldehyde levels in air can be sampled and tested in several ways, including impinger, treated sorbent, and passive monitors.<ref>{{cite web | title = When Sampling Formaldehyde, The Medium Matters | url = http://www.galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=18 | publisher = Galson Labs | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110323024935/http://www.galsonlabs.com/services/referenceinfo/technical_bulletins.php?tb_id=18 | archivedate = 2011-03-23 | url-status = dead }}</ref> The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has measurement methods numbered 2016, 2541, 3500, and 3800.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2018-11-29 | title = NIOSH Pocket Gide to Chemical Hazards: Formaldehyde | url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190328010408/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0293.html | archivedate = 2019-03-28 | url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nStudies on the interactions between formaldehyde and proteins at the molecular level have been reported on the effects of the body's carrier protein, [[serum albumin]].

However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, [[slimicide]]s, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive.<ref>{{cite web | title = European Union Bans formaldehyde/formalin within Europe | publisher = European Commission's Environment Directorate-General | date = 2007-06-22 | accessdate = 2012-05-19 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biocides/pdf/070622_withdrawal_notice.pdf | pages = 1\u20133 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130427152207/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biocides/pdf/070622_withdrawal_notice.pdf | archivedate = 2013-04-27 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=ESIS (European Chemical Substances Information System) \n |publisher=European Commission Joint Research Centre Institute for Health and Consumer Protection \n |date=February 2009 \n |accessdate=19 May 2012 \n |url=http://esis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101220543/http://esis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ \n |archivedate=1 January 2014 \n}}</ref> In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.<ref name=\"Formaldehyde Releasers\"/>\n\nIn the United States, Congress passed a bill July 7, 2010 regarding the use of formaldehyde in hardwood [[plywood]], [[particle board]], and [[medium density fiberboard]].

It is Japan's [[List of Japanese cities by population|fourth-largest incorporated city]] and the third-most-populous urban area. It is located on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast on central [[Honshu]]. It is the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Aichi Prefecture]] and is one of Japan's major [[seaport|port]]s along with those of [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Kobe]], [[Yokohama]], [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]], and [[Kitakyushu]].

One possible origin is the adjective {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b|nagoyaka}}, meaning 'peaceful'. [http://chimei-allguide.com/23/100.html]\n\nThe name {{Nihongo3||\u4e2d\u4eac|Ch\u016bky\u014d}}, consisting of ''ch\u016b'' (middle) + ''ky\u014d'' (capital) is also used to refer to Nagoya. Notable examples of the use of the name Ch\u016bky\u014d include the [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Industrial Area]], [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Metropolitan Area]], [[Ch\u016bky\u014d Television Broadcasting]], [[Chukyo University]] and the [[Chukyo Racecourse]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Nagoya}}\n\n=== Origin ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n[[Oda Nobunaga]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] were powerful warlords based in the Nagoya area who gradually succeeded in unifying Japan. In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of [[Owari Province]] from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers ({{convert|7|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\n\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the [[Battle of Okehazama]] took place in Dengakuhazama, [[Owari Province]] which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, [[Oda Nobunaga]] defeated [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]] and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>A Military History of Japan by John Kuehn p. 102</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Atsuta Shrine.jpg|The Great [[Atsuta Shrine]], which dates back to c. 100 AD and houses the holy sword [[Kusanagi]], one of the imperial regalia of Japan\nFile:Osu_Kannon_panorama.jpg|[[\u014csu Kannon]] is a Buddhist temple, originally built in 1333\nFile:Bish\u016b Okehazama-gassen.jpg|[[Battle of Okehazama]] (May\u2013June, 1560)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period [[Nagoya Castle]] was constructed, built partly from materials taken from [[Kiyosu Castle]]. During the construction, the entire town around Kiyosu Castle, consisting of around 60,000 people, moved from Kiyosu to the newly planned town around Nagoya Castle.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kiyosu Castle |url=http://www.city.kiyosu.aichi.jp/en/sightseeing01.html |accessdate=2007-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209191819/http://www.city.kiyosu.aichi.jp/en/sightseeing01.html |archivedate=2008-02-09 }}</ref> Around the same time, the nearby ancient [[Atsuta Shrine]] was designated as a [[:wikt:waystation|waystation]], called Miya (the Shrine), on the important [[T\u014dkaid\u014d (road)|T\u014dkaid\u014d]] road, which linked the two capitals of [[Kyoto]] and [[Edo]] (now Tokyo).

Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]].\n\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]] towns of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname]], [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]] and [[Seto, Aichi|Seto]], as well as [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], one of the only places where [[gunpowder]] was produced under the [[shogunate]]. Other industries included [[cotton]] and complex mechanical dolls called ''[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]''.\n\n[[Mitsubishi Aircraft Company]] was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Nagoya Station 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Nagoya Station]] in 1886\nFile:Nagoya-Hirokoji_in_the_Meiji_era.JPG|Hirokoji in Nagoya during the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]]\nFile:\u5fa1\u5927\u5178\u5949\u795d\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a \u6b63\u9580.jpg|thumb|Main Gate of the Nagoya Expo in [[Tsuruma Park]], 1928\nFile:Nagoya map circa 1930.PNG|thumb|Nagoya map circa 1930\nFile:Toyota Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Toyota]] Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938\nFile:TBCN Kakunai Line.JPG|Nagoya in the [[Showa period]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of [[Bombing of Nagoya in World War II|US air raids]] during [[World War II]]. The population of Nagoya at this time was estimated to be 1.5 million, fourth among Japanese cities and one of the three largest centers of the Japanese aircraft industry. It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of [[Kakamigahara, Gifu|Kagamigahara]]. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during [[World War II]].\n\nAir raids began on [[April 18, 1942]], with an [[Doolittle Raid|attack]] on a [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant.<ref>''The First Heroes'' by Craig Nelson</ref> The [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II|bombing]]<nowiki/> continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale [[firebombing]]. Nagoya was the target of two of [[Bomber Command]]\u2019s attacks. These incendiary attacks, one by day and one by night, devastated {{convert|5.9|mi2|1|abbr=out|order=flip}} . The [[XXI Bomber Command]] established a new [[U.S. Army Air Force]] record with the greatest tonnage ever released on a single target in one mission\u20143,162 tons of incendiaries.

The city was built on low-level [[plateau]]s to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The [[Kiso River]] flows to the west along the city border, and the [[Sh\u014dnai River]] comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made [[Hori River (Nagoya)|Hori River]] was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\n\nThe city's location and its position in the [[Ch\u016bbu region|centre of Japan]] allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n=== Wards ===\n[[File:Nagoya_City_Hall_2011-10-28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nagoya City Hall]]]]\n\nNagoya has 16 [[Wards of Japan|wards]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Wards of Nagoya\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!Map of Nagoya \n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!Population\n!''Land area in km<sup>2</sup>''\n!Pop. density\nper km2\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya|Atsuta-ku]]\n|\u71b1\u7530\u533a\n|Blue\n|66,318\n|8.20\n|8,088\n| rowspan=\"16\" |[[File:Nagoya_Wards.png|center|border|400px|A map of Nagoya's Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Chikusa-ku, Nagoya|Chikusa-ku]]\n| \u5343\u7a2e\u533a\n|Brown\n|165,863\n|18.18\n|9,123\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Higashi-ku, Nagoya|Higashi-ku]]\n| \u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|82,939\n|7.71\n|10,757\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita-ku]]\n| \u5317\u533a\n|Purple\n|163,555\n|17.53\n|9,330\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Meit\u014d-ku, Nagoya|Meit\u014d-ku]]\n| \u540d\u6771\u533a\n|Dark blue\n|165,287\n|19.45\n|8,498\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Midori-ku, Nagoya|Midori-ku]]\n| \u7dd1\u533a\n|Light red\n|247,475\n|37.91\n|6,528\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Minami-ku, Nagoya|Minami-ku]]\n| \u5357\u533a\n|Orange\n|136,015\n|18.46\n|7,368\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Minato-ku, Nagoya|Minato-ku]]\n| \u6e2f\u533a\n|Intense Green\n|143,913\n|45.64\n|3,153\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Mizuho-ku, Nagoya|Mizuho-ku]]\n|\u745e\u7a42\u533a\n|Dark purple\n|107,622\n|11.22\n|9,592\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[Moriyama-ku, Nagoya|Moriyama-ku]]\n|\u5b88\u5c71\u533a\n|Light green\n|176,298\n|34.01\n|5,184\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 11\n|[[Naka-ku, Nagoya|Naka-ku]] - administrative center\n|\u4e2d\u533a\n|Green\n|90,918\n|9.38\n|9,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 12\n|[[Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya|Nakagawa-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u5ddd\u533a\n|Pink\n|220,782\n|32.02\n|6,895\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 13\n|[[Nakamura-ku, Nagoya|Nakamura-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u6751\u533a\n|Light blue\n|135,134\n|16.30\n|8,290\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 14\n|[[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]]\n|\u897f\u533a\n|Dark orange\n|150,480\n|17.93\n|8,393\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 15\n|[[Sh\u014dwa-ku, Nagoya|Sh\u014dwa-ku]]\n|\u662d\u548c\u533a\n|Yellow\n|110,436\n|10.94\n|10,095\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 16\n|[[Tenpaku-ku]]\n|\u5929\u767d\u533a\n|Cyan\n|164,522\n|21.58\n|7,624\n|}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Meieki_from_Heiwa_Park_Aqua_Tower.jpg|Nagoya City skyline seen from Heiwa Koen Aqua Tower\nFile:Nagoya_(2015-11-03).JPG|Nagoya in 2015\nFile:Nagoya 2017 (34159008173).jpg|Nagoya city night view\nFile:2016 Japan Nagoya 81 (33038233234).jpg|[[Sakae, Nagoya|Downtown of Sakae Town]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters.

Before and during the [[Edo period]] there were two main kilns in the region: [[Seto ware|Seto]] and [[Tokoname ware|Tokoname]]. In Nagoya Castle a type of ''oniwa-yaki'' (literally \"garden ware\") called [[Ofukei ware]] was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own ''oniwa-yaki'', also to have gifts made. In the town itself [[Toyoraku ware]] and [[Sasashima ware]] [[Japanese tea utensils]] were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord [[Tokugawa Yoshinao]] and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the [[Edo period]]. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as [[Hirasawa Kur\u014d]] and [[Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d]], who made their own pieces.\n\nToyoraku ware continued on until the [[Taish\u014d era]] under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\n\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white [[Kawana ware]]. With the advent of industrialisation during the [[Meiji era]] of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old [[Noritake]], also ''Nagoya E-tsuke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8}}) became popular.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214810/http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |archive-date=2018-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nProduction of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as [[INAX]], [[NGK]], and [[NGK Insulators]].\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]\", are a traditional craft from the area.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially [[Tokugawa Muneharu]], the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\n\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the ''[[Shoin-zukuri]]'' architecture of the feudal era. [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated [[national Treasures of Japan]], including some of the oldest scrolls of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamasa.org's Tokugawa Art Museum page |url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/aichi/tokugawa_artmuseum.html}}</ref> The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of [[Noh theatre]]. The [[Nagoya City Museum]] showcases the history of the town.\n\n[[Y\u014dki-s\u014d]] is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of [[Matsuzakaya]].\n\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the [[Nagoya City Art Museum]]. Modern art is displayed at the [[Aichi Arts Center]]. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], a sister museum to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\n\nThe art of [[porcelain]] and ceramics can be seen at the [[Noritake Garden]]. Toyota has two museums in the city, the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] which shows vintage cars, and the [[Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]], which showcases company history, including its start as a [[textile mill]].\n\nThe [[Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum]] has trams and subway cars, as well as the [[Nagoya City Science Museum]]. The [[SCMaglev and Railway Park]] opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.\n\nOther art museums in Aichi prefecture are the [[Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum]] and the [[Toyota Municipal Museum of Art]]. [[Meiji Mura]] is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the [[Mandolin Melodies Museum]].\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[International Design Centre Nagoya]], the [[Japan Spinning Top Museum]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum]].\n\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"[[Cultural Path]]\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n=== Theatres ===\n[[Noh]] theatre and [[Ky\u014dgen]] date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The [[Nagoya Noh Theater]] at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\n\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's ''[[kabuki]]'' grand stages is [[Misono-za]], which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\n\nIn 1912 the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the [[Nagoya harp]] music instrument.\n\nIn 1992, the large, modern [[Aichi Arts Center]] was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for [[performing art]]s, featuring a main hall that can be used for [[opera]] and theatre and a concert hall. The [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] and holidays, other [[festivals in Nagoya]] are unique to the city/region.\n\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the {{Nihongo|''Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri''|\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d|Street Performer's Festival}} in \u014csu.\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe {{nihongo|[[Nagoya dialect]]|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01|Nagoya-ben}} is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called {{Nihongo|Owari dialect|\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01|Owari-ben}}. The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to [[Japanese language#Official status|standard Japanese]] and to the [[Kansai dialect]], differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of [[Japanese handicrafts]] in the city is centuries old.\n* Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from [[Bungo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\n* ''[[Geta (footwear)|Geta]]'' [[Clog (shoe)|clog]] straps: wooden clogs called ''geta'' were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\n* ''Shippo'': the technique for [[enamelware]] called ''shippo'' arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\n* Candles: [[wax]] is taken from a [[wax tree]] and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (''[[washi]]'') over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the [[Candle wick|wick]] tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\n* ''Yuzen'': the art of [[silk]] dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\n* ''Sekku Ningyo'': festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\n* The city also gave its name to a type of ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', the sash that is used to tie a ''[[kimono]]''. The term ''Nagoya obi'' can refer to an older type of ''obi'' used centuries ago. This type was cord-like.<ref name=\"yoshino\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |title=Kimono |author=Yoshino Antiques |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326233826/http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 }}</ref> The current {{Nihongo3||\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|Nagoya obi}} \u2013 or to differentiate from the ''fukuro Nagoya obi'', also called {{Nihongo3||\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi|extra=\"nine-inch nagoya obi\"}} \u2013 is the most-used ''obi'' type today. It was developed by a seamstress living in Nagoya at the end of the 1920s. The new, easy-to-use obi gained popularity among Tokyo's geisha, from whom it then was adopted by fashionable city women for their everyday wear. The ''Nagoya obi'' was originally for everyday wear, not for ceremonial outfits, but one made from exquisite brocade can be accepted as semi-ceremonial wear.

One possible origin is the adjective {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3054\u3084\u304b|nagoyaka}}, meaning 'peaceful'.

In 1610, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved the capital of [[Owari Province]] from Kiyosu, about seven kilometers ({{convert|7|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) away, to a more strategic location in present-day Nagoya.\n\nIn May\u2013June 1560, the [[Battle of Okehazama]] took place in Dengakuhazama, [[Owari Province]] which was just outside of what would become Nagoya city. In this battle, [[Oda Nobunaga]] defeated [[Imagawa Yoshimoto]] and established himself as one of the leading warlords in the [[Sengoku period]].<ref>A Military History of Japan by John Kuehn p. 102</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Atsuta Shrine.jpg|The Great [[Atsuta Shrine]], which dates back to c. 100 AD and houses the holy sword [[Kusanagi]], one of the imperial regalia of Japan\nFile:Osu_Kannon_panorama.jpg|[[\u014csu Kannon]] is a Buddhist temple, originally built in 1333\nFile:Bish\u016b Okehazama-gassen.jpg|[[Battle of Okehazama]] (May\u2013June, 1560)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Tokugawa period ===\nDuring this period [[Nagoya Castle]] was constructed, built partly from materials taken from [[Kiyosu Castle]].

Nagoya was proclaimed a city on October 1, 1889, and designated a city on September 1, 1956, by [[City designated by government ordinance|government ordinance]].\n\nNagoya became an industrial hub for the region. Its economic sphere included the famous [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|pottery]] towns of [[Tokoname, Aichi|Tokoname]], [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]] and [[Seto, Aichi|Seto]], as well as [[Okazaki, Aichi|Okazaki]], one of the only places where [[gunpowder]] was produced under the [[shogunate]]. Other industries included [[cotton]] and complex mechanical dolls called ''[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]''.\n\n[[Mitsubishi Aircraft Company]] was established in 1920 in Nagoya and became one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in Japan. The availability of space and the central location of the region and the well-established connectivity were some of the major factors that lead to the establishment of the aviation industry there.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Nagoya Station 1886.jpg|thumb|[[Nagoya Station]] in 1886\nFile:Nagoya-Hirokoji_in_the_Meiji_era.JPG|Hirokoji in Nagoya during the [[Meiji (era)|Meiji era]]\nFile:\u5fa1\u5927\u5178\u5949\u795d\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u535a\u89a7\u4f1a \u6b63\u9580.jpg|thumb|Main Gate of the Nagoya Expo in [[Tsuruma Park]], 1928\nFile:Nagoya map circa 1930.PNG|thumb|Nagoya map circa 1930\nFile:Toyota Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938.jpg|thumb|[[Toyota]] Motor Corporation Koromo plant in 1938\nFile:TBCN Kakunai Line.JPG|Nagoya in the [[Showa period]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== World War II and later ===\nNagoya was the target of [[Bombing of Nagoya in World War II|US air raids]] during [[World War II]].

It was estimated that 25% of its workers were engaged in aircraft production. Important Japanese aircraft targets (numbers 193, 194, 198, 2010, and 1729) were within the city itself, while others (notably 240 and 1833) were to the north of [[Kakamigahara, Gifu|Kagamigahara]]. It was estimated that they produced between 40% and 50% of Japanese combat aircraft and engines, such as the vital [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter. The Nagoya area also produced machine tools, bearings, railway equipment, metal alloys, tanks, motor vehicles and processed foods during [[World War II]].\n\nAir raids began on [[April 18, 1942]], with an [[Doolittle Raid|attack]] on a [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] aircraft works, the Matsuhigecho oil warehouse, the Nagoya Castle military barracks and the Nagoya war industries plant.<ref>''The First Heroes'' by Craig Nelson</ref> The [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II|bombing]]<nowiki/> continued through the spring of 1945, and included large-scale [[firebombing]].

The city was built on low-level [[plateau]]s to ward off floodwaters. The plain is one of the nation's most fertile areas. The [[Kiso River]] flows to the west along the city border, and the [[Sh\u014dnai River]] comes from the northeast and turns south towards the bay at Nishi Ward. The man-made [[Hori River (Nagoya)|Hori River]] was constructed as a canal in 1610. It flows from north to south, as part of the Sh\u014dnai River system. The rivers allowed for trade with the hinterland. The Tempaku River feeds from a number of smaller river in the east, flows briefly south at Nonami and then west at \u014cdaka into the bay.\n\nThe city's location and its position in the [[Ch\u016bbu region|centre of Japan]] allowed it to develop economically and politically.\n\n=== Wards ===\n[[File:Nagoya_City_Hall_2011-10-28.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Nagoya City Hall]]]]\n\nNagoya has 16 [[Wards of Japan|wards]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"810px\"\n! colspan=\"8\" | Wards of Nagoya\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | Place Name\n!\n!\n!\n!\n!Map of Nagoya \n|-\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Romanization of Japanese|R\u014dmaji]]\n! style=\"width: 190px;\" |[[Kanji]]\n!Color\n!Population\n!''Land area in km<sup>2</sup>''\n!Pop. density\nper km2\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" \"width: 20px;\" | 1\n|[[Atsuta-ku, Nagoya|Atsuta-ku]]\n|\u71b1\u7530\u533a\n|Blue\n|66,318\n|8.20\n|8,088\n| rowspan=\"16\" |[[File:Nagoya_Wards.png|center|border|400px|A map of Nagoya's Wards]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2\n|[[Chikusa-ku, Nagoya|Chikusa-ku]]\n| \u5343\u7a2e\u533a\n|Brown\n|165,863\n|18.18\n|9,123\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3\n|[[Higashi-ku, Nagoya|Higashi-ku]]\n| \u6771\u533a\n|Red\n|82,939\n|7.71\n|10,757\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 4\n|[[Kita-ku, Nagoya|Kita-ku]]\n| \u5317\u533a\n|Purple\n|163,555\n|17.53\n|9,330\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 5\n|[[Meit\u014d-ku, Nagoya|Meit\u014d-ku]]\n| \u540d\u6771\u533a\n|Dark blue\n|165,287\n|19.45\n|8,498\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 6\n|[[Midori-ku, Nagoya|Midori-ku]]\n| \u7dd1\u533a\n|Light red\n|247,475\n|37.91\n|6,528\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 7\n|[[Minami-ku, Nagoya|Minami-ku]]\n| \u5357\u533a\n|Orange\n|136,015\n|18.46\n|7,368\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 8\n|[[Minato-ku, Nagoya|Minato-ku]]\n| \u6e2f\u533a\n|Intense Green\n|143,913\n|45.64\n|3,153\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9\n|[[Mizuho-ku, Nagoya|Mizuho-ku]]\n|\u745e\u7a42\u533a\n|Dark purple\n|107,622\n|11.22\n|9,592\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 10\n|[[Moriyama-ku, Nagoya|Moriyama-ku]]\n|\u5b88\u5c71\u533a\n|Light green\n|176,298\n|34.01\n|5,184\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 11\n|[[Naka-ku, Nagoya|Naka-ku]] - administrative center\n|\u4e2d\u533a\n|Green\n|90,918\n|9.38\n|9,693\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 12\n|[[Nakagawa-ku, Nagoya|Nakagawa-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u5ddd\u533a\n|Pink\n|220,782\n|32.02\n|6,895\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 13\n|[[Nakamura-ku, Nagoya|Nakamura-ku]]\n|\u4e2d\u6751\u533a\n|Light blue\n|135,134\n|16.30\n|8,290\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 14\n|[[Nishi-ku, Nagoya|Nishi-ku]]\n|\u897f\u533a\n|Dark orange\n|150,480\n|17.93\n|8,393\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 15\n|[[Sh\u014dwa-ku, Nagoya|Sh\u014dwa-ku]]\n|\u662d\u548c\u533a\n|Yellow\n|110,436\n|10.94\n|10,095\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 16\n|[[Tenpaku-ku]]\n|\u5929\u767d\u533a\n|Cyan\n|164,522\n|21.58\n|7,624\n|}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align: center;\" caption=\"Gallery\" heights=\"130px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Meieki_from_Heiwa_Park_Aqua_Tower.jpg|Nagoya City skyline seen from Heiwa Koen Aqua Tower\nFile:Nagoya_(2015-11-03).JPG|Nagoya in 2015\nFile:Nagoya 2017 (34159008173).jpg|Nagoya city night view\nFile:2016 Japan Nagoya 81 (33038233234).jpg|[[Sakae, Nagoya|Downtown of Sakae Town]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Climate ===\nNagoya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') with hot summers and cool winters.

Before and during the [[Edo period]] there were two main kilns in the region: [[Seto ware|Seto]] and [[Tokoname ware|Tokoname]]. In Nagoya Castle a type of ''oniwa-yaki'' (literally \"garden ware\") called [[Ofukei ware]] was produced by the feudal lord's court. Almost every feudal lord had his own ''oniwa-yaki'', also to have gifts made. In the town itself [[Toyoraku ware]] and [[Sasashima ware]] [[Japanese tea utensils]] were made with refined tastes. Ofukei ware started under the first Owari lord [[Tokugawa Yoshinao]] and was interrupted once, but continued on until the end of the [[Edo period]]. It became widely known in Japan. The lord's taste in ceramics was also imitated by other Owari samurai, such as [[Hirasawa Kur\u014d]] and [[Masaki S\u014dzabur\u014d]], who made their own pieces.\n\nToyoraku ware continued on until the [[Taish\u014d era]] under the 8th generation. Colourful pieces and gorgeous tea utensils were highly valued. Sasashima ware also experienced its heyday during this time. Colourful and soft ceramic items such as sake and tea utensils and objects were produced and intently collected.\n\nAn early type of manufactured production was the blue-and-white [[Kawana ware]]. With the advent of industrialisation during the [[Meiji era]] of the late 19th century, some export wares were produced. Industrial-scale export porcelain was made by old [[Noritake]], also ''Nagoya E-tsuke'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u7d75\u4ed8}}) became popular.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112214810/http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/archives/21092 |archive-date=2018-01-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nProduction of industrial ceramics continues to be an important economic factor with companies such as [[INAX]], [[NGK]], and [[NGK Insulators]].\n\n=== Technology ===\nMechanized puppets, called \"[[karakuri ningy\u014d]]\", are a traditional craft from the area.

They encouraged trade and the arts under their patronage, especially [[Tokugawa Muneharu]], the 7th lord, who took a keen interest in drama and plays and lived lavishly. Under his rule, actors and actresses began to visit Nagoya. Arts and culture was further supported by the city's wealthy merchants. Culture flourished after the feudal [[Edo period]] and the beginning of the Meiji era. During World War II many old buildings and artefacts were destroyed. The region's economic and financial power in the post-war years rekindled the artistic and cultural scene.\n\n=== Museums ===\nNagoya has multiple museums, including traditional and modern art, handicrafts to industrial high-tech, natural and scientific museums.\n\nNagoya Castle's collection is from the Owari Tokugawa era. The main tower is a museum that details the history of the castle and the city. The Honmaru Palace, destroyed in World War II, is slated for reconstruction by 2016 and will again be a prime example of the ''[[Shoin-zukuri]]'' architecture of the feudal era. [[Tokugawa Art Museum]] is a private museum belonging to the Owari Tokugawa, who lived in Nagoya castle for 16 generations.  Among other things, it contains 10 designated [[national Treasures of Japan]], including some of the oldest scrolls of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yamasa.org's Tokugawa Art Museum page |url=http://www.yamasa.org/japan/english/destinations/aichi/tokugawa_artmuseum.html}}</ref> The Nagoya Noh Theatre houses various precious objects of [[Noh theatre]]. The [[Nagoya City Museum]] showcases the history of the town.\n\n[[Y\u014dki-s\u014d]] is a villa and gardens located in Chikusa-ku, close to Nittai-ji. It was constructed in the Taish\u014d era for Ito Jirozaemon Suketami XV, the first president of [[Matsuzakaya]].\n\nPaintings and sculpture are exhibited at the [[Nagoya City Art Museum]]. Modern art is displayed at the [[Aichi Arts Center]]. The Aichi Arts Center also is the venue of rotating exhibitions. The city is also home to the [[Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], a sister museum to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], which was founded to bring aspects of the MFA's collection to Japan.\n\nThe art of [[porcelain]] and ceramics can be seen at the [[Noritake Garden]]. Toyota has two museums in the city, the [[Toyota Automobile Museum]] which shows vintage cars, and the [[Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology]], which showcases company history, including its start as a [[textile mill]].\n\nThe [[Nagoya City Tram & Subway Museum]] has trams and subway cars, as well as the [[Nagoya City Science Museum]]. The [[SCMaglev and Railway Park]] opened in March 2011 with various trains from the Central Japan Railway Company.\n\nOther art museums in Aichi prefecture are the [[Aichi Prefectural Ceramic Museum]] and the [[Toyota Municipal Museum of Art]]. [[Meiji Mura]] is an open-air museum with salvaged buildings from the Meiji, Taish\u014d and Showa eras. Another museum in Nagoya is the [[Mandolin Melodies Museum]].\n\nOther museums in the city include the [[International Design Centre Nagoya]], the [[Japan Spinning Top Museum]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Money Museum]].\n\nThe civic authorities promote tourism and have taken steps to safeguard architectural heritage by earmarking them as cultural assets. Apart from the castle, temples, shrines and museums in the city, a \"[[Cultural Path]]\" was instituted in the 1980s, located between the Tokugawa Art Museum and Nagoya Castle. This residential area has historic buildings such as the Nagoya City Archives, the Nagoya City Hall main building, the Aichi Prefectural Office main building, the Futaba Museum, the former residence of Sasuke Toyoda, the former residence of Tetsujiro Haruta and the Chikaramachi Catholic Church. Most buildings date from the Meiji and Taish\u014d era and are protected.\n\n=== Theatres ===\n[[Noh]] theatre and [[Ky\u014dgen]] date back to the feudal times of the Owari Tokugawa. The [[Nagoya Noh Theater]] at Nagoya Castle continues that tradition and is a prominent feature in the cultural life of the city, with monthly performances.\n\nDeveloped during the Edo period, one of Japan's ''[[kabuki]]'' grand stages is [[Misono-za]], which also hosts various other Japanese entertainment such as concerts.\n\nIn 1912 the musician Gor\u014d Morita invented the [[Nagoya harp]] music instrument.\n\nIn 1992, the large, modern [[Aichi Arts Center]] was opened in Sakae. It is the main venue for [[performing art]]s, featuring a main hall that can be used for [[opera]] and theatre and a concert hall. The [[Nagoya Philharmonic Orchestra]] performs there, as well as many visiting guest orchestras.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nApart from the main national [[Japanese festivals|festivals]] and holidays, other [[festivals in Nagoya]] are unique to the city/region.\n\nMajor events include the June Atsuta Festival, the July Port Festival, the August Nagoya Castle Summer Festival Castle and the October Nagoya Festival. Wards and areas host local festivals such as the {{Nihongo|''Daid\u014d-ch\u014dnin Matsuri''|\u5927\u9808\u5927\u9053\u753a\u4eba\u796d|Street Performer's Festival}} in \u014csu.\n\n=== Dialect ===\nThe {{nihongo|[[Nagoya dialect]]|\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5f01|Nagoya-ben}} is spoken in the western half of Aichi Prefecture, centering on Nagoya. It is also called {{Nihongo|Owari dialect|\u5c3e\u5f35\u5f01|Owari-ben}}. The Nagoya dialect is relatively close to [[Japanese language#Official status|standard Japanese]] and to the [[Kansai dialect]], differing in pronunciation and vocabulary.\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nThe industry of [[Japanese handicrafts]] in the city is centuries old.\n* Arimatsu and Narumi dye: during the construction of Nagoya Castle in the 17th century, the lords of Owari called in skilled craftsmen from [[Bungo Province]] in [[Kyushu]], known for their tie-dyed fabrics. These craftsmen and their families were treated generously by the Owari and settled in the Arimatsu und Narumi neighbourhoods. Only the base fabric is dyed, leaving parts that were knotted as white spots. This highly specialised process requires 6\u201312 months to complete.\n* ''[[Geta (footwear)|Geta]]'' [[Clog (shoe)|clog]] straps: wooden clogs called ''geta'' were the shoes of the feudal era. The Owari devised a unique pattern for the cotton straps of the clogs and ordered them to be made by local weavers. The technique has developed over the generations. The straps became stronger and more resilient but more comfortable for the feet with the discovery of cotton velvet.\n* ''Shippo'': the technique for [[enamelware]] called ''shippo'' arrived from the Netherlands towards the end of the Edo period. The patterns appear almost transparent and are often used on pottery.\n* Candles: [[wax]] is taken from a [[wax tree]] and painted around a rope made of grass and Japanese paper (''[[washi]]'') over and over again into layers. When cut in half, the candle looks as if it grew like a tree with rings. Japanese candles produce less smoke and are harder to blow out, since the [[Candle wick|wick]] tends to be larger. Artists paint the candles in coloured patterns.\n* ''Yuzen'': the art of [[silk]] dyeing was introduced by craftsmen from Kyoto during the rule of Owari Togukawa. The initial designs were extravagant and brightly coloured, but over time became more muted and light-coloured.\n* ''Sekku Ningyo'': festival dolls were introduced by markets during the Meiji era. Nagoya craftsmen rank among the top producers.\n* The city also gave its name to a type of ''[[obi (sash)|obi]]'', the sash that is used to tie a ''[[kimono]]''. The term ''Nagoya obi'' can refer to an older type of ''obi'' used centuries ago. This type was cord-like.<ref name=\"yoshino\">{{cite web |url=http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |title=Kimono |author=Yoshino Antiques |accessdate=2009-03-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326233826/http://www.yoshinoantiques.com/kimono.html |archivedate=2009-03-26 }}</ref> The current {{Nihongo3||\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|Nagoya obi}} \u2013 or to differentiate from the ''fukuro Nagoya obi'', also called {{Nihongo3||\u4e5d\u5bf8\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b\u5e2f?|ky\u016bsun Nagoya obi|extra=\"nine-inch nagoya obi\"}} \u2013 is the most-used ''obi'' type today.
