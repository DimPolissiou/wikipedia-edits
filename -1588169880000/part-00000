It is based on the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros'' series]].<ref name=about>{{cite web|last=McLeod|first=Gregory|title=McLeodGaming :: About|url=http://www.mcleodgaming.com/about.php|publisher=McLeodGaming|access-date=5 November 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020174406/http://www.mcleodgaming.com/about.php|archive-date=20 October 2012|df=}}</ref> The original ''Super Smash Flash'' is based specifically on ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]''. Its follow-up, also considered a reboot, is ''Super Smash Flash 2''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Super_Smash_Flash_2_Screenshot.png|left|frame|Screenshot of ''Super Smash Flash 2'', showing [[Mario]], [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], [[Lloyd Irving]] and [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] fighting on the Battlefield stage.]]\nLike in the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles, the player's objective is to knock opponents off of the screen. Players are given a percentage counter instead of a health bar, which increases as they take damage. A higher damage percentage means that attacks will send the player farther, which may ultimately lead to a KO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battling {{!}} Smash Flash DOJO!!!|url=http://ssfdojo.mcleodgaming.com/game-modes/battling/|work=Smash Flash DOJO!!!|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe games are not direct clones of the official titles, as they feature adjusted mechanics and playable content, both stages and characters, not present in the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' series by virtue of being a fanmade project.\n\nIn the original ''Super Smash Flash'', characters only have a total of five attacks each, activated by pressing the \"P\" key along with an arrow key, additionally, some characters had an extra attack while jumping. The reboot, ''Super Smash Flash 2'', offers control much more similar to that of the official games. Along with the option to use a keyboard like its predecessor, ''2'' adds support for [[USB]] [[Game controllers]] and other gaming devices that can be used for computers.\n\nAs with the official ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games, both ''Super Smash Flash'' and ''Super Smash Flash 2'' include several single-player modes, such as campaigns to defeat a series of computer-controlled opponents, events that have specific goals to clear, mini-games to test the player, etc. Players are awarded with numerous rewards and other collectibles by clearing single-player modes.\n\nThe original game features three single-player modes. In Regular Match, players can choose between Classic and Adventure Modes; once the whole roster has been unlocked, All-Star Mode becomes available. In Stadium, several mini-games and challenges are pitched to the player such as destroying eight targets using each characters's own abilities in Target Test or defeating grey-shaded versions of the playable roster in Multi-Man Melee. In Training Mode, players can tune up their playing skills by setting several parameters of their own.\n\nThe reboot expands the single-player experience. Classic Mode, for instance, has a greater variety of opponents. For Stadium, Target Test has been renamed Target Smash and features two modes: the first is a general system that features several levels and difficulties with a set pattern for targets on each level, the second one is more similar to the original's system, in which each character has a specifically-designed, individual level that tests the character's own abilities to destroy the targets.<ref name=\"SSF2Beta\">{{cite web|title=YouTube - McLeodGaming Direct - Super Smash Flash 2 Beta (1/25/15)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y4cX0jUxgI|website=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-Man Melee is now called Multi-Man Smash and the player now confronts black-palette versions of [[Mario]], [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] and [[Pikachu]], all whom have very limited movesets and high stamina. A missing Stadium sub-mode from the official games that is absent from the original ''SSF'' gets reincorporated: Home-Run Contest, where the objective is to launch as far as possible the Sandbag by previously racking up its damage, players are able to enable a disable a protective barrier that prevents the sandbag of getting out of the main platform, unless launched strong enough to break it. A new original Stadium sub-mode to be incorporated is Crystal Smash, where the objective is to destroy a multitude of crystals as quickly as possible. An Event Mode is also implemented, where players have to complete specific missions or defeat certain characters to accomplish the event; there is a total of 57 events to complete in the game.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nBoth ''Super Smash Flash'' and ''Super Smash Flash 2'' feature standard multiplayer battles, both against other players on the same machine and against computer-controlled characters with configurable difficulty levels.\n\nThe original game was very limited by its software Flash capacity; aside only one multiplayer mode (crowned as ''Melee'' mode), matches were limited for only two human players per match; the other remaining two slots could be filled with CPU entries only. The camera was only able to follow player one, leaving player two at a noticeable disadvantage.\n\n''SSF2'' expanded the multiplayer mode by introducing four player-entries controlled by human players and a dynamic camera system. Version 0.9b introduced Special Smash, a mode similar to the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles in which certain \"game modifiers\" like Mini (shrinks all characters), Slow (lowers the game speed), Turbo (which enables any attack to be cancelled on hit, directly taken with permission from fellow fan game [[Project M (video game)|''Project M'']]), or ''Super Smash Flash'' (which recreates the quirky and glitchy engine of the original game like attacks hitting once per frame, applying no hitlag, characters become unable to hold onto ledges, etc.) can be applied to matches.<ref name=kotaku>{{cite web|last1=Neltz|first1=Andr\u00e1s|title=The Smash Bros. Where You Can Play As Sora, Naruto, Ichigo, or Goku|url=http://kotaku.com/the-smash-bros-where-you-can-play-as-sora-goku-or-na-1609457769|website=Kotaku|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The Beta version introduced an original mode called Arena Mode, which enabled players to participate in some mini-games playing with the existing physics and characters in unorthodox-for-the-series ways using the Sandbag, much like Stadium on the single-player mode. There are currently two sub-modes known. The first is called Sandbag Soccer, in which players are pitched in an enclosed stage sorted to two teams, red and blue, and have to get the Sandbag into the opposing team's goal. The first team that reaches the number of goals set prior to the match wins. The other is called Sandbag Basketball and features a similar premise to the latter, except players now have to get the Sandbag to pass through the opposing team's hoop to score.<ref name=\" SSF2Beta\"/>\n\nEver since demo version 0.9b of ''SSF2'', players can fight against opponents online through a proprietary system dubbed the \"McLeodGaming Network\".<ref name=kotaku /><ref>{{cite web|title=McLeodGaming Network|url=http://mgn.mcleodgaming.com/|website=McLeodGaming Network|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Connections use the proprietary Adobe [[RTMFP]] technology unless the \"high latency\" setting is chosen, which hands the players off to a server rather than using a P2P connection.\n\n=== Playable characters ===\nThe original ''Super Smash Flash'' features 30 characters. These characters represent a wide variety of media, spanning not only video games but also manga, animated film, and fan-made creations. Like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, a number of these characters must be \"unlocked\" through various means.\n\n''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'' currently features 46 playable characters. As the game is still in development, this number is still subject to change. Fan-made newcomers from the previous game will not reappear due to the developers wanting to give a more professional tone to the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! width=175| Fighter\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:75px;\"| ''Flash''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:75px;\"| ''Flash 2''\n! width=175| [[List of video game franchises|Franchise]] <!-- Use series indicated in the games; do not speculate -->\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[List of Kirby characters#Bandana Waddle Dee|Bandana Dee]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Black Mage\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Final Fantasy]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Blade\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Na}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|''McLeodGaming''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Blue\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Na}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Bomberman]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Bomberman]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Super Mario]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Captain Falcon]]\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[F-Zero]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Chibi-Robo]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Chibi-Robo!

Originally, the game was a combat-oriented platform game with a ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' fan-characters called \"Blade\" and \"Blue\" (whom would remain a playable character even in the final product) and the focus was to get through a large level with suspended platforms taking out flying robotic bees called Buzzers (enemies from the [[Sega Genesis]] game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'').{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The game was eventually reworked into a ''Super Smash Bros.'' fan game\u2014then early called a \"flash Smash engine\" by Cleod9\u2014where small updates began incorporating new content, be new playable characters, stages or items<ref name=about /> It was based on ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' as that was the current title in the official series at the time. As Cleod9's first big flash project, the game was considered \"a great success for its time\".<ref>{{cite web|title=McLeodGaming \u2013 View Topic \u2013 SSF2 General Discussion [v0.9]|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=1171848#p1171848|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> The game was completed within roughly half a year's time without any outside coding assistance, and was released August 21, 2006 on ''Newgrounds'', a website known for its user-made Flash content.<ref>{{cite web|title =Game Projects <nowiki>|</nowiki> Greg McLeod|url = http://www.greg-mcleod.com/index.php/game/|publisher = McLeod, Gregory|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> It is currently the 15th most played game ever on [[Newgrounds]].\n\n=== ''Super Smash Flash 2'' ===\nThe success of ''Super Smash Flash'' soon led to high demand for a sequel. When McLeodGaming first started development on ''Super Smash Flash 2'' in 2007, the game was planned to be a sequel to the original ''Super Smash Flash'', with the incremental aesthetic and gameplay improvements. This plan was ultimately discarded in favor of making a fresh, new start to reboot the series. Despite the title, ''Super Smash Flash 2'' is not actually a sequel; it is an entirely new game, and only retains the original name of the project because of how widely known the title has become throughout the fanbase. Although the game is not complete yet, pre-releases \u2013 also known as [[Game demo|demos]] of the game \u2013 have been posted to their website for users and fans to see how far in development the game is. Various attempts to post minor updates to the game have also been posted to the \"''Smash Flash DOJO''\", one of several websites run by developers based on a similar [[Nintendo]]-run site for the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Smash Bros.'']] series, but each attempt has been abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the ''Smash Flash DOJO!!!''|url=http://ssfdojo.mcleodgaming.com/notices/notice-1|website=Smash Flash DOJO!!!|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> Updates are also occasionally posted on the team's [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages.\n\nThere were two major turning points in the game's development. The first was on January 1, 2009, on the release of v0.4a. This was the point where the game began to sharply grow considerably more complex, leading to snags in development as the difficulty of adding new characters was stated by Cleod to have \"increased exponentially\" at this point.<ref>{{cite web|title=January 1, 2008 News (Happy New Year + v0.4a Released)|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=263180#p263180|website=McLeodGaming (1 January 2009)|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The second turning point came with the following release, v0.7, on January 1, 2011. Initially thought to merely be an update that added content, [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Black Mage|Black Mage]] was included as a [[Player character#hidden character|hidden character]] after playing ten battles. This was a shock to the fanbase, as he was the first character to be introduced who was not in the originally planned character roster. Directly related to knowledge of his surprise inclusion spreading among the general fanbase, McLeodGaming soon made an announcement that the oft-criticized planned roster had undergone a complete overhaul.<ref>{{cite web|title=January 6th, 2011 News (v0.7 Update + Important Roster Info)|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=904623#p904623|website=McLeodGaming (6 February 2011)|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe final demo, ''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'', was announced on January 25, 2015. It was notable for dropping both the [[version number]] and designating itself as a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] rather than a [[Shareware|demo]]. On May 29, 2017, ''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'' was finally released after three years of development, it added various aspects to stand on its own as a game, both present in the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles, such as Classic Mode (primarily in the vein of the original [[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|''Super Smash Bros.'']], but with added elements), and original to the game, such as Arena Mode.\n\n== Reception ==\n''Super Smash Flash'' garnered a mixed to positive critical reception. Though initially reviewed positively, later reviews such as one on FlashGN found the game to be \"lacking control\", and \"simply a buggy and flawed attempt at recreating one of the best fighting games of all time.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Shawn|title=FGN- 'Super Smash Flash Review'|url=http://flashgn.com/review/2|publisher=Afro Ninja Productions|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref> Despite some poor reviews, Super Smash Flash earned a [[Newgrounds]] daily feature award, over 11 million views, and a four star rating, and later was categorized as making \"Flash Portal History\" for 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/flashportalhistory2006 |title=Flash Portal History: 2006 |publisher=[[Newgrounds]], Inc |access-date=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306045924/http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/flashportalhistory2006 |archive-date=6 March 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>  The game has picked up several other minor awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Smash Flash EXE Software Informer: Awards|url=http://super-smash-flash-exe.software.informer.com/awards/|publisher=[[Informer Technologies, Inc.]]|accessdate=5 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n''Super Smash Flash 2'', though currently incomplete, has gained significantly more traction than its predecessor.

Its follow-up, also considered a reboot, is ''Super Smash Flash 2''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Super_Smash_Flash_2_Screenshot.png|left|frame|Screenshot of ''Super Smash Flash 2'', showing [[Mario]], [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], [[Lloyd Irving]] and [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] fighting on the Battlefield stage.]]\nLike in the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles, the player's objective is to knock opponents off of the screen. Players are given a percentage counter instead of a health bar, which increases as they take damage. A higher damage percentage means that attacks will send the player farther, which may ultimately lead to a KO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Battling {{!}} Smash Flash DOJO!!!|url=http://ssfdojo.mcleodgaming.com/game-modes/battling/|work=Smash Flash DOJO!!!|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe games are not direct clones of the official titles, as they feature adjusted mechanics and playable content, both stages and characters, not present in the original ''Super Smash Bros.'' series by virtue of being a fanmade project.\n\nIn the original ''Super Smash Flash'', characters only have a total of five attacks each, activated by pressing the \"P\" key along with an arrow key, additionally, some characters had an extra attack while jumping. The reboot, ''Super Smash Flash 2'', offers control much more similar to that of the official games. Along with the option to use a keyboard like its predecessor, ''2'' adds support for [[USB]] [[Game controllers]] and other gaming devices that can be used for computers.\n\nAs with the official ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' games, both ''Super Smash Flash'' and ''Super Smash Flash 2'' include several single-player modes, such as campaigns to defeat a series of computer-controlled opponents, events that have specific goals to clear, mini-games to test the player, etc. Players are awarded with numerous rewards and other collectibles by clearing single-player modes.\n\nThe original game features three single-player modes. In Regular Match, players can choose between Classic and Adventure Modes; once the whole roster has been unlocked, All-Star Mode becomes available. In Stadium, several mini-games and challenges are pitched to the player such as destroying eight targets using each characters's own abilities in Target Test or defeating grey-shaded versions of the playable roster in Multi-Man Melee. In Training Mode, players can tune up their playing skills by setting several parameters of their own.\n\nThe reboot expands the single-player experience. Classic Mode, for instance, has a greater variety of opponents. For Stadium, Target Test has been renamed Target Smash and features two modes: the first is a general system that features several levels and difficulties with a set pattern for targets on each level, the second one is more similar to the original's system, in which each character has a specifically-designed, individual level that tests the character's own abilities to destroy the targets.<ref name=\"SSF2Beta\">{{cite web|title=YouTube - McLeodGaming Direct - Super Smash Flash 2 Beta (1/25/15)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y4cX0jUxgI|website=YouTube|publisher=Google, Inc.|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-Man Melee is now called Multi-Man Smash and the player now confronts black-palette versions of [[Mario]], [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]], [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] and [[Pikachu]], all whom have very limited movesets and high stamina. A missing Stadium sub-mode from the official games that is absent from the original ''SSF'' gets reincorporated: Home-Run Contest, where the objective is to launch as far as possible the Sandbag by previously racking up its damage, players are able to enable a disable a protective barrier that prevents the sandbag of getting out of the main platform, unless launched strong enough to break it. A new original Stadium sub-mode to be incorporated is Crystal Smash, where the objective is to destroy a multitude of crystals as quickly as possible. An Event Mode is also implemented, where players have to complete specific missions or defeat certain characters to accomplish the event; there is a total of 57 events to complete in the game.\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nBoth ''Super Smash Flash'' and ''Super Smash Flash 2'' feature standard multiplayer battles, both against other players on the same machine and against computer-controlled characters with configurable difficulty levels.\n\nThe original game was very limited by its software Flash capacity; aside only one multiplayer mode (crowned as ''Melee'' mode), matches were limited for only two human players per match; the other remaining two slots could be filled with CPU entries only. The camera was only able to follow player one, leaving player two at a noticeable disadvantage.\n\n''SSF2'' expanded the multiplayer mode by introducing four player-entries controlled by human players and a dynamic camera system. Version 0.9b introduced Special Smash, a mode similar to the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles in which certain \"game modifiers\" like Mini (shrinks all characters), Slow (lowers the game speed), Turbo (which enables any attack to be cancelled on hit, directly taken with permission from fellow fan game [[Project M (video game)|''Project M'']]), or ''Super Smash Flash'' (which recreates the quirky and glitchy engine of the original game like attacks hitting once per frame, applying no hitlag, characters become unable to hold onto ledges, etc.) can be applied to matches.<ref name=kotaku>{{cite web|last1=Neltz|first1=Andr\u00e1s|title=The Smash Bros. Where You Can Play As Sora, Naruto, Ichigo, or Goku|url=http://kotaku.com/the-smash-bros-where-you-can-play-as-sora-goku-or-na-1609457769|website=Kotaku|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The Beta version introduced an original mode called Arena Mode, which enabled players to participate in some mini-games playing with the existing physics and characters in unorthodox-for-the-series ways using the Sandbag, much like Stadium on the single-player mode. There are currently two sub-modes known. The first is called Sandbag Soccer, in which players are pitched in an enclosed stage sorted to two teams, red and blue, and have to get the Sandbag into the opposing team's goal. The first team that reaches the number of goals set prior to the match wins. The other is called Sandbag Basketball and features a similar premise to the latter, except players now have to get the Sandbag to pass through the opposing team's hoop to score.<ref name=\" SSF2Beta\"/>\n\nEver since demo version 0.9b of ''SSF2'', players can fight against opponents online through a proprietary system dubbed the \"McLeodGaming Network\".<ref name=kotaku /><ref>{{cite web|title=McLeodGaming Network|url=http://mgn.mcleodgaming.com/|website=McLeodGaming Network|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Connections use the proprietary Adobe [[RTMFP]] technology unless the \"high latency\" setting is chosen, which hands the players off to a server rather than using a P2P connection.\n\n=== Playable characters ===\nThe original ''Super Smash Flash'' features 30 characters. These characters represent a wide variety of media, spanning not only video games but also manga, animated film, and fan-made creations. Like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, a number of these characters must be \"unlocked\" through various means.\n\n''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'' currently features 46 playable characters. As the game is still in development, this number is still subject to change. Fan-made newcomers from the previous game will not reappear due to the developers wanting to give a more professional tone to the game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n! width=175| Fighter\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:75px;\"| ''Flash''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:75px;\"| ''Flash 2''\n! width=175| [[List of video game franchises|Franchise]] <!-- Use series indicated in the games; do not speculate -->\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[List of Kirby characters#Bandana Waddle Dee|Bandana Dee]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Black Mage\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Final Fantasy]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Blade\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Na}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"|''McLeodGaming''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| Blue\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Na}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Bomberman]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Bomberman]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Super Mario]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Captain Falcon]]\n| {{Ya}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[F-Zero]]''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! scope=\"row\"| [[Chibi-Robo]]\n| {{Na}}\n| {{Ya}}\n| ''[[Chibi-Robo!

Originally, the game was a combat-oriented platform game with a ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' fan-characters called \"Blade\" and \"Blue\" (whom would remain a playable character even in the final product) and the focus was to get through a large level with suspended platforms taking out flying robotic bees called Buzzers (enemies from the [[Sega Genesis]] game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'').{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} The game was eventually reworked into a ''Super Smash Bros.'' fan game\u2014then early called a \"flash Smash engine\" by Cleod9\u2014where small updates began incorporating new content, be new playable characters, stages or items<ref name=about /> It was based on ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' as that was the current title in the official series at the time. As Cleod9's first big flash project, the game was considered \"a great success for its time\".<ref>{{cite web|title=McLeodGaming \u2013 View Topic \u2013 SSF2 General Discussion [v0.9]|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=1171848#p1171848|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> The game was completed within roughly half a year's time without any outside coding assistance, and was released August 21, 2006 on ''Newgrounds'', a website known for its user-made Flash content.<ref>{{cite web|title =Game Projects <nowiki>|</nowiki> Greg McLeod|url = http://www.greg-mcleod.com/index.php/game/|publisher = McLeod, Gregory|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> It is currently the 15th most played game ever on [[Newgrounds]].\n\n=== ''Super Smash Flash 2'' ===\nThe success of ''Super Smash Flash'' soon led to high demand for a sequel. When McLeodGaming first started development on ''Super Smash Flash 2'' in 2007, the game was planned to be a sequel to the original ''Super Smash Flash'', with the incremental aesthetic and gameplay improvements. This plan was ultimately discarded in favor of making a fresh, new start to reboot the series. Despite the title, ''Super Smash Flash 2'' is not actually a sequel; it is an entirely new game, and only retains the original name of the project because of how widely known the title has become throughout the fanbase. Although the game is not complete yet, pre-releases \u2013 also known as [[Game demo|demos]] of the game \u2013 have been posted to their website for users and fans to see how far in development the game is. Various attempts to post minor updates to the game have also been posted to the \"''Smash Flash DOJO''\", one of several websites run by developers based on a similar [[Nintendo]]-run site for the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Smash Bros.'']] series, but each attempt has been abandoned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to the ''Smash Flash DOJO!!!''|url=http://ssfdojo.mcleodgaming.com/notices/notice-1|website=Smash Flash DOJO!!!|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref> Updates are also occasionally posted on the team's [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] pages.\n\nThere were two major turning points in the game's development. The first was on January 1, 2009, on the release of v0.4a. This was the point where the game began to sharply grow considerably more complex, leading to snags in development as the difficulty of adding new characters was stated by Cleod to have \"increased exponentially\" at this point.<ref>{{cite web|title=January 1, 2008 News (Happy New Year + v0.4a Released)|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=263180#p263180|website=McLeodGaming (1 January 2009)|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> The second turning point came with the following release, v0.7, on January 1, 2011. Initially thought to merely be an update that added content, [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Black Mage|Black Mage]] was included as a [[Player character#hidden character|hidden character]] after playing ten battles. This was a shock to the fanbase, as he was the first character to be introduced who was not in the originally planned character roster. Directly related to knowledge of his surprise inclusion spreading among the general fanbase, McLeodGaming soon made an announcement that the oft-criticized planned roster had undergone a complete overhaul.<ref>{{cite web|title=January 6th, 2011 News (v0.7 Update + Important Roster Info)|url=http://forums.mcleodgaming.com/viewtopic.php?p=904623#p904623|website=McLeodGaming (6 February 2011)|publisher=McLeodGaming|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe final demo, ''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'', was announced on January 25, 2015. It was notable for dropping both the [[version number]] and designating itself as a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] rather than a [[Shareware|demo]]. On May 29, 2017, ''Super Smash Flash 2 Beta'' was finally released after three years of development, it added various aspects to stand on its own as a game, both present in the official ''Super Smash Bros.'' titles, such as Classic Mode (primarily in the vein of the original [[Super Smash Bros. (video game)|''Super Smash Bros.'']], but with added elements), and original to the game, such as Arena Mode.\n\n== Reception ==\n''Super Smash Flash'' garnered a mixed to positive critical reception.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nBinmaley is located along the western coastland of Pangasinan facing the [[Lingayen Gulf]], in between Lingayen and Dagupan City.  On January 8\u20139, 1945, the amphibious forces of U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used the town's beach, designated as \"yellow beach\", alongside the beaches of [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Dagupan]], and San Fabian, in their landing operations to liberate Luzon from Japanese occupation during [[World War II]].\n\nThe town is famous for its ''bangus'' (milkfish) aqua-culture, due to the existence of its numerous fishponds (''pokok'' in the Pangasinan language).  However, because of constant siltation over the past several years from mine tailings upstream from [[Agno River]] (due to mine operations in neighboring [[Benguet]] Province), and the overuse of artificial fish feeds, the ''bangus'' industry has suffered from fishkill, fewer viable fishponds and lower harvests.  As a result, many formerly productive fishponds have been converted into large commercial and residential lots.  This phenomenon is beginning to seriously threaten the unique Binmaley fishpond industry.  Current Government action is inadequate due to strong pressures from other competing commercial interests, not to mention fishfeed producers.\n\nBinmaley's town center has a Neo classical church dating back to the 17th century.  It also became famous throughout the Philippines for the outstanding academic achievements of students (and its distinctive corps of military cadets) from its Binmaley Catholic High School, especially when it was headed by a German priest, Fr. Leo Behneke, in the 1960s and 1970s. Its name roughly means \"the place which became a town\" or \"went to town\" in the [[Pangasinan language]].\n\nBinmaley, is famously known for its \"Sigay Festival\". The [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] word ''sigay'' broadly translates to harvest, or a time to gather the rich yields of the farm, the sea, the ponds and the rivers. It also relates to a contraction of the words ''silew'', meaning light, and ''gayaga'', meaning merriment. It was Mayor Lorenzo \"Enzo\" Cerezo who pioneered and founded \"Sigay Festival\".\n\n==Barangays==\n\nBinmaley is politically subdivided into 33 [[barangay]]s.\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*

On January 8\u20139, 1945, the amphibious forces of U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] used the town's beach, designated as \"yellow beach\", alongside the beaches of [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Dagupan]], and San Fabian, in their landing operations to liberate Luzon from Japanese occupation during [[World War II]].\n\nThe town is famous for its ''bangus'' (milkfish) aqua-culture, due to the existence of its numerous fishponds (''pokok'' in the Pangasinan language).  However, because of constant siltation over the past several years from mine tailings upstream from [[Agno River]] (due to mine operations in neighboring [[Benguet]] Province), and the overuse of artificial fish feeds, the ''bangus'' industry has suffered from fishkill, fewer viable fishponds and lower harvests.  As a result, many formerly productive fishponds have been converted into large commercial and residential lots.  This phenomenon is beginning to seriously threaten the unique Binmaley fishpond industry.  Current Government action is inadequate due to strong pressures from other competing commercial interests, not to mention fishfeed producers.\n\nBinmaley's town center has a Neo classical church dating back to the 17th century.  It also became famous throughout the Philippines for the outstanding academic achievements of students (and its distinctive corps of military cadets) from its Binmaley Catholic High School, especially when it was headed by a German priest, Fr. Leo Behneke, in the 1960s and 1970s. Its name roughly means \"the place which became a town\" or \"went to town\" in the [[Pangasinan language]].\n\nBinmaley, is famously known for its \"Sigay Festival\". The [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan]] word ''sigay'' broadly translates to harvest, or a time to gather the rich yields of the farm, the sea, the ponds and the rivers. It also relates to a contraction of the words ''silew'', meaning light, and ''gayaga'', meaning merriment. It was Mayor Lorenzo \"Enzo\" Cerezo who pioneered and founded \"Sigay Festival\".\n\n==Barangays==\n\nBinmaley is politically subdivided into 33 [[barangay]]s.\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Amancoro\n* Balagan\n* Balogo\n* Basing\n* Baybay Lopez\n* Baybay Polong\n* Biec\n* Buenlag\n* Calit\n* Caloocan Dupo\n* Caloocan Norte\n* Caloocan Sur\n* Camaley\n* Canaoalan\n* Dulag\n* Gayaman\n* Linoc\n* Lomboy\n* Nagpalangan\n* Malindong\n* Manat\n* Naguilayan\n* Pallas\n* Papagueyan\n* Parayao\n* Poblacion\n* Pototan\n* Sabangan\n* Salapingao\n* San Isidro Norte\n* San Isidro Sur\n* Santa Rosa\n* Tombor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align=none\n| title= Population census of Binmaley\n| 1903 = 16439\n| 1918 = 18243\n| 1939 = 20455\n| 1948 = 26501\n| 1960 = 32127\n| 1970 = 40645\n| 1975 = 43543\n| 1980 = 47332\n| 1990 = 59601\n| 1995 = 62375\n| 2000 = 72625\n| 2007 = 76214\n| 2010 = 78702\n| 2015 = 83052\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|location = Binmaley, Pangasinan\n|width=auto\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 31\n| Feb high C = 31\n| Mar high C = 33\n| Apr high C = 34\n| May high C = 34\n| Jun high C = 33\n| Jul high C = 32\n| Aug high C = 31\n| Sep high C = 31\n| Oct high C = 32\n| Nov high C = 31\n| Dec high C = 31\n| Jan low C = 21\n| Feb low C = 21\n| Mar low C = 23\n| Apr low C = 25\n| May low C = 25\n| Jun low C = 25\n| Jul low C = 25\n| Aug low C = 24\n| Sep low C = 24\n| Oct low C = 24\n| Nov low C = 23\n| Dec low C = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 4.3 \n| Jan rain days = 3 \n| Feb precipitation mm = 19.1 \n| Feb rain days = 2\n| Mar precipitation mm = 27.3 \n| Mar rain days = 3 \n| Apr precipitation mm = 45.2 \n| Apr rain days = 5 \n| May precipitation mm = 153.3\n| May rain days = 14    \n| Jun precipitation mm = 271.3 \n| Jun rain days = 17 \n| Jul precipitation mm = 411.1\n| Jul rain days = 22  \n| Aug precipitation mm = 532 \n| Aug rain days = 23\n| Sep precipitation mm = 364.4 \n| Sep rain days = 21 \n| Oct precipitation mm = 182.5 \n| Oct rain days = 13\n| Nov precipitation mm = 56.3 \n| Nov rain days = 7\n| Dec precipitation mm = 24.4 \n| Dec rain days = 4\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Binmaley-weather-averages/Pangasinan/PH.aspx\n| title = Binmaley, Pangasinan: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 26 September 2015}}</ref>\n| date=September 2015}}\n\n==Heritage==\n{{main|List of Cultural Properties of the Philippines in Binmaley, Pangasinan}}\n\n==Images==\n<gallery perrow=3>\nFile:Binmaley56788jf.JPG|The Our Lady of the Purification Parish Church\nFile:Binmaley567yjf.JPG|Binmaley Museum\nFile:Binmaley567wjf.JPG|Binmaley Presidencia [http://www.pangasinan.org/binmaley/]\nFile:Binmaley567cjf.JPG|Bulwagan ng Sangguniang Bayan at Himpilan ng Pambansang Kapulisan\nFile:Binmaley567bjf.JPG|Pamilihang Bayan ng Binmaley\nFile:Binmaley567jf.JPG|Manat river & Gumapos Bridge\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105401/http://www.competitive.org.ph/cmcindex/pages/profile/?lgu=Binmaley Municipal Profile at the National Competitiveness Council of the Philippines]\n* [http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/binmaley/ Binmaley at Pangasinan Government Website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161010201809/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130624083039/https://www.pangasinan.org/binmaley/  Pangasinan.org : Binmaley Family and School Reunion Archives]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Binmaley\n | North     = ''[[Lingayen Gulf]]''\n | East      = [[Dagupan]]\n | Southeast = [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]]\n | South     = [[San Carlos, Pangasinan|San Carlos]]\n | West      = [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]]\n}}\n{{Pangasinan}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Pangasinan]]\n", "name_user": "Uzume", "label": "safe", "comment": "defaults to the current QID", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binmaley,_Pangasinan"}

{"title_page": "Nixon Family Assistance Plan (1969)", "text_new": "[[File:A three frame sequence of Richard M. Nixon giving a speech - NARA - 194695.tif|thumb|433x433px|President Nixon delivering a speech in 1969 around the time the Family Assistance Plan was introduced.]]The Family Assistance Program (FAP) was a welfare program introduced by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1969, which aimed to implement a [[negative income tax]] for households with working parents. The FAP was influenced by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B. Johnson's]] [[War on poverty|War on Poverty]] program that aimed to expand welfare across all American citizens, especially for [[Working class in the United States|working-class]] Americans. Nixon intended for the FAP to replace existing welfare programs such as the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Assist Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program as a way to attract conservative voters that were beginning to become wary of welfare while maintaining middle-class constituencies. The FAP specifically provided aid assistance to working-class Americans, dividing benefits based on age, the number of children, family income, and eligibility. Initially, the Nixon administration thought the FAP legislation would easily pass through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the more liberal [[United States Senate|Senate]], as both chambers were controlled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In June 1971, the FAP under the bill H.R. 1 during the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]], passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. However, from December 1971 to June 1972 H.R.1\u00a0 bill that included the FAP underwent scrutiny in the Senate chamber, particularly by the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] controlled by the [[conservative Democrat]]s, while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were also reluctant on passing the program. Eventually, on October 5 of 1972, a revised version of H.R.1 passed the Senate with a vote of 68-5 that only authorized\u00a0 funding for FAP testing before its implementation. Nevertheless, before Nixon signed the bill on October 15, 1972 the entire provision on FAP was dropped. The FAP enjoyed broad support from Americans across different regions. Reception towards the program varied across racial, regional, income, and gender differences. The FAP is best remembered for beginning the rhetoric against the expansion of welfare that was popular during the [[New Deal]]. It initiated the support for anti-welfare conservative movements that became mainstream in American political discourse during the [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== The Need for the Family Assistance Program - Controversy over the AFDC ===\nWhen President Nixon took office in 1968, issues pertaining to poverty and welfare in the United States had been at the forefront of many political discussions, largely stemming from prior [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson's]] proclaimed \"[[war on poverty]]\" in 1964. Welfare and social insurance had been a federal responsibility as early as the 1930s, when state-sponsored welfare was replaced with \"social security\" networks headed by the Federal government which included commonly considered aspects of welfare support such as unemployment benefits, workers compensation, and veterans' payments. The [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]] dictated welfare as a \"layered system\" in which five \"layers\" of income protection - ranging from private insurance, social insurance, and categorical assistance - acted to reduce the threats of poverty. Those that created the bill hoped that the act would create a dynamic that would not only reduce the amount of poverty in the nation, but in doing also reduce the need for social insurance as more and more citizens became able to support themselves free of welfare aid.<ref name=\":0\">Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp 1-5.</ref>\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, a program that had been created with the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]] to support families at risk, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]] (Aid to Assist Families with Dependant Children), had only continued to expand. From 1965\u20131970, the ADFC experienced an expansion of 110 percent, and its rapid growth\u00a0had become a heated topic of debate for both the Democratic and Republican party as welfare costs for the government increased.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the time Nixon came into presidency, the projected cost of the AFDC was 6 billion dollars annually, straining already tight state and federal budgets.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp 5.</ref> The rapid expansion of this program stemmed largely from the liberalization of its requirements through the 1950s and early 1960s, in which the eligible age for a child to be a dependant to 21, and the eligibility of families whose primary \u2018breadwinner\u2019 had been unemployed for long periods of time. At the time of Nixon's FAP speech in 1969, the primary beneficiaries of the AFDC were families who had undergone a breakup through divorce, desertion, or illegitimacy - which were decisively more common than families needing assistance for unavoidable hardships like the death of a father.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp. 3</ref>\n\nThe rising costs and liberalization of the AFDC not only caused congressional backlash but also brought with it racially charged and negative responses by states burdened with increasing numbers of AFDC recipients. Indications within congress and the public began to hint at a perception of rising welfare issues to be a largely minority or immigrant issue. Legislation was passed in Louisiana which declared children born out of wedlock or families cohabiting without an official marriage license to be inadmissible for AFDC benefits. Around 6,000 families were dropped, only 5% of whom were of Caucasian background. In 1961, aggravations revolving the AFDC came to a head in the small town of [[Newburgh, New York]] in what popularity became known as the \u2018Battle of Newburgh\u2019. Facing a sudden spike in welfare applicants due to tough economic conditions during the winter of 1961, City Manager [[Joseph Mitchell (city manager)|Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] placed the blame on this rise in welfare costs primarily on immigration into the city. Mitchell proposed changes to the AFDC which included a requirement of proof that the beneficiary was entering Newburgh with a work position, a change to aid divvied out by voucher rather than cash, and denial of aid to those not working or to new children conceived while the family was receiving welfare assistance.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Asen|first=Robert|date=2001-06-01|title=Nixon's Welfare Reform: Enacting Historical Contradictions of Poverty Discourses|journal=Rhetoric & Public Affairs|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=261\u2013279|doi=10.1353/rap.2001.0019|issn=1534-5238}}</ref>\n\nWhile Newburgh was only a small town of 30,000, the controversial proposals made by Mitchell received national attention, and polls conducted by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] showed that up to 74% of the population surveyed agreed with Mitchell that welfare should only be given to immigrants who came with a definite job opportunity and means of work. Further Gallup polls in 1964 found that over 50% of participants believed a 60-day residency should be required before an individual could be able to apply for AFDC welfare. Many also began to\u00a0 attribute the need for welfare as laziness, or a combination of misfortune and laziness. A common idea that began to spring up in discussions was the split between those \u2018deserving\u2019 or \u2018undeserving\u2019 or welfare. Highlighting this split was the notion that those \u2018undeserving\u2019 of welfare assistance were largely not working and instead coasting off of the benefits received. Some believed women were having children precisely to play the system and further the benefits they were receiving from AFDC.<ref name=\":1\" /> Indeed, this cultural divide between the deserving and undeserving would continue to underscore public opinion on welfare not only as the AFDC was debated, but in later moments as well in discussions of Nixon's FAP.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steensland|first=Brian|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1185904/pdf|title=The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3748-9|location=|pages=28\u201352|language=English}}</ref>\n\nDespite public frustration and debates over adding restrictions to the AFDC to control costs, there was still a large number of the public which considered poverty aid to be a universal, basic right. A 1964 Harris poll found that 68% of participants believed the Federal government had a responsibility to ensure basic human rights and a minimum livable wage to its citizens, reaffirmed by 73% of participants in a later 1969 poll. Poverty and inequality had been raised as an issue by Johnson in 1964, and pressure was continuing to be placed on the Federal government to alleviate rising national poverty rates. Instances of riots and public disgruntlement plaguing the 1960s were connected to a welfare system not adequately supporting the needs of the population.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTo many in congress, it was clear that the answer was not to restrict the AFDC, but rather reform it. The AFDC was plagued with numerous inequalities not only among its recipients but between states. In 1968, 26 states did not pass the threshold for welfare support from the AFDC that allowed families to be above the \u2018poverty-line\u2019. Families in New Jersey could receive up to 332 dollars a month, whereas some families in Mississippi were receiving a comparatively meager 55 dollars a month. The AFDC also overwhelmingly denied access to assistance to families who had an employed head, even if their overall income still placed them below the poverty line. In 1966, this excluded around 12 million families from access to the AFDC. As such, there were fears that the AFDC created instances of dependency for those unable to work, as well as dis-incentivized families on welfare assistance to find work. In 1967, legislation pushed for a work-incentive phase (WIN) to AFDC, which required families currently on the program to participate in job/work training to continue receiving benefits.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heyman|first=Philip|title=The Family Assistance Plan: Abridged|publisher=Kennedy School of Government|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> By early January 1969, the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] had installed a committee to study the welfare system and propose changes, culminating in the eventual announcement of the FAP in August 1969. Nixon's plan envisioned a welfare system that ventured not only to fix [[welfare dependency]] and rising costs for government, but also aimed to combat rising inequality within the welfare system and afford income assistance as a basic, universal right.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Nixon's Political Motivations ===\nMotivations to reform welfare and introduce the FAP were not only grounded in moral terms of eradicating poverty in the United States. As documents were opened in the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library]] (RNPL), it has become clear that much of the reasoning behind Nixon's proposal of the FAP may have come from an attempt to appease the worries of a predominately white lower and middle working class. Nixon highlighted this as his \u2018Northern Strategy\u2019 - efforts to garner votes and support from blue-collar workers in industrialized states where the working class was predominantly white. Nixon viewed this group of people as his \u2018silent majority\u2019 - a ticket to winning popularity from a larger majority of Americans. Nixon therefore objectively took a moderate/centrist stance in his implementation of the FAP, noting that conservatives would likely find issue in welfare reform, especially if it blurred racial lines. In this context, the FAP was largely chosen as it redistributed welfare benefits to the working class poor, who were largely Caucasian in ethnicity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Spitzer|first=Scott J.|date=2012|title=Nixon's New Deal: Welfare Reform for the Silent Majority|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455\u2013481|doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2012.03989.x|issn=1741-5705}}</ref> Indeed, one estimate indicated that there would be a shift in the ethnicity of beneficiaries from 51.7% non-white in the 1969 AFDC program to 38.6% non-white in the FAP program by 1972.<ref>Bowler, M. Kenneth. ''The Nixon guaranteed income proposal: Substance and process in policy change''. Ballinger Publishing Company, 1974.</ref> By creating an entirely new system of welfare reform, Nixon was also separating himself from liberal policy makers like former president Johnson, gaining him an edge politically. The FAP also addressed both leftist qualms with the AFDC over inadequate welfare assistance and welfare inequality while also addressing criticisms of the AFDC from the right over welfare dependency and dis-incentives to work. By proposing the FAP, Nixon hoped he could not only garner praise from liberals seeking more egalitarian welfare reform but also appeal to a new kind of veiled, latent racial conservatism.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Specific Provisions of the Family Assistance Plan ==\n\n=== Initial Proposal ===\nThe initial proposal of guaranteed income by the Nixon administration would include all poor families \u2013 \"[[working poor]],\" \"[[Dependant|dependent]],\" and poor families headed by a male. The benefit level would not be reduced for families currently enrolled in the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]], for states were required to compensate for the difference between proposed minimum payment and the state's current benefit level. States would be receiving federal assistance, so none would be required to supplement the incomes of the working poor.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011).

Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 115-116</ref> The essential details of Nixon's initial plan included the following:\n\n1. \tOnly families with unmarried children under 18 years of age or 21 if still in school, are eligible for the benefit under the FAP.\n\n2. \tA family of 4 with no other income is eligible for a maximum of $1600\n\n* The same family of 4 sees no change in the amount of benefit up to the income of $720; and\n* Any other income beyond $720 would be taxed at the rate of 50% until the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even point]] or until a point where the benefit would fall to zero, $3920, except:\n**For the earnings from [[Veteran's pension (United States)|Veteran's pension]] and certain farm payments as these are taxed at 100%; \n**For children's earnings, welfare payments and other applicable payments as these are not taxable; and\n**For some [[Child care|child-care]] expenses which are also excluded from income calculation.\n\n3. \tFamilies in possession of resources amounting to over $1500 and a home, personal household goods and other resources or properties considered essential to family's self-support would be ineligible for the FAP benefits unless they dispose of excess possessions at a specified rate.\n\n4. \tFor the purposes of the FAP eligibility, a family is defined to only include family members who are related by blood, marriage or adoption except in the case of a stepfather who shall be considered to be a member of the family. The following category of people are excluded from a family unit:\n\n* Members not living in the same household, in-laws, grandparents, and 20-year-old adults not in school whose income information may be unavailable to the other family members;\n* Members of the Armed forces and their spouses and children;\n* Recipients of the aid to the aged, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently and totally disabled, and their dependents;\n* Although the income period is set to be one year, for the purposes of calculating the FAP benefits, the family's current quarterly income is taken into account.\n* Any over or underpayments are to be fixed upon detection.\n\n5. \tRefusal of taking on a \"suitable\" work or training \u2013 that is, registering with the state employment service- by [[able-bodied]] family members including single women may result in the reduction of the FAP benefits.\n\n* The women heads of family who are not in the [[Full-time job|full-time]] workforce and whose youngest child is over 6 years old.\n* Mothers whose youngest child is under 6 years old are exempt from meeting the work requirement.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969.

Under the newly revised plan, the exemption only applied to mothers if their dependent child is under 3 years old;<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011).

They were no longer required to supplement the payments above the established benefit level. The new plan would completely eliminate the welfare expenditures of twenty-one states and reduce spending for other states significantly. The proposed plan was meant to meet the wishes of both liberals and conservatives but had many features that they could oppose. The cost of the welfare program increased by $6 billion from the costs of the initial plan. The costs of the program concerned many in Congress, but it was not the only obstacle that Nixon had to worry about.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011).

Nixon's FAP was highlighted as a form of \u2018workfare\u2019 in hopes of incentivizing poorer families to continue working rather than seek unemployment welfare benefits. The initial FAP proposal was positively received, as many believed the previous welfare system in place (the ADFC) to be flawed. However, some critics were mixed in their reception. While some believed the requirements to work were either too harsh or not strict enough, others demanded expanded benefits to those in need.\n\nIn October 1969, an Administration Bill was proposed to amend the Social Security act of 1935 to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Included in the bill is a preliminary version of the FAP which was introduced by President Nixon earlier in August. The bill is referred to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] for approval.\n\nIn April 1970, after revisions were completed on its initial proposal, the October 1969 Administration bill, still including the FAP, was passed by the House of Representatives under [[closed rule]]. [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|The Senate Finance Committee]] subsequently received the bill for voting, and deemed the bill as insufficient due to potential bias towards families already in similar circumstances under the ADFC and continued possible welfare dependency. The committee requests further revisions of the FAP proposal by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].\u00a0 These revisions were completed in June 1970 and resubmitted to the Senate Finance committee for consideration.\n\nIn December 1970 a [[91st United States Congress|Ninety-First Congress]] meeting was held. The Senate Finance committee proposes a version of the October 1969 Administration Bill that does not include Nixon's FAP. However, the bill does call for up to five trial projects meant to test the suitability of incorporating the FAP as a welfare program should be undertaken. The bill itself included many other controversial topics, and as such the topic of FAP testing was not given full consideration until the later moments of the ninety-first congress. The confusion over multiple other proposals within the bill outlined by the Senate Finance committee delayed proper discussion around the proposed tests. Ultimately, the meeting of the Ninety-First Congress does not approve the FAP or its testing.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 603-605<br /></ref>\n\n=== 1971 - The FAP's inclusion in Bill H.R. 1 ===\n[[File:91st Congress United States House of Representatives.svg|thumb|Number of seats held by Democrats or Republicans in the House of Representatives during the 91st Congress]]\nBy January 1971, the FAP has been further revised and made even more complex in hopes of garnering approval by the Senate Finance Committee. The FAP is included in [[Bill H.R. 1]], another administration bill with the aim of amending the Social Security Act.\u00a0 Bill H.R 1 is put to the House of Representatives for voting. Almost 6 months later, in June, Bill H.R. 1 is passed, this time with the FAP included.\n\nIn December 1971, [[Herman Talmadge|Senator Herman E. Talmadge]] proposes an amendment to the current welfare system in place, the AFDC, to include a plan that incentives work and requires anybody over the age of 16 on the system to either begin work-related education/training or become employed. As a result,\u00a0considerations of alternate methods of welfare reform to the FAP begin to be debated.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 605-606</ref>\n\n=== 1972 - Removal of the FAP from Bill H.R. 1 ===\nIn June 1972, The inclusion of the FAP in the H.R. 1 Bill has been at the centre of many debates and negotiations. A compromise for the FAP is proposed by [[Abraham Ribicoff|Senator Abraham Ribicoff]], which would merge the FAP and his own plans of guaranteed income. A letter is sent to President Nixon in 1971 which denounced the FAP's plan of \u2018workfare\u2019 as well as any version of the H.R. 1 Bill which included the FAP as an unacceptable approach to welfare reform. In the same month, President Nixon approves a twenty percent increase in old-age and survivor's insurance benefits. Supporters of the FAP feared this may have decreased the likeliness that there would be a vote in favour of keeping the FAP as part of the amended H.R. 1 Bill, as it may have served to dissuade potential support amongst more conservative politicians who did not wish to see large change to the government's role in public services.\n\nBy September, the Senate Finance Committee has released a newly revised H.R. 1 Bill, which is over 900 pages in length. The FAP is voted to not be included in this amended version of the bill, instead choosing to have it replaced with a \u2018workfare\u2019 plan put forth by Senator Long. This plan was heavily supported by all Republican members of the committee. By October, voting on Bill H.R. 1 has begun. On October 3, the guaranteed income plan proposed by Senator Ribicoff is tabled 52\u201324. On October 4, the Senate also decides to drop the \u2018workfare\u2019 proposal by Senator Long. Tests of the Nixon FAP, Ribicoff's guaranteed income plan, and Long's \u2018workfare\u2019 are instead included in the bill.\n\nThe next day, on October 5, the H.R. 1 bill passes with a vote of 68\u20135. However, by the time President Nixon signed the bill on October 30, the proposal of these tests had also been removed from planning, despite the Senate having authorized funds for testing earlier in the month. When the H.R 1 Bill was put in action, no marked changes to welfare in America developed and the ADFC remained largely intact. After over three years of development, negotiations, and revisions, the FAP is entirely removed from consideration.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 606-608</ref>\n\n== Failure ==\nNixon's FAP came in a time of modern presidency where Congress sought to insert its power in the government affairs, be it scrutinizing existing programs or declining to enact new ones which the architects of the Family Assistance Plan hardly realized. The chances of passing such a program through Congress seemed \"too slim\".<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 350</ref> Firstly, a guaranteed income was deemed as \"immoral\" and \"impolitic\" due largely to tax increases and the disincentive to work. Many people in Congress did not believe that the plan would attract support from middle-class and working-class people, and even some calling it a \"[[political suicide]].\" Some \"[[Safe state|safe-seat]]\" liberals, however, favored the guaranteed income as an alternative to the existing system. The [[moderate]]s were mostly opposed to it because they believed that it was either morally wrong, or the political consequences of such a plan were far-reaching. Many in Congress preferred creating job opportunities and encouraging food stamps. The Family Assistance Plan was set to go through numerous tests and scrutiny in many different committees. In particular, since it was technically a tax bill, it would also be dealt with by the tax committees. Therefore, if successful, it would become a statute financed by the treasury automatically, representing significant commitment.<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 351-352</ref>\n\nThe conservative lawmakers regarded the new welfare program as a huge drain on the treasury of the nation, while the liberals concerned themselves with the work requirement of the FAP and its insufficient benefit level. The interest groups played an important role in the ultimate fate of the FAP. Take, for instance, the [[National Welfare Rights Organization]] (NWRO) who opposed the plan, calling for an alternative plan in which the government would increase the benefit level to $5500 with no work requirement attached to it. Many liberal organizations seemed to have ignored the fact that even the current proposal's price tag was very high, $4.4 billion.<ref>McNown, Robert F. 1973. \"THE STORY OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN.\" ''Current History'' 65 (384) (Aug 01): 57. <nowiki>http://ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/docview/1309776803?accountid=14656</nowiki>. pp. 59</ref>\n[[File:Russell Billiu Long.jpg|thumb|Russell. B. Long, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee During the voting process on Nixon's FAP]]\nWhen the bill reached the Senate Finance Committee, it faced its hardest test which ultimately led to its demise. From the political perspective, the bill was killed by both the Liberals who thought it was too \"stingy\" and the Conservatives who thought it would discourage people from working. Another point of concern for the Senate Finance Committee was the bill's inability to eliminate disparate effects among the recipients, in particular against the working male. The argument was that some non-working families would be receiving more benefits under the FAP than the working male because the latter would be ineligible to receive state supplements. Furthermore, the Senators brought up the continued issue of inequities. Although the FAP benefit rate would be the same across the nation, individual states still preserved their supplements which meant that the benefit level varied in different parts of the country.<ref name=\":6\">Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 60</ref>\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee instructed the administration to work out a revised plan that would address the issues brought up by the Committee. The revised plan did not substantially change the provisions of the FAP, but it proposed other benefit programs to be redesigned to fit the FAP. There was to be a gradual reduction in other welfare benefits such as housing, food stamps, and medical benefits as the income increased, just like the FAP benefits. Furthermore, the taxes that applied to the earnings of the FAP recipients increased significantly which reduced the incentive for many to find employment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe welfare reform for conservatives needed to \"force\" people back to employment, uncover welfare fraudsters, and identify male deserters. The FAP added 13 million to the welfare system; therefore, the FAP hardly seemed to be welfare reform. There was also some regional opposition to the bill. Particularly, Southerners quickly realized that the significant amount of federal relief to state finances would go toward bigger states like California and New York, based on federal assumptions of these states\u2019 welfare expenses. However, the majority of the FAP benefits would go toward poor people in Southern states. With a lack of support from both liberal and conservatives, the Family Assistance Plan had no prospect of passing the Senate despite much-needed welfare reforms.<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P.

Among local state officials, the FAP was viewed positively as a method of cutting local spending on welfare as the federal government would pay for the program.

The White House estimated the initial four hundred editorial press coverage concluded that over 90% of them had a positive assessment of Nixon's plan. Most argued in favor of the FAP citing a need to reform the existing welfare system which they declared that it was a failure. Among the editorials that were uncertain of the FAP, they argued that Nixon may not be able to achieve an effective roll out for this plan throughout the United States. Additionally, they also feared that this would increase government expenditure, expanding the national debt.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011).

It also aroused the fear of increased civic participation by black people.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 1968, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] predicted that political participation by black people especially in the South would increase once black people were able to become more economically self-sufficient.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\".

[[Department of Health, Education and Welfare|The Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) yielded different proportions of welfare benefits to each different region. Approximately 38% of the funds went to five Northeastern regions, another 13% were used for California, the other 32% were paid for fourteen four regions located in Northern areas while the southern states could not receive funds from other welfare policies. According to the estimation by HEW, 52% of the U.S. population who most benefit from the FAP would be from the South. President Nixon intended to eliminate regional discrimination through the program as well.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Labour Market ===\nThe reaction to FAP by business owners was mixed. The main concern business owners had with the FAP was an increase in average income would incentives people to opt for lower-wage jobs. As the FAP would supplement earnings for low income families, the labour could concentrate jobs with lower wages as people would be satisfied with working in menial jobs with lower pay.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\".

[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 21</ref> Additionally, small business owners also worried that people with FAP benefits would demand higher wages and better working environments in the future. On the other hand, owners of large businesses welcomed the FAP because they anticipated an increase in labour supply by males, especially in the low wage sector.<ref>Kornbluh, Felicia (2008-12-01). \"Who shot FAP? The Nixon welfare plan and the transformation of American politics\". ''The Sixties''. '''1''' (2): 125\u2013150. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1080/17541320802457038. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;1754-1328. pp. 138</ref> On the other hand, [[organized labour]] supported the FAP as it could contribute to an increase in the [[minimum wage]] and ameliorate social insurances for labourers. From the perspective of organized labour, the program was considered as an opportunity to reinforce labour unions through increasing labour supply. Organized labour groups were more inclined to support the FAP because those in [[skilled labour]] positions, often white males, did not feel threatened by increasing amounts of unskilled labour.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 22</ref> Ideologically, for moderate business leaders and organizations that did not hold low-income citizens responsible for their poverty, the FAP was popular as they thought it could quell urban violence as a form of their contribution to social justice. In contrast, conservative business owners also favored the FAP as they believed that this was a tough stance against welfare that could detach people from welfare assistance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Gender ===\nWomen thought the FAP, like previous [[welfare program]]s, emphasized the role of males in family as welfare was determined with labour participation. This meant women, who had irregular jobs with low wage or who stayed at home to focus on household affairs had to be economically dependent on their male family member. This increased male economic power in proportion to female economic power. This lowered the value of female labour participation as it reinforced male power and dominance over female family members.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 19</ref> Thus the government responding to potential inequality between male and female earnings, they proposed a daycare system alongside the FAP that could encourage mothers to participate in job training and employment. However, the funding only allocated $858 per year for family, when the HEW estimated daycare costs to be $2000 per year per family and did not suggest clear plans regarding its management. Additionally, daycare system beneficiaries would also experience a cut in their FAP funding.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\".

The FAP was dictated by economic policies that dominated American political discourse since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, where welfare expansion, especially towards his [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] white constituencies was a necessity for electoral success. Nixon favoured this [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] welfare program over conservatives because the FAP would have completely eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program making FAP the sole welfare program for the working poor. However, by 1968 expansion of welfare started to become an electoral liability as it increased the public's anxiety over racial, gender, and socio-cultural issues that became prominent in the 1960s. Even Nixon's own white constituencies were never able to ultimately support the FAP, despite the fact that they would also gain from the program. Conservative political figures subsequently learned from Nixon's failed FAP welfare reform that expansion of welfare to the working poor would not attract conservative voters. By [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's]] presidency, anti-welfare rhetoric became popular as he touted his avocation for small government. Thus by the end of the 20th century, the rhetoric against welfare which was partially reflected by Nixon himself in his proposal for the FAP became a [[normality]] in American politics.<ref>Spitzer, Scott J.

Nixon giving a speech - NARA - 194695.tif|thumb|433x433px|President Nixon delivering a speech in 1969 around the time the Family Assistance Plan was introduced.]]The Family Assistance Program (FAP) was a welfare program introduced by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1969, which aimed to implement a [[negative income tax]] for households with working parents. The FAP was influenced by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon B. Johnson's]] [[War on poverty|War on Poverty]] program that aimed to expand welfare across all American citizens, especially for [[Working class in the United States|working-class]] Americans. Nixon intended for the FAP to replace existing welfare programs such as the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|Aid to Assist Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program as a way to attract conservative voters that were beginning to become wary of welfare while maintaining middle-class constituencies. The FAP specifically provided aid assistance to working-class Americans, dividing benefits based on age, the number of children, family income, and eligibility. Initially, the Nixon administration thought the FAP legislation would easily pass through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the more liberal [[United States Senate|Senate]], as both chambers were controlled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In June 1971, the FAP under the bill H.R. 1 during the [[92nd United States Congress|92nd Congress]], passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. However, from December 1971 to June 1972 H.R.1\u00a0 bill that included the FAP underwent scrutiny in the Senate chamber, particularly by the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] controlled by the [[conservative Democrat]]s, while the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were also reluctant on passing the program. Eventually, on October 5 of 1972, a revised version of H.R.1 passed the Senate with a vote of 68-5 that only authorized\u00a0 funding for FAP testing before its implementation. Nevertheless, before Nixon signed the bill on October 15, 1972 the entire provision on FAP was dropped. The FAP enjoyed broad support from Americans across different regions. Reception towards the program varied across racial, regional, income, and gender differences. The FAP is best remembered for beginning the rhetoric against the expansion of welfare that was popular during the [[New Deal]]. It initiated the support for anti-welfare conservative movements that became mainstream in American political discourse during the [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== The Need for the Family Assistance Program - Controversy over the AFDC ===\nWhen President Nixon took office in 1968, issues pertaining to poverty and welfare in the United States had been at the forefront of many political discussions, largely stemming from prior [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson's]] proclaimed \"[[war on poverty]]\" in 1964. Welfare and social insurance had been a federal responsibility as early as the 1930s, when state-sponsored welfare was replaced with \"social security\" networks headed by the Federal government which included commonly considered aspects of welfare support such as unemployment benefits, workers compensation, and veterans' payments. The [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]] dictated welfare as a \"layered system\" in which five \"layers\" of income protection - ranging from private insurance, social insurance, and categorical assistance - acted to reduce the threats of poverty. Those that created the bill hoped that the act would create a dynamic that would not only reduce the amount of poverty in the nation, but in doing also reduce the need for social insurance as more and more citizens became able to support themselves free of welfare aid.<ref name=\":0\">Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp 1-5.</ref>\n\nHowever, by the 1960s, a program that had been created with the [[Social Security Act|Social Security Act of 1935]] to support families at risk, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]] (Aid to Assist Families with Dependant Children), had only continued to expand. From 1965\u20131970, the ADFC experienced an expansion of 110 percent, and its rapid growth\u00a0had become a heated topic of debate for both the Democratic and Republican party as welfare costs for the government increased.<ref name=\":2\" /> By the time Nixon came into presidency, the projected cost of the AFDC was 6 billion dollars annually, straining already tight state and federal budgets.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp 5.</ref> The rapid expansion of this program stemmed largely from the liberalization of its requirements through the 1950s and early 1960s, in which the eligible age for a child to be a dependant to 21, and the eligibility of families whose primary \u2018breadwinner\u2019 had been unemployed for long periods of time. At the time of Nixon's FAP speech in 1969, the primary beneficiaries of the AFDC were families who had undergone a breakup through divorce, desertion, or illegitimacy - which were decisively more common than families needing assistance for unavoidable hardships like the death of a father.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp. 3</ref>\n\nThe rising costs and liberalization of the AFDC not only caused congressional backlash but also brought with it racially charged and negative responses by states burdened with increasing numbers of AFDC recipients. Indications within congress and the public began to hint at a perception of rising welfare issues to be a largely minority or immigrant issue. Legislation was passed in Louisiana which declared children born out of wedlock or families cohabiting without an official marriage license to be inadmissible for AFDC benefits. Around 6,000 families were dropped, only 5% of whom were of Caucasian background. In 1961, aggravations revolving the AFDC came to a head in the small town of [[Newburgh, New York]] in what popularity became known as the \u2018Battle of Newburgh\u2019. Facing a sudden spike in welfare applicants due to tough economic conditions during the winter of 1961, City Manager [[Joseph Mitchell (city manager)|Joseph McDowell Mitchell]] placed the blame on this rise in welfare costs primarily on immigration into the city. Mitchell proposed changes to the AFDC which included a requirement of proof that the beneficiary was entering Newburgh with a work position, a change to aid divvied out by voucher rather than cash, and denial of aid to those not working or to new children conceived while the family was receiving welfare assistance.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Asen|first=Robert|date=2001-06-01|title=Nixon's Welfare Reform: Enacting Historical Contradictions of Poverty Discourses|journal=Rhetoric & Public Affairs|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=261\u2013279|doi=10.1353/rap.2001.0019|issn=1534-5238}}</ref>\n\nWhile Newburgh was only a small town of 30,000, the controversial proposals made by Mitchell received national attention, and polls conducted by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] showed that up to 74% of the population surveyed agreed with Mitchell that welfare should only be given to immigrants who came with a definite job opportunity and means of work. Further Gallup polls in 1964 found that over 50% of participants believed a 60-day residency should be required before an individual could be able to apply for AFDC welfare. Many also began to\u00a0 attribute the need for welfare as laziness, or a combination of misfortune and laziness. A common idea that began to spring up in discussions was the split between those \u2018deserving\u2019 or \u2018undeserving\u2019 or welfare. Highlighting this split was the notion that those \u2018undeserving\u2019 of welfare assistance were largely not working and instead coasting off of the benefits received. Some believed women were having children precisely to play the system and further the benefits they were receiving from AFDC.<ref name=\":1\" /> Indeed, this cultural divide between the deserving and undeserving would continue to underscore public opinion on welfare not only as the AFDC was debated, but in later moments as well in discussions of Nixon's FAP.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steensland|first=Brian|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1185904/pdf|title=The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3748-9|location=|pages=28\u201352|language=English}}</ref>\n\nDespite public frustration and debates over adding restrictions to the AFDC to control costs, there was still a large number of the public which considered poverty aid to be a universal, basic right. A 1964 Harris poll found that 68% of participants believed the Federal government had a responsibility to ensure basic human rights and a minimum livable wage to its citizens, reaffirmed by 73% of participants in a later 1969 poll. Poverty and inequality had been raised as an issue by Johnson in 1964, and pressure was continuing to be placed on the Federal government to alleviate rising national poverty rates. Instances of riots and public disgruntlement plaguing the 1960s were connected to a welfare system not adequately supporting the needs of the population.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTo many in congress, it was clear that the answer was not to restrict the AFDC, but rather reform it. The AFDC was plagued with numerous inequalities not only among its recipients but between states. In 1968, 26 states did not pass the threshold for welfare support from the AFDC that allowed families to be above the \u2018poverty-line\u2019. Families in New Jersey could receive up to 332 dollars a month, whereas some families in Mississippi were receiving a comparatively meager 55 dollars a month. The AFDC also overwhelmingly denied access to assistance to families who had an employed head, even if their overall income still placed them below the poverty line. In 1966, this excluded around 12 million families from access to the AFDC. As such, there were fears that the AFDC created instances of dependency for those unable to work, as well as dis-incentivized families on welfare assistance to find work. In 1967, legislation pushed for a work-incentive phase (WIN) to AFDC, which required families currently on the program to participate in job/work training to continue receiving benefits.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Heyman|first=Philip|title=The Family Assistance Plan: Abridged|publisher=Kennedy School of Government|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> By early January 1969, the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] had installed a committee to study the welfare system and propose changes, culminating in the eventual announcement of the FAP in August 1969. Nixon's plan envisioned a welfare system that ventured not only to fix [[welfare dependency]] and rising costs for government, but also aimed to combat rising inequality within the welfare system and afford income assistance as a basic, universal right.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Nixon's Political Motivations ===\nMotivations to reform welfare and introduce the FAP were not only grounded in moral terms of eradicating poverty in the United States. As documents were opened in the [[Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum|Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library]] (RNPL), it has become clear that much of the reasoning behind Nixon's proposal of the FAP may have come from an attempt to appease the worries of a predominately white lower and middle working class. Nixon highlighted this as his \u2018Northern Strategy\u2019 - efforts to garner votes and support from blue-collar workers in industrialized states where the working class was predominantly white. Nixon viewed this group of people as his \u2018silent majority\u2019 - a ticket to winning popularity from a larger majority of Americans. Nixon therefore objectively took a moderate/centrist stance in his implementation of the FAP, noting that conservatives would likely find issue in welfare reform, especially if it blurred racial lines. In this context, the FAP was largely chosen as it redistributed welfare benefits to the working class poor, who were largely Caucasian in ethnicity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Spitzer|first=Scott J.|date=2012|title=Nixon's New Deal: Welfare Reform for the Silent Majority|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=455\u2013481|doi=10.1111/j.1741-5705.2012.03989.x|issn=1741-5705}}</ref> Indeed, one estimate indicated that there would be a shift in the ethnicity of beneficiaries from 51.7% non-white in the 1969 AFDC program to 38.6% non-white in the FAP program by 1972.<ref>Bowler, M. Kenneth. ''The Nixon guaranteed income proposal: Substance and process in policy change''. Ballinger Publishing Company, 1974.</ref> By creating an entirely new system of welfare reform, Nixon was also separating himself from liberal policy makers like former president Johnson, gaining him an edge politically. The FAP also addressed both leftist qualms with the AFDC over inadequate welfare assistance and welfare inequality while also addressing criticisms of the AFDC from the right over welfare dependency and dis-incentives to work. By proposing the FAP, Nixon hoped he could not only garner praise from liberals seeking more egalitarian welfare reform but also appeal to a new kind of veiled, latent racial conservatism.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Specific Provisions of the Family Assistance Plan ==\n\n=== Initial Proposal ===\nThe initial proposal of guaranteed income by the Nixon administration would include all poor families \u2013 \"[[working poor]],\" \"[[Dependant|dependent]],\" and poor families headed by a male. The benefit level would not be reduced for families currently enrolled in the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]], for states were required to compensate for the difference between proposed minimum payment and the state's current benefit level. States would be receiving federal assistance, so none would be required to supplement the incomes of the working poor.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 115-116</ref> The essential details of Nixon's initial plan included the following:\n\n1. \tOnly families with unmarried children under 18 years of age or 21 if still in school, are eligible for the benefit under the FAP.\n\n2. \tA family of 4 with no other income is eligible for a maximum of $1600\n\n* The same family of 4 sees no change in the amount of benefit up to the income of $720; and\n* Any other income beyond $720 would be taxed at the rate of 50% until the [[Break-even (economics)|break-even point]] or until a point where the benefit would fall to zero, $3920, except:\n**For the earnings from [[Veteran's pension (United States)|Veteran's pension]] and certain farm payments as these are taxed at 100%; \n**For children's earnings, welfare payments and other applicable payments as these are not taxable; and\n**For some [[Child care|child-care]] expenses which are also excluded from income calculation.\n\n3. \tFamilies in possession of resources amounting to over $1500 and a home, personal household goods and other resources or properties considered essential to family's self-support would be ineligible for the FAP benefits unless they dispose of excess possessions at a specified rate.\n\n4. \tFor the purposes of the FAP eligibility, a family is defined to only include family members who are related by blood, marriage or adoption except in the case of a stepfather who shall be considered to be a member of the family. The following category of people are excluded from a family unit:\n\n* Members not living in the same household, in-laws, grandparents, and 20-year-old adults not in school whose income information may be unavailable to the other family members;\n* Members of the Armed forces and their spouses and children;\n* Recipients of the aid to the aged, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently and totally disabled, and their dependents;\n* Although the income period is set to be one year, for the purposes of calculating the FAP benefits, the family's current quarterly income is taken into account.\n* Any over or underpayments are to be fixed upon detection.\n\n5. \tRefusal of taking on a \"suitable\" work or training \u2013 that is, registering with the state employment service- by [[able-bodied]] family members including single women may result in the reduction of the FAP benefits.\n\n* The women heads of family who are not in the [[Full-time job|full-time]] workforce and whose youngest child is over 6 years old.\n* Mothers whose youngest child is under 6 years old are exempt from meeting the work requirement.<ref>Lampman, Robert James. 1969. ''Nixon's Family Assistance Plan''. Vol. 57-69;57-69.;. Madison: Institute for Research on Poverty, University of Wisconsin. pp. 19-20</ref>\n\n=== 1972 Revisions ===\nThe Family Assistance Plan was revised in 1972 in an attempt to make it more palatable on the Senate floor. The specific provisions that were changed consist of the following:\n\n1. \tThe new plan replaced [[Food Stamps|food stamps]] with an increase in cash benefits from $1600 to $2400 for a family of 4;\n\n2. \tThe tax rate for income earned changed from 50% to 67%;\n\n3. \tThe requirement for \"work\" was tightened in a way that required beneficiaries to sign up for the full-time work training to increase their chances of employment and their skills;\n\n4. \tThe exemption of work requirement that applied to mothers whose dependent child was under 6 years old changed. Under the newly revised plan, the exemption only applied to mothers if their dependent child is under 3 years old;<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 161</ref>\n\n5. \tThe breakeven point for tax-exempt income changed from $3920 to $4320.<ref>Erickson, John V. and Mark L. Wolf. 1972. \"Work Incentive Aspects of the Family Assistance Plan.\" ''Harvard Journal on Legislation'' 9: 179-216. pp. 182</ref>\n\nUnder the new plan, the states received even more fiscal relief from the Federal government. They were no longer required to supplement the payments above the established benefit level. The new plan would completely eliminate the welfare expenditures of twenty-one states and reduce spending for other states significantly. The proposed plan was meant to meet the wishes of both liberals and conservatives but had many features that they could oppose. The cost of the welfare program increased by $6 billion from the costs of the initial plan. The costs of the program concerned many in Congress, but it was not the only obstacle that Nixon had to worry about.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 162</ref>\n\n== Legislative History ==\n\n=== 1969-1970 - Introduction and Revision of the FAP ===\n[[File:Hewseal.gif|thumb|Seal of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]\nThe first formal proposal of the FAP was introduced to the American public in August 1969 when President Nixon set forth his new goals of welfare reform during a televised address. Nixon's FAP was highlighted as a form of \u2018workfare\u2019 in hopes of incentivizing poorer families to continue working rather than seek unemployment welfare benefits. The initial FAP proposal was positively received, as many believed the previous welfare system in place (the ADFC) to be flawed. However, some critics were mixed in their reception. While some believed the requirements to work were either too harsh or not strict enough, others demanded expanded benefits to those in need.\n\nIn October 1969, an Administration Bill was proposed to amend the Social Security act of 1935 to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Included in the bill is a preliminary version of the FAP which was introduced by President Nixon earlier in August. The bill is referred to the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]] for approval.\n\nIn April 1970, after revisions were completed on its initial proposal, the October 1969 Administration bill, still including the FAP, was passed by the House of Representatives under [[closed rule]]. [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|The Senate Finance Committee]] subsequently received the bill for voting, and deemed the bill as insufficient due to potential bias towards families already in similar circumstances under the ADFC and continued possible welfare dependency. The committee requests further revisions of the FAP proposal by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]].\u00a0 These revisions were completed in June 1970 and resubmitted to the Senate Finance committee for consideration.\n\nIn December 1970 a [[91st United States Congress|Ninety-First Congress]] meeting was held. The Senate Finance committee proposes a version of the October 1969 Administration Bill that does not include Nixon's FAP. However, the bill does call for up to five trial projects meant to test the suitability of incorporating the FAP as a welfare program should be undertaken. The bill itself included many other controversial topics, and as such the topic of FAP testing was not given full consideration until the later moments of the ninety-first congress. The confusion over multiple other proposals within the bill outlined by the Senate Finance committee delayed proper discussion around the proposed tests. Ultimately, the meeting of the Ninety-First Congress does not approve the FAP or its testing.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 603-605<br /></ref>\n\n=== 1971 - The FAP's inclusion in Bill H.R. 1 ===\n[[File:91st Congress United States House of Representatives.svg|thumb|Number of seats held by Democrats or Republicans in the House of Representatives during the 91st Congress]]\nBy January 1971, the FAP has been further revised and made even more complex in hopes of garnering approval by the Senate Finance Committee. The FAP is included in [[Bill H.R. 1]], another administration bill with the aim of amending the Social Security Act.\u00a0 Bill H.R 1 is put to the House of Representatives for voting. Almost 6 months later, in June, Bill H.R. 1 is passed, this time with the FAP included.\n\nIn December 1971, [[Herman Talmadge|Senator Herman E. Talmadge]] proposes an amendment to the current welfare system in place, the AFDC, to include a plan that incentives work and requires anybody over the age of 16 on the system to either begin work-related education/training or become employed. As a result,\u00a0considerations of alternate methods of welfare reform to the FAP begin to be debated.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 605-606</ref>\n\n=== 1972 - Removal of the FAP from Bill H.R. 1 ===\nIn June 1972, The inclusion of the FAP in the H.R. 1 Bill has been at the centre of many debates and negotiations. A compromise for the FAP is proposed by [[Abraham Ribicoff|Senator Abraham Ribicoff]], which would merge the FAP and his own plans of guaranteed income. A letter is sent to President Nixon in 1971 which denounced the FAP's plan of \u2018workfare\u2019 as well as any version of the H.R. 1 Bill which included the FAP as an unacceptable approach to welfare reform. In the same month, President Nixon approves a twenty percent increase in old-age and survivor's insurance benefits. Supporters of the FAP feared this may have decreased the likeliness that there would be a vote in favour of keeping the FAP as part of the amended H.R. 1 Bill, as it may have served to dissuade potential support amongst more conservative politicians who did not wish to see large change to the government's role in public services.\n\nBy September, the Senate Finance Committee has released a newly revised H.R. 1 Bill, which is over 900 pages in length. The FAP is voted to not be included in this amended version of the bill, instead choosing to have it replaced with a \u2018workfare\u2019 plan put forth by Senator Long. This plan was heavily supported by all Republican members of the committee. By October, voting on Bill H.R. 1 has begun. On October 3, the guaranteed income plan proposed by Senator Ribicoff is tabled 52\u201324. On October 4, the Senate also decides to drop the \u2018workfare\u2019 proposal by Senator Long. Tests of the Nixon FAP, Ribicoff's guaranteed income plan, and Long's \u2018workfare\u2019 are instead included in the bill.\n\nThe next day, on October 5, the H.R. 1 bill passes with a vote of 68\u20135. However, by the time President Nixon signed the bill on October 30, the proposal of these tests had also been removed from planning, despite the Senate having authorized funds for testing earlier in the month. When the H.R 1 Bill was put in action, no marked changes to welfare in America developed and the ADFC remained largely intact. After over three years of development, negotiations, and revisions, the FAP is entirely removed from consideration.<ref>\"The Family-Assistance Plan: A Chronology.\" 1972.''Social Service Review'' 46 (4): pp. 606-608</ref>\n\n== Failure ==\nNixon's FAP came in a time of modern presidency where Congress sought to insert its power in the government affairs, be it scrutinizing existing programs or declining to enact new ones which the architects of the Family Assistance Plan hardly realized. The chances of passing such a program through Congress seemed \"too slim\".<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 350</ref> Firstly, a guaranteed income was deemed as \"immoral\" and \"impolitic\" due largely to tax increases and the disincentive to work. Many people in Congress did not believe that the plan would attract support from middle-class and working-class people, and even some calling it a \"[[political suicide]].\" Some \"[[Safe state|safe-seat]]\" liberals, however, favored the guaranteed income as an alternative to the existing system. The [[moderate]]s were mostly opposed to it because they believed that it was either morally wrong, or the political consequences of such a plan were far-reaching. Many in Congress preferred creating job opportunities and encouraging food stamps. The Family Assistance Plan was set to go through numerous tests and scrutiny in many different committees. In particular, since it was technically a tax bill, it would also be dealt with by the tax committees. Therefore, if successful, it would become a statute financed by the treasury automatically, representing significant commitment.<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 351-352</ref>\n\nThe conservative lawmakers regarded the new welfare program as a huge drain on the treasury of the nation, while the liberals concerned themselves with the work requirement of the FAP and its insufficient benefit level. The interest groups played an important role in the ultimate fate of the FAP. Take, for instance, the [[National Welfare Rights Organization]] (NWRO) who opposed the plan, calling for an alternative plan in which the government would increase the benefit level to $5500 with no work requirement attached to it. Many liberal organizations seemed to have ignored the fact that even the current proposal's price tag was very high, $4.4 billion.<ref>McNown, Robert F. 1973. \"THE STORY OF THE FAMILY ASSISTANCE PLAN.\" ''Current History'' 65 (384) (Aug 01): 57. <nowiki>http://ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/docview/1309776803?accountid=14656</nowiki>. pp. 59</ref>\n[[File:Russell Billiu Long.jpg|thumb|Russell. B. Long, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee During the voting process on Nixon's FAP]]\nWhen the bill reached the Senate Finance Committee, it faced its hardest test which ultimately led to its demise. From the political perspective, the bill was killed by both the Liberals who thought it was too \"stingy\" and the Conservatives who thought it would discourage people from working. Another point of concern for the Senate Finance Committee was the bill's inability to eliminate disparate effects among the recipients, in particular against the working male. The argument was that some non-working families would be receiving more benefits under the FAP than the working male because the latter would be ineligible to receive state supplements. Furthermore, the Senators brought up the continued issue of inequities. Although the FAP benefit rate would be the same across the nation, individual states still preserved their supplements which meant that the benefit level varied in different parts of the country.<ref name=\":6\">Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 60</ref>\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee instructed the administration to work out a revised plan that would address the issues brought up by the Committee. The revised plan did not substantially change the provisions of the FAP, but it proposed other benefit programs to be redesigned to fit the FAP. There was to be a gradual reduction in other welfare benefits such as housing, food stamps, and medical benefits as the income increased, just like the FAP benefits. Furthermore, the taxes that applied to the earnings of the FAP recipients increased significantly which reduced the incentive for many to find employment.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe welfare reform for conservatives needed to \"force\" people back to employment, uncover welfare fraudsters, and identify male deserters. The FAP added 13 million to the welfare system; therefore, the FAP hardly seemed to be welfare reform. There was also some regional opposition to the bill. Particularly, Southerners quickly realized that the significant amount of federal relief to state finances would go toward bigger states like California and New York, based on federal assumptions of these states\u2019 welfare expenses. However, the majority of the FAP benefits would go toward poor people in Southern states. With a lack of support from both liberal and conservatives, the Family Assistance Plan had no prospect of passing the Senate despite much-needed welfare reforms.<ref>Moynihan, Daniel P. The Politics of a Guaranteed Income; the Nixon Administration and the Family Assistance Plan. New York, Random House, 1973. pp. 61</ref>\n\n== Perspectives, Arguments, and Public Opinion ==\n\n=== Legislative Expectation ===\nThe Family Assistance Program by [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]] was predicted to receive positive reactions from various groups including the American public, specific groups related to workers and political parties. It was because the Family Assistance Program was designed to provide welfare benefits for people by the government for American prosperity.<ref name=\"Steensland, Brian 2011\">Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 120</ref> They also wanted to increase marriage rates with an increased family income from one working husband. This also intended to develop a concept of \"[[workfare]]\" to inspire Americans\u00a0 to work.<ref>Kornbluh, Felicia (2008-12-01). \"Who shot FAP?

[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;1754-1328. pp. 132</ref> The [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] also had thought that public perception of FAP would have bipartisan support, as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] would support a welfare expansion while Republicans would also consider it as basic income, associated with the Economist Milton Friedman. Among local state officials, the FAP was viewed positively as a method of cutting local spending on welfare as the federal government would pay for the program. The [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] had opposed the FAP based not on welfare expansion but because of their fear that the working poor would be too dependent on welfare, decreasing working productivity.<ref name=\":5\">Steensland, Brian (2011).

Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 121</ref>\n\n=== Media/Public Polling ===\nThe FAP was well received by the public according to public polls. In 1970 some public opinion polls by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] showed support as high as 65%, particularly when the survey question had emphasized work incentives in the FAP.<ref name=\":3\">Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 124</ref> The Nixon administration also received 2700 letters and telegrams, which they identified that they were mostly from middle-class Americans, in which over 80% of them expressed enthusiastic support for the FAP. Another 10% of them had certain reservations and notes on improvements but also supported the proposal.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMedia across the United States also reacted positively to the FAP. The White House estimated the initial four hundred editorial press coverage concluded that over 90% of them had a positive assessment of Nixon's plan. Most argued in favor of the FAP citing a need to reform the existing welfare system which they declared that it was a failure. Among the editorials that were uncertain of the FAP, they argued that Nixon may not be able to achieve an effective roll out for this plan throughout the United States. Additionally, they also feared that this would increase government expenditure, expanding the national debt.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011).

Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 123</ref>\n\n=== Race/Region ===\nThe FAP was expected to be well received in the South, where African Americans, who did not receive as much welfare benefits in proportion to White Americans would welcome the program.<ref name=\"Steensland, Brian 2011\"/> Among the 52% of the U.S. population obtaining the FAP, two-thirds of them would have been impoverished African Americans.<ref name=\":4\">Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\".

[[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 23</ref> Additionally, one of the biggest factors in deciding the amount of benefits from the FAP a family could receive was based on the family size. As African Americans in rural regions had on average a larger family size compared to white families living in urbanized regions, the FAP disproportionately benefited black families.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 23-24</ref> Among African Americans, people living in the south supported the FAP as it would vastly increase their minimal income, while northern Americans feared the FAP could cut existing welfare.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 26</ref> Nevertheless, the FAP raised concerns for White Americans as they resented that black people, especially in the rural South, could receive more benefits that could increase their living standards. For white people, this meant that the FAP could increase civil rights for black people, such as education and speeches. It also aroused the fear of increased civic participation by black people.<ref name=\":4\" /> In 1968, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] predicted that political participation by black people especially in the South would increase once black people were able to become more economically self-sufficient.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 24</ref> Thus the Southern Democratic establishment, the [[conservative Democrat]]s, opposed the FAP as they thought giving a [[Basic income|universal basic income]] could equalize the power among African Americans and the Whites in the south. As the conservative Democrats controlled the Senate Finance Committee, the FAP would ultimately be rejected in 1971.<ref>Steensland, Brian (2011). ''The Failed Welfare Revolution: America's Struggle over Guaranteed Income Policy''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4008-3748-9}}. pp. 122</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the southern states were also expected to receive the most benefit out of the FAP. The South on average received less in welfare benefits from the government compared to the North. [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare|The Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) yielded different proportions of welfare benefits to each different region. Approximately 38% of the funds went to five Northeastern regions, another 13% were used for California, the other 32% were paid for fourteen four regions located in Northern areas while the southern states could not receive funds from other welfare policies. According to the estimation by HEW, 52% of the U.S. population who most benefit from the FAP would be from the South. President Nixon intended to eliminate regional discrimination through the program as well.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Labour Market ===\nThe reaction to FAP by business owners was mixed. The main concern business owners had with the FAP was an increase in average income would incentives people to opt for lower-wage jobs. As the FAP would supplement earnings for low income families, the labour could concentrate jobs with lower wages as people would be satisfied with working in menial jobs with lower pay.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 21</ref> Additionally, small business owners also worried that people with FAP benefits would demand higher wages and better working environments in the future. On the other hand, owners of large businesses welcomed the FAP because they anticipated an increase in labour supply by males, especially in the low wage sector.<ref>Kornbluh, Felicia (2008-12-01). \"Who shot FAP? The Nixon welfare plan and the transformation of American politics\". ''The Sixties''. '''1''' (2): 125\u2013150. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.1080/17541320802457038. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;1754-1328. pp. 138</ref> On the other hand, [[organized labour]] supported the FAP as it could contribute to an increase in the [[minimum wage]] and ameliorate social insurances for labourers. From the perspective of organized labour, the program was considered as an opportunity to reinforce labour unions through increasing labour supply. Organized labour groups were more inclined to support the FAP because those in [[skilled labour]] positions, often white males, did not feel threatened by increasing amounts of unskilled labour.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 22</ref> Ideologically, for moderate business leaders and organizations that did not hold low-income citizens responsible for their poverty, the FAP was popular as they thought it could quell urban violence as a form of their contribution to social justice. In contrast, conservative business owners also favored the FAP as they believed that this was a tough stance against welfare that could detach people from welfare assistance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Gender ===\nWomen thought the FAP, like previous [[welfare program]]s, emphasized the role of males in family as welfare was determined with labour participation. This meant women, who had irregular jobs with low wage or who stayed at home to focus on household affairs had to be economically dependent on their male family member. This increased male economic power in proportion to female economic power. This lowered the value of female labour participation as it reinforced male power and dominance over female family members.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp. 19</ref> Thus the government responding to potential inequality between male and female earnings, they proposed a daycare system alongside the FAP that could encourage mothers to participate in job training and employment. However, the funding only allocated $858 per year for family, when the HEW estimated daycare costs to be $2000 per year per family and did not suggest clear plans regarding its management. Additionally, daycare system beneficiaries would also experience a cut in their FAP funding.<ref>Quadagno, Jill (1990). \"Race, Class, and Gender in the U.S. Welfare State: Nixon's Failed Family Assistance Plan\". ''American Sociological Review''. '''55''' (1): 11\u201328. [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:10.2307/2095700. [[International Standard Serial Number|ISSN]]&nbsp;0003-1224. pp.17</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nNixon's FAP was one of the [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] policies that reflected the New Deal era that led to the expansion of welfare across the United States. The FAP was dictated by economic policies that dominated American political discourse since Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s, where welfare expansion, especially towards his [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] white constituencies was a necessity for electoral success. Nixon favoured this [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] welfare program over conservatives because the FAP would have completely eliminated the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program making FAP the sole welfare programs for the working poor. However, by 1968 expansion of welfare started to become an electoral liability as it increased the public's anxiety over racial, gender, and socio-cultural issues that became prominent in the 1960s. Even Nixon's own white constituencies were never able to ultimately support the FAP, despite the fact that they would also gain from the program. Conservative political figures subsequently learned from Nixon's failed FAP welfare reform that expansion of welfare to the working poor would not attract conservative voters. By [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald Reagan's]] presidency, anti-welfare rhetoric became popular as he touted his avocation for small government. Thus by the end of the 20th century, the rhetoric against welfare which was partially reflected by Nixon himself in his proposal for the FAP became a [[normality]] in American politics.<ref>Spitzer, Scott J.
