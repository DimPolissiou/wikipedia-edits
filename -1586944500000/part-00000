Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia. In the absence of further data, the researchers involved in the study speculated that Javan and Sumatran dholes could have been introduced to the islands by humans.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Iyengar, A. |author2=Babu, V.

Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

Certain people, such as the [[Kuruba|Kurumbas]] and some [[Mon Khmer]]-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]]. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites.

Persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 [[rupee]]s, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward.<ref name=\"f109\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=109}}</ref> In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/>\n\nThe [[fur trade]] does not pose a significant threat to dholes.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> The people of India do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> Due to their rarity, dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the [[Soviet Union]] and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts (being labeled as \"half wolf\" for the latter). The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s.

They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes.

Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

Infectious pathogens such as ''[[Toxocara canis]]'' are present in their faeces. They may suffer from [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[mange]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[canine parvovirus]] and [[endoparasite]]s such as [[cestode]]s and [[roundworm]]s.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/>\n\n==Threats==\nThe dhole only rarely takes domestic livestock. Certain people, such as the [[Kuruba|Kurumbas]] and some [[Mon Khmer]]-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]]. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites. Native Indian people killed dholes primarily to protect livestock, while British sporthunters during the [[British Raj]] did so under the conviction that dholes were responsible for drops in [[Game (hunting)|game]] populations. Persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 [[rupee]]s, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward.<ref name=\"f109\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=109}}</ref> In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/>\n\nThe [[fur trade]] does not pose a significant threat to dholes.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> The people of India do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> Due to their rarity, dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the [[Soviet Union]] and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts (being labeled as \"half wolf\" for the latter). The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s. In 2014, the Indian government sanctioned its first dhole conservation breeding centre at the [[Indira Gandhi Zoological Park]] (IGZP) in [[Visakhapatnam]].<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/zoo-to-have-conservation-breeding-centre-for-dhole/article6326027.ece Zoo to have conservation breeding centre for \u2018dhole\u2019], ''The Hindu'' (August 18, 2014)</ref> The dhole has been protected in Russia since 1974, though it is vulnerable to poison left out for wolves. In China, the animal is listed as a category II protected species under the Chinese wildlife protection act of 1988. In [[Cambodia]], the dhole is protected from all hunting, while conservation laws in Vietnam limit extraction and utilisation.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nIn 2016, the Korean company Sooam Biotech was reported to be attempting to clone the dhole using dogs as surrogate mothers to help conserve the species.<ref name=\"NewScientist500\">{{cite magazine|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|magazine=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==In culture and literature==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 1 Rubel Rothund.gif\n| width1 = 180\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Russian ruble]]\n| image2 = Coin of Kazakhstan 500RedWolf reverse.jpg\n| width2 = 180\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Kazakhstani tenge]]\n| footer = \n}}\nThree dhole-like animals are featured on the [[Coping (architecture)|coping]] stone of the [[Bharhut]] [[stupa]] dating from 100 BC.

This fear and superstition was not, however, shared by neighbouring [[Tungusic peoples]].\n\nVon Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle.<ref name=\"schrenk1859\">{{in lang|de}} [[Leopold von Schrenck|Schrenk, L. v.]] (1859), [https://archive.org/stream/reisenundforschu0112schr#page/48/mode/2up ''Reisen und forschungen im Amur-lande in den jahren 1854\u20131856''], St. Petersburg : K.

The Montefalcone family's [[coat of arms]] had a pair of red dogs as supporters.<ref name=\"smith1839\"/>\n\nDholes appear in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Red Dog (Kipling short story)|Red Dog]]'', where they are portrayed as aggressive and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the [[Deccan Plateau]] into the [[Seoni, Madhya Pradesh|Seeonee Hills]] inhabited by [[Mowgli]] and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.\n\nJapanese author Uchida Roan wrote \u72ac\u7269\u8a9e (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.<ref>Skabelund, A. H. (2011). ''Empire of Dogs: Canines, Japan, and the Making of the Modern Imperial World''. Cornell University Press, p. 85, {{ISBN|0801463246}}</ref> A fictional version of the dhole, imbued with supernatural abilities, appears in the season 6 episode of TV series ''[[The X-Files]]'', titled \"[[Alpha (The X-Files)|Alpha]]\".\n\nDholes also appear as enemies in the [[video game]] ''[[Far Cry 4]]'', alongside other predators such as the [[Bengal tiger]], [[honey badger]], [[snow leopard]], [[clouded leopard]], [[Tibetan wolf]] and [[Asian black bear]]. They can be found hunting the player and other [[non-player character|NPCs]] across the map, but are easily killed, being one of the weakest enemies in the game. They once again appear in the video game ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'', where they play similar roles as their counterparts in the previous game, but can now also be tamed and used in combat by Takkar, the main protagonist of the game.\n\n===Tameability===\n[[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] kept captured dholes in captivity, and found, with the exception of one animal, they remained shy and vicious even after 10 months.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> According to [[Richard Lydekker]], adult dholes are nearly impossible to tame, though pups are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pups until they reach early adulthood.<ref name=\"lydekker1907\"/> A dhole may have been presented as a gift to [[Ibbi-Sin]] as tribute.<ref>McIntosh, J.

Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control.<ref>{{harvp|Faber|2010|p=57}}</ref> He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate [[Joe Pignatano]] said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. [[Jackie Robinson]], in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched for weeks at a time.<ref>[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\nTo prepare for the {{mlby|1957}} season, the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] sent Koufax to [[Puerto Rico]] to play winter ball. On May 15, the restriction on sending Koufax down to the minors was lifted. Alston gave him a chance to justify his place on the major league roster by giving him the next day's start. Facing the [[1957 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at [[Wrigley Field]], Koufax struck out 13 while pitching his first complete game in almost two years. For the first time in his career, he was in the starting rotation, but only for two weeks. Despite winning three of his next five with a 2.90 ERA, Koufax did not get another start for 45 days. In that start, he struck out 11 in seven innings, but got a no-decision. On September 29, Koufax became the last man to pitch for the Brooklyn Dodgers before their move to Los Angeles, by throwing an inning of relief in the final game of the season.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 117\u2013124; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 87\u201390.</ref>\n\nOver the next three seasons, Koufax was in and out of the Dodger starting rotation due to injuries. In 1958, he began 7\u20133, but sprained his ankle in a collision at first base, finishing the season at 11\u201311 and leading the NL in wild pitches. In June 1959, Koufax set the record for a night game with 16 strikeouts. On August 31, 1959, he surpassed his career high with 18 strikeouts, setting the NL record and tying [[Bob Feller]]'s major league record for strikeouts in one game.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 125\u2013138; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 90\u201392; {{cite web|title=Box score and play by play|publisher=Retrosheet|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B08310LAN1959.htm|accessdate=February 17, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1959}}, the Dodgers won a close pennant race against the [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|Braves]] and the [[1959 San Francisco Giants season|Giants]], then beat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]]. Koufax pitched two perfect relief innings in the Series opener, though they came after the Dodgers were already behind 11\u20130. Alston gave him the start in the fifth game, at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in front of 92,706 fans.

By the end of [[1960 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1960]], after going 8\u201313, Koufax was thinking about quitting baseball to devote himself to an [[electronics]] business that he had invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to somebody else if Koufax did not return to play).<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 142\u2013147; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\n===Domination (1961\u20131964)===\n\n====1961 season====\n[[File:Sandy Koufax 1961.png|thumb|180px|Koufax in 1961.]]\nKoufax tried one more year of baseball and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years.

Teammate [[Ed Palmquist]] missed the flight, so Koufax was told he would need to pitch at least seven innings. In the first inning, Koufax walked the bases loaded on 12 straight pitches.

While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from [[Earl Francis]]. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger on his left hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and he was unable to complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers at the end of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 165\u2013176; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe night before the National League playoffs began, Manager [[Walter Alston]] asked Koufax if he could start the first game the next day. With an overworked pitching staff, there was no one else, as [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Johnny Podres]] had pitched the prior two days. Koufax obliged. Koufax later said, \"I had nothing at all.\" He was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to future Hall of Famer [[Willie Mays]] and [[Jim Davenport]]. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4\u20132 lead in the ninth inning of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 176\u2013177; [[#Neyer|Neyer]], pp. 111\u2013118.</ref>\n\n====1963 season====\nIn 1963, Major League Baseball expanded the [[strike zone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/strike_zone_rules_history.shtml|title=The Strike Zone: A Chronological Examination of the Official Rules by Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref> Compared to the previous season, National League walks fell 13 percent, strikeouts increased six percent, the league batting average fell from .261 to .245, and runs scored declined 15 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=1962 National League Team Statistics and Standings|website=Baseball-Reference|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1962.shtml|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}{{cite web|title=1963 National League Team Statistics and Standings|website=Baseball-Reference| url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> Koufax, who had reduced his walks allowed per nine innings to 3.4 in 1961 and 2.8 in 1962, reduced his walk rate further to 1.7 in 1963, which ranked fifth in the league.<ref name=\"bbref-skoufax\"/> The top pitchers of the era \u2013 [[Don Drysdale]], [[Juan Marichal]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Bob Gibson]], [[Warren Spahn]], and above all Koufax \u2013 significantly reduced the walks-given-up-to-batters-faced ratio for 1963, and subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/|title=Baseball Encyclopedia of MLB Players|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, Koufax [[No-hitter|no-hit]] the [[San Francisco Giants]] 8-0, besting future Hall of Fame pitcher [[Juan Marichal]]\u2014himself a no-hit pitcher a month later, on June 15.

Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games\u2014a resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with [[codeine]] for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning.

He is on the very short list of pitchers who retired with more career strikeouts than innings pitched. Koufax was selected as an All-Star for six consecutive seasons<ref name=\"baseballhall.org\"/> and made seven out of eight All-Star Game appearances those seasons (he was not selected for 2nd All-Star Game in 1962).<ref name=\"sportsdatallc.com\"/> He pitched 6{{frac|1|3}} innings in four All-Star games including being the starting pitcher for 3 innings in the 1966 All-Star Game.\n\nKoufax was the first pitcher to win multiple Cy Young Awards, as well as the first pitcher to win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were [[Don Newcombe]], the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and [[Don Drysdale]] in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote.<ref name=\"bbref-skoufax\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=MVP and Cy Young Awards|work=www.baseball-reference.com|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}</ref> Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.\n\nAmong NL pitchers with at least 2,000 innings pitched who have debuted since {{Baseball year|1913}} and have already retired, he has the highest career winning percentage (.655) and had the lowest career ERA (2.76) until surpassed by [[Tom Seaver]], whose NL career mark is 2.73. While Seaver ended his career with an overall career ERA of 2.86, this included three seasons in the American League. Seaver passed Koufax's mark in 1974 when he ended the season with more than 2,000 NL innings and an ERA of 2.47. Among retired pitchers, Koufax is currently second on the list of overall career ERA in the live-ball era, surpassed only by Whitey Ford (2.75).\n\nThrough 2010, among Jewish pitchers, he was first all-time in career strikeouts (ahead of [[Ken Holtzman]]), second in wins (behind Holtzman) and ERA (behind [[Barney Pelty]]), and seventh in games pitched (behind [[Alan Levine]]) among Jewish major league baseball players.<ref name=\"JML\">{{cite web|title=Career Pitching Leaders|url=http://www.jewishmajorleaguers.org/|work=Career Leaders|publisher=Jewish Major Leaguers|accessdate=February 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826042258/http://jewishmajorleaguers.org/|archive-date=August 26, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Pitching style==\n{{Quote box|width=20em|bgcolor=|align=right|quote=\"I knew every pitch he was going to throw and still I couldn't hit him.\"<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], p. 153; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 24.</ref>\n | source= \u2014[[Willie Mays]]}}\n\nWhereas many pitchers throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with a pronounced over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his [[velocity]], but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially movement away from left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches.<ref name=\"pitches\"/> His [[four-seam fastball]] gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin.<ref>[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 7\u20138, 79.</ref> It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand [[curveball]], spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24&nbsp;inches due to his arm action. [[Rob Neyer]] called it the best curve of all time.<ref>{{harvp|Neyer|James|2004|p=34}}</ref> He also occasionally threw a [[changeup]] and a [[forkball]].<ref name=\"pitches\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to \"tip\" pitches (i.e., reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind-up). Late in his career, and especially as his arm problems continued, this variation\u2014usually in the position he held his hands at the top of the wind-up\u2014became even more pronounced. Good hitters could often predict what pitch was coming, but were still unable to hit it.\n\n==Post-playing career==\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = LAret32.PNG\n|Name   = Sandy Koufax\n|Number = 32\n|Team   = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year   = 1972\n|}}\nIn 1967, Koufax signed a 10-year contract with [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] for US$1 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1|1967|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to be a broadcaster on the ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Saturday Game of the Week]]''.

When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate [[Joe Pignatano]] said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. [[Jackie Robinson]], in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage.

On May 15, the restriction on sending Koufax down to the minors was lifted. Alston gave him a chance to justify his place on the major league roster by giving him the next day's start. Facing the [[1957 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at [[Wrigley Field]], Koufax struck out 13 while pitching his first complete game in almost two years. For the first time in his career, he was in the starting rotation, but only for two weeks. Despite winning three of his next five with a 2.90 ERA, Koufax did not get another start for 45 days. In that start, he struck out 11 in seven innings, but got a no-decision.

While batting in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from [[Earl Francis]]. A numbness developed in Koufax's index finger on his left hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever, however, so he ignored the problem, hoping that the condition would clear up. By July, though, his entire hand was becoming numb and he was unable to complete some games. In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. A vascular specialist determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. But after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers at the end of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 165\u2013176; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 120\u2013121.</ref>\n\nThe night before the National League playoffs began, Manager [[Walter Alston]] asked Koufax if he could start the first game the next day. With an overworked pitching staff, there was no one else, as [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Johnny Podres]] had pitched the prior two days. Koufax obliged. Koufax later said, \"I had nothing at all.\" He was knocked out in the second inning, after giving up home runs to future Hall of Famer [[Willie Mays]] and [[Jim Davenport]]. After winning the second game of the series, the Dodgers blew a 4\u20132 lead in the ninth inning of the deciding third game, losing the pennant.<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], pp. 176\u2013177; [[#Neyer|Neyer]], pp. 111\u2013118.</ref>\n\n====1963 season====\nIn 1963, Major League Baseball expanded the [[strike zone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/strike_zone_rules_history.shtml|title=The Strike Zone: A Chronological Examination of the Official Rules by Baseball Almanac|publisher=Baseball-almanac.com|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref> Compared to the previous season, National League walks fell 13 percent, strikeouts increased six percent, the league batting average fell from .261 to .245, and runs scored declined 15 percent.<ref>{{cite web|title=1962 National League Team Statistics and Standings|website=Baseball-Reference|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1962.shtml|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}{{cite web|title=1963 National League Team Statistics and Standings|website=Baseball-Reference| url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/1963.shtml|accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref> Koufax, who had reduced his walks allowed per nine innings to 3.4 in 1961 and 2.8 in 1962, reduced his walk rate further to 1.7 in 1963, which ranked fifth in the league.<ref name=\"bbref-skoufax\"/> The top pitchers of the era \u2013 [[Don Drysdale]], [[Juan Marichal]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Bob Gibson]], [[Warren Spahn]], and above all Koufax \u2013 significantly reduced the walks-given-up-to-batters-faced ratio for 1963, and subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/|title=Baseball Encyclopedia of MLB Players|website=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=January 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, Koufax [[No-hitter|no-hit]] the [[San Francisco Giants]] 8-0, besting future Hall of Fame pitcher [[Juan Marichal]]\u2014himself a no-hit pitcher a month later, on June 15.

With the Series tied at 2 to 2, Koufax pitched a complete game shutout in Game 5 for a 3\u20132 Dodgers lead as the Series returned to [[Metropolitan Stadium|Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium]] for Game 6. The Twins won Game 6 to force a seventh game. Starting Game 7 on just two days of rest, Koufax pitched through fatigue and arthritic pain. Despite giving up on his curveball early in the game after failing to throw strikes with it in the first two innings and pitching the rest of the game relying almost entirely on fastballs, Koufax threw a three-hit shutout to clinch the Series. The performance earned him his second World Series MVP award. Koufax also won the [[Hickok Belt]] a second time, the first time anyone had won the belt more than once.

Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to get what they wanted. They demanded $1 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1|1966|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}), divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.167|1966|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) each for each of the next three seasons.

Instead, they both signed to appear in the movie ''[[Warning Shot (1967 film)|Warning Shot]]'', starring [[David Janssen]]. Drysdale was to play a TV commentator and Koufax a [[detective]]. Meanwhile, the Dodgers waged a [[public relations]] battle against them. After four weeks, Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals for both of them. Koufax ended up getting $125,000 and Drysdale $110,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.110|1966|r=2}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}).

Since then, no left-hander has had more wins, nor a lower ERA, in a season (Phillies pitcher [[Steve Carlton]] did match the 27-win mark in 1972).

He is on the very short list of pitchers who retired with more career strikeouts than innings pitched. Koufax was selected as an All-Star for six consecutive seasons<ref name=\"baseballhall.org\"/> and made seven out of eight All-Star Game appearances those seasons (he was not selected for 2nd All-Star Game in 1962).<ref name=\"sportsdatallc.com\"/> He pitched 6{{frac|1|3}} innings in four All-Star games including being the starting pitcher for 3 innings in the 1966 All-Star Game.\n\nKoufax was the first pitcher to win multiple Cy Young Awards, as well as the first pitcher to win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only pitcher to win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were [[Don Newcombe]], the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and [[Don Drysdale]] in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote.<ref name=\"bbref-skoufax\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=MVP and Cy Young Awards|work=www.baseball-reference.com|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}</ref> Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.\n\nAmong NL pitchers with at least 2,000 innings pitched who have debuted since {{Baseball year|1913}} and have already retired, he has the highest career winning percentage (.655) and had the lowest career ERA (2.76) until surpassed by [[Tom Seaver]], whose NL career mark is 2.73. While Seaver ended his career with an overall career ERA of 2.86, this included three seasons in the American League. Seaver passed Koufax's mark in 1974 when he ended the season with more than 2,000 NL innings and an ERA of 2.47. Among retired pitchers, Koufax is currently second on the list of overall career ERA in the live-ball era, surpassed only by Whitey Ford (2.75).\n\nThrough 2010, among Jewish pitchers, he was first all-time in career strikeouts (ahead of [[Ken Holtzman]]), second in wins (behind Holtzman) and ERA (behind [[Barney Pelty]]), and seventh in games pitched (behind [[Alan Levine]]) among Jewish major league baseball players.<ref name=\"JML\">{{cite web|title=Career Pitching Leaders|url=http://www.jewishmajorleaguers.org/|work=Career Leaders|publisher=Jewish Major Leaguers|accessdate=February 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826042258/http://jewishmajorleaguers.org/|archive-date=August 26, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Pitching style==\n{{Quote box|width=20em|bgcolor=|align=right|quote=\"I knew every pitch he was going to throw and still I couldn't hit him.\"<ref>[[#Koufax and Linn|Koufax and Linn]], p. 153; [[#Leavy|Leavy]], p. 24.</ref>\n | source= \u2014[[Willie Mays]]}}\n\nWhereas many pitchers throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with a pronounced over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his [[velocity]], but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially movement away from left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking wind-up and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches.<ref name=\"pitches\"/> His [[four-seam fastball]] gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin.<ref>[[#Leavy|Leavy]], pp. 7\u20138, 79.</ref> It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand [[curveball]], spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24&nbsp;inches due to his arm action. [[Rob Neyer]] called it the best curve of all time.<ref>{{harvp|Neyer|James|2004|p=34}}</ref> He also occasionally threw a [[changeup]] and a [[forkball]].<ref name=\"pitches\"/>\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to \"tip\" pitches (i.e., reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind-up). Late in his career, and especially as his arm problems continued, this variation\u2014usually in the position he held his hands at the top of the wind-up\u2014became even more pronounced. Good hitters could often predict what pitch was coming, but were still unable to hit it.\n\n==Post-playing career==\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = LAret32.PNG\n|Name   = Sandy Koufax\n|Number = 32\n|Team   = Los Angeles Dodgers\n|Year   = 1972\n|}}\nIn 1967, Koufax signed a 10-year contract with [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] for US$1 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|1|1967|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation/year|US}}) to be a broadcaster on the ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Saturday Game of the Week]]''.

The majority of those inhabiting the region were engaged in traditional industries such as coir, cashew, brick-making and fishing. Any attempt to develop the inland waterways will favourably impact the well-being of these people.\n\nIn pre-independence era especially transportation across Kerala was mainly through boats. Road networks in state were quite insufficient. Howevere later when roadways and railways started to develop the importance of waterways started to diminish.

Other names for the ethnic group include '''Black Caribbean''', '''Afro-''' or '''Black West Indian''', or '''Afro-''' or '''Black''' '''Antillean'''. The term Afro-Caribbean was not coined by [[West Indian]]s themselves but was first used by Americans in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Committee on Foreign Affairs|first1=United States Congress House|title=Hearings|date=1970|volume=2|pages=64\u201369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yj8gAAAAMAAJ&q=Afro-+Caribbean}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Afro-Caribbean descent today mainly have between 85\u201395% African ancestry with their remaining DNA being of non-African ancestry, such as European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Amerindian descent, as there has been extensive intermarriage and unions among the peoples over the centuries.  \nAlthough most Afro-Caribbean people today live in [[French language|French]]-, [[English language|English]]-, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking Caribbean nations and territories, there are also significant diaspora populations throughout the [[Western world]]\u2014especially in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Both the home and diaspora populations have produced a number of individuals who have had a notable influence on modern Western, Caribbean, and African societies; they include political activists such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[C. L. R. James]]; writers and theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]]; US military leader and statesman [[Colin Powell]]; and musicians [[Bob Marley]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Rihanna]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Afro-Caribbean history}}\n\n===16th\u201318th centuries===\nDuring the post-Columbian era, the archipelagos and islands of the [[Caribbean]] were the first sites of [[African diaspora]] dispersal in the western Atlantic. Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], an African-Spanish seafarer, was recorded as piloting one of Columbus' ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes arriving as free men of mixed ancestry or as indentured servants, but increasingly as [[Slavery in the Americas|enslaved]] workers and servants. This increasing demand for African labour in the Caribbean was in part the result of massive depopulation of the native [[Taino]] and other indigenous peoples caused by the new [[infectious diseases]], harsh conditions, and warfare brought by European colonists. By the mid-16th century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] from [[West Africa]] to the Caribbean was so profitable that [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] were prepared to engage in piracy as well as break Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[San Domingo]] (modern-day [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).<ref>{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ| ''Some Historical Account of Guinea: With an Inquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Slave Trade|page=48}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonial development in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery to cultivate and process the lucrative commodity crop of [[sugarcane]]. On many islands shortly before the end of the 18th century, the enslaved Afro-Caribbeans greatly outnumbered their European masters. In addition, there developed a class of [[free people of color]], especially in the French islands, where persons of mixed race were given certain rights.<ref>Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on \"records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas\". {{cite book |last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi }}</ref> On [[Saint-Domingue]], free people of color and slaves rebelled against harsh conditions, and constant inter-imperial warfare. Inspired by French revolutionary sentiments that at one point freed the slaves, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] led the [[Haitian Revolution]] that gained the independence of [[Haiti]] in 1804, the first Afro-Caribbean republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n===19th\u201320th centuries===\nIn 1804, Haiti, with its overwhelmingly African population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state. During the 19th century, continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]], led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region by various colonial powers. Great Britain abolished slavery in its holdings in 1834. [[Cuba]] was the last island to be emancipated, when Spain abolished slavery in its colonies.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people, who were a majority in many Caribbean societies, began to assert their cultural, economic, and political rights with more vigor on the world stage. [[Marcus Garvey]] was among many influential immigrants to the United States from Jamaica, expanding his [[UNIA]] movement in [[New York City]] and the U.S.<ref>Martin, Tony. ''Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggle of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976.</ref>  Afro-Caribbeans were influential in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] as artists and writers. [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] developed a [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement.\n\nIn the 1960s, the West Indian territories were given their political independence from [[British Empire|British colonial rule]]. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[reggae music]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a developing Afro-Caribbean diaspora in the United States, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]], was influential in the development of the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and the [[hip-hop]] movement of the 1980s. African-Caribbean individuals also contributed to cultural developments in Europe, as evidenced by influential theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]]<ref>Nigel C.

Caribbean''' are [[Caribbean people]] who trace their full or partial ancestry to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. They form the dominant racial group in the region. \n\nMajority of the modern Afro-Caribbeans descend from slaves taken to [[History of the Caribbean|colonial Caribbean]] via the [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]] between the 15th and 19th centuries to work primarily on various [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]]s and in domestic households. Other names for the ethnic group include '''Black Caribbean''', '''Afro-''' or '''Black West Indian''', or '''Afro-''' or '''Black''' '''Antillean'''. The term Afro-Caribbean was not coined by [[West Indian]]s themselves but was first used by Americans in the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Committee on Foreign Affairs|first1=United States Congress House|title=Hearings|date=1970|volume=2|pages=64\u201369|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yj8gAAAAMAAJ&q=Afro-+Caribbean}}</ref>\n\nPeople of Afro-Caribbean descent today mainly have between 85\u201395% African ancestry with their remaining DNA being of non-African ancestry, such as European, South Asian, Middle Eastern, and Amerindian descent, as there has been extensive intermarriage and unions among the peoples over the centuries.  \nAlthough most Afro-Caribbean people today live in [[French language|French]]-, [[English language|English]]-, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking Caribbean nations and territories, there are also significant diaspora populations throughout the [[Western world]]\u2014especially in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]]. Both the home and diaspora populations have produced a number of individuals who have had a notable influence on modern Western, Caribbean, and African societies; they include political activists such as [[Marcus Garvey]] and [[C. L. R. James]]; writers and theorists such as [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] and [[Frantz Fanon]]; US military leader and statesman [[Colin Powell]]; and musicians [[Bob Marley]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Rihanna]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Afro-Caribbean history}}\n\n===16th\u201318th centuries===\nDuring the post-Columbian era, the archipelagos and islands of the [[Caribbean]] were the first sites of [[African diaspora]] dispersal in the western Atlantic. Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], an African-Spanish seafarer, was recorded as piloting one of Columbus' ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes arriving as free men of mixed ancestry or as indentured servants, but increasingly as [[Slavery in the Americas|enslaved]] workers and servants. This increasing demand for African labour in the Caribbean was in part the result of massive depopulation of the native [[Taino]] and other indigenous peoples caused by the new [[infectious diseases]], harsh conditions, and warfare brought by European colonists. By the mid-16th century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] from [[West Africa]] to the Caribbean was so profitable that [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] were prepared to engage in piracy as well as break Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[San Domingo]] (modern-day [[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).<ref>{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ| ''Some Historical Account of Guinea: With an Inquiry into the Rise and Progress of the Slave Trade|page=48}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonial development in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery to cultivate and process the lucrative commodity crop of [[sugarcane]]. On many islands shortly before the end of the 18th century, the enslaved Afro-Caribbeans greatly outnumbered their European masters. In addition, there developed a class of [[free people of color]], especially in the French islands, where persons of mixed race were given certain rights.<ref>Stephen D. Behrendt, David Richardson, and David Eltis, [[W. E. B. Du Bois Institute|W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research]], [[Harvard University]]. Based on \"records for 27,233 voyages that set out to obtain slaves for the Americas\". {{cite book |last=Stephen Behrendt |title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-465-00071-5 |chapter=Transatlantic Slave Trade |quote= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/africanaencyclop00appi }}</ref> On [[Saint-Domingue]], free people of color and slaves rebelled against harsh conditions, and constant inter-imperial warfare. Inspired by French revolutionary sentiments that at one point freed the slaves, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] and [[Jean Jacques Dessalines]] led the [[Haitian Revolution]] that gained the independence of [[Haiti]] in 1804, the first Afro-Caribbean republic in the [[Western Hemisphere]].\n\n===19th\u201320th centuries===\nIn 1804, Haiti, with its overwhelmingly African population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state. During the 19th century, continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]], led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in Jamaica, created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region by various colonial powers. Great Britain abolished slavery in its holdings in 1834. [[Cuba]] was the last island to be emancipated, when Spain abolished slavery in its colonies.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people, who were a majority in many Caribbean societies, began to assert their cultural, economic, and political rights with more vigor on the world stage. [[Marcus Garvey]] was among many influential immigrants to the United States from Jamaica, expanding his [[UNIA]] movement in [[New York City]] and the U.S.<ref>Martin, Tony. ''Race First: The Ideological and Organizational Struggle of Marcus Garvey and the Universal Negro Improvement Association''. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1976.</ref>  Afro-Caribbeans were influential in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] as artists and writers. [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]] developed a [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement.\n\nIn the 1960s, the West Indian territories were given their political independence from [[British Empire|British colonial rule]]. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[reggae music]], [[Calypso music|calypso]] and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a developing Afro-Caribbean diaspora in the United States, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]], was influential in the development of the [[Black Power]] movement of the 1960s and the [[hip-hop]] movement of the 1980s. African-Caribbean individuals also contributed to cultural developments in Europe, as evidenced by influential theorists such as [[Frantz Fanon]]<ref>Nigel C.

It has a variety of functional uses in programming and other contexts.\n\nThe keyboard symbol {{keypress|^}} has two meanings: used stand-alone it is a caret, used as a combining [[diacritic]] (as in <code>\u0175</code>) it is a [[circumflex]] accent.{{efn|For information on how to create characters like \u0175, see [[Circumflex]].}} \n\nThe caret is not to be confused with other chevron-shaped characters, such as the circumflex accent, the [[turned v]] or the [[Logical operator|logical AND]], which may occasionally be called carets.<ref name=\"Unicode IPA Extensions\"/><ref name=\"Weisstein\"/>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Proofreading mark===\n\nThe caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a [[proofreading]] mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document.<ref name=\"MLA\" /> The term comes from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|caret}}, \"it lacks\", from {{lang|la|car\u0113re}}, \"to lack; to be separated from; to be free from\".<ref name=\"Merriam-Webster\" /> The caret symbol is written below the line of text for a line-level punctuation mark, such as a [[comma]], or above the line as an inverted caret ([[cf.]] {{unichar|02C7|caron|nlink=}}) for a higher character, such as an [[apostrophe]];<ref name=\"APA\"/> the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"300px\">\nFile:Image of carets telling reader to insert a comma, an apostrophe, and quotation marks.png|Carets telling reader to insert a comma, an apostrophe, and quotation marks\nFile:Image of caret telling a reader to insert a letter.png|Caret telling a reader to insert a letter\nFile:Image of caret telling reader to insert a word.png|Caret telling reader to insert a word\nFile:Image of caret telling reader to change a word.png|Caret telling reader to change a word\n</gallery>\n\n===Programming languages===\n\nThe caret has many uses in [[programming language]]s. It can signify exponentiation, the bitwise [[XOR]] operator, [[string concatenation]], and [[control character]]s in [[caret notation]], among other uses. In [[regular expression]]s, the caret is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched.\n\n[[ANSI C]] can transcribe the caret in the form of the [[C trigraph|trigraph]] <code>??'</code>, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. \n[[C++]] additionally supports tokens like <code>xor</code> (for <code>^</code>) and <code>xor_eq</code> (for <code>^=</code>) to avoid the character altogether. \n[[RFC 1345]] recommends to transcribe the character as [[Digraph (computing)|digraph]] <code>'></code> when required.<ref name=\"RFC1345\">[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345 RFC 1345]</ref>\n\n[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] uses the caret for declaring and dereferencing [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s. \nIn [[Smalltalk]], the caret is the method return statement.\nIn [[C++/CLI]], .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the <code>ClassName^</code> syntax.\nIn Apple's [[Blocks (C language extension)|C extensions]] for Mac OS X and iOS, carets are used to create [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] and to denote block types.\n[[Go (programming language)|Go]] uses it as a [[bitwise NOT]] operator.\n\n[[Node.js]] uses the caret in [[Manifest file|package.json]] files to signify dependency resolution behavior being used for each particular dependency. In the case of Node.js, a caret allows any kind of update, unless it is seen as a \"major\" update as defined by [[semver]]. <ref>[https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004 Caret ranges in node.js]</ref>\n\n===Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation===\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the caret can signify [[exponentiation]] (<code>3^5</code> for {{math|3<sup>5</sup>}}), where the usual [[Subscript and superscript|superscript]] is not readily usable (as on some [[graphing calculator]]s). The caret is also now used to indicate a superscript in [[TeX]] typesetting. As [[Isaac Asimov]] described it in his 1974 \"''Skewered!''\" essay (on [[Skewes' number]]), \"I make the exponent a figure of normal size and it is as though it is being held up by a lever, and its added weight when its size grows bends the lever down.\"<ref name=\"Asimov\" /> The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to [[ALGOL 60]],{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used as a form of [[Tetration|iterated exponentiation]] in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].\n\n===Escape character===\n\nThe command-line interpreter, [[cmd.exe]], of Windows family of operating systems uses the caret (^) to [[escape character|escape]] reserved characters.\n\n;Example:\n <source lang=\"doscon\" inline>C:\\>ECHO Show greater than: ^> pipe: ^| less than: ^< caret: ^^ and  ^%TMP^% and ^&</source>\n Show greater than: > pipe: | less than: < caret: ^ and  %TMP% and &\n\n===Ordinal indicator===\n\nIn Italian, the caret is sometimes used in a similar manner to the [[ordinal indicator]], most noticeably on tickets from [[Trenitalia]], the primary operator of trains within Italy, and [[Rome|Rome's]] ATAC public transit system.  On Trenitalia tickets, the [[travel class]] is often written as 1^ or 2^, meaning [[First class travel|first class]] or second class respectively. This is due to the lack of the feminine [[Ordinal indicator#Galician, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish|ordinal indicator (<sup>\u2212a</sup>)]] used in Italian in the ASCII set (the masculine ordinal indicator is usually replaced by the [[degree sign]] when extended characters are not available or in less accurate typesetting).\n\n===Signature tag===\nIn [[social network service]]s such as [[Twitter]], a caret placed before a word is used to tag that word as an individual's signature within a group account thus differentiating an individual's contribution from a group-authored contribution.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Upwards-pointing arrow===\n\nIn [[internet forum]]s, [[social networking sites]] such as Facebook, or in [[online chat]]s, a caret or a series of carets may be used beneath or after the post of one user by another user. In this usage, the caret ^ represents an upwards-pointing arrow meaning for readers, [[Posting style|post]]ers or the [[original post]] (OP) to see the above line/post,<ref name=\"Computer Hope\" /> and in addition to the arrow usage, can also mean that the user who posted the ^ agrees with the above post. Multiple carets may indicate the comment is replying to or relating to the post above that correlates with the number of carets used, or may simply be used for emphasis.\n\nA similar use has been adopted by programming language [[compiler]]s such as Java compiler to point out where a [[compilation error]] has occurred. In addition to indicating the line number and column number of the error location, the compiler prints out the faulty line of code and uses a single caret on the next line, padded by spaces, to give a visual indication of the error location. The caret acts as an upwards-pointing arrow in the text-based print out of the error details.\n\n===Estimator===\nIn statistics or other forms of estimation, [[estimator]]s of a parameter or dependent variable can be shown by use of a caret or hat symbol above the symbol for that parameter or dependent variable. For example, with observations of independent variable data <math>x_i</math> and dependent variable data <math>y_i</math>, and assuming a model of <math>y_i = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_i+\\varepsilon_i</math>, [[simple linear regression]] can lead to an estimated model of the form <math>\\hat{y}_i = \\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i</math> where <math>\\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2</math> is minimised by finding optimal values of <math>\\hat{\\beta}_0</math> and <math>\\hat{\\beta}_1</math> for the observed data.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite book | title = Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association | edition = 5th | year = 2001 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 1-55798-791-2 | page = [https://archive.org/details/publicationmanu000amer/page/338 338] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/publicationmanu000amer }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Asimov\">[[Isaac Asimov]] (1974), \"Skewered\", ''Of Matters Great and Small'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], {{ISBN|978-0385022255}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Computer Hope\">{{cite web | title = What is Caret? | url = http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/caret.htm | publisher = [[Computer Hope]]| accessdate = 14 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Jennings\">{{cite web | url = http://www.worldpowersystems.com/projects/codes/index.html#UP | title = ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Infiltration | author = Tom Jennings | accessdate = 14 September 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140821121342/http://www.worldpowersystems.com/projects/codes/index.html#UP | archive-date = 21 August 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Korpela\">{{cite web| url = http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/kirjaimet/tarinoita.pdf | title = Kirjainten tarinoita | author = Jukka K.

It has a variety of functional uses in programming and other contexts.\n\nThe keyboard symbol {{keypress|^}} has two meanings: used stand-alone it is a caret, as a combining [[diacritic]] (as in <code>\u0175</code>) it is a [[circumflex]] accent.{{efn|For information on how to create characters like \u0175, see [[Circumflex]].}} \n\nThe caret is not to be confused with other chevron-shaped characters, such as the circumflex accent, the [[turned v]] or the [[Logical operator|logical AND]], which may occasionally be called carets.<ref name=\"Unicode IPA Extensions\"/><ref name=\"Weisstein\"/>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Proofreading mark===\n\nThe caret was originally and continues to be used in handwritten form as a [[proofreading]] mark to indicate where a punctuation mark, word, or phrase should be inserted into a document.<ref name=\"MLA\" /> The term comes from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|caret}}, \"it lacks\", from {{lang|la|car\u0113re}}, \"to lack; to be separated from; to be free from\".<ref name=\"Merriam-Webster\" /> The caret symbol is written below the line of text for a line-level punctuation mark, such as a [[comma]], or above the line as an inverted caret ([[cf.]] {{unichar|02C7|caron|nlink=}}) for a higher character, such as an [[apostrophe]];<ref name=\"APA\"/> the material to be inserted may be placed inside the caret, in the margin, or above the line.\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"300px\">\nFile:Image of carets telling reader to insert a comma, an apostrophe, and quotation marks.png|Carets telling reader to insert a comma, an apostrophe, and quotation marks\nFile:Image of caret telling a reader to insert a letter.png|Caret telling a reader to insert a letter\nFile:Image of caret telling reader to insert a word.png|Caret telling reader to insert a word\nFile:Image of caret telling reader to change a word.png|Caret telling reader to change a word\n</gallery>\n\n===Programming languages===\n\nThe caret has many uses in [[programming language]]s. It can signify exponentiation, the bitwise [[XOR]] operator, [[string concatenation]], and [[control character]]s in [[caret notation]], among other uses. In [[regular expression]]s, the caret is used to match the beginning of a string or line; if it begins a character class, then the inverse of the class is to be matched.\n\n[[ANSI C]] can transcribe the caret in the form of the [[C trigraph|trigraph]] <code>??'</code>, as the character was originally not available in all character sets and keyboards. \n[[C++]] additionally supports tokens like <code>xor</code> (for <code>^</code>) and <code>xor_eq</code> (for <code>^=</code>) to avoid the character altogether. \n[[RFC 1345]] recommends to transcribe the character as [[Digraph (computing)|digraph]] <code>'></code> when required.<ref name=\"RFC1345\">[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1345 RFC 1345]</ref>\n\n[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] uses the caret for declaring and dereferencing [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s. \nIn [[Smalltalk]], the caret is the method return statement.\nIn [[C++/CLI]], .NET reference types are accessed through a handle using the <code>ClassName^</code> syntax.\nIn Apple's [[Blocks (C language extension)|C extensions]] for Mac OS X and iOS, carets are used to create [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]] and to denote block types.\n[[Go (programming language)|Go]] uses it as a [[bitwise NOT]] operator.\n\n[[Node.js]] uses the caret in [[Manifest file|package.json]] files to signify dependency resolution behavior being used for each particular dependency. In the case of Node.js, a caret allows any kind of update, unless it is seen as a \"major\" update as defined by [[semver]]. <ref>[https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#caret-ranges-123-025-004 Caret ranges in node.js]</ref>\n\n===Surrogate symbol for superscript and exponentiation===\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the caret can signify [[exponentiation]] (<code>3^5</code> for {{math|3<sup>5</sup>}}), where the usual [[Subscript and superscript|superscript]] is not readily usable (as on some [[graphing calculator]]s). The caret is also now used to indicate a superscript in [[TeX]] typesetting. As [[Isaac Asimov]] described it in his 1974 \"''Skewered!''\" essay (on [[Skewes' number]]), \"I make the exponent a figure of normal size and it is as though it is being held up by a lever, and its added weight when its size grows bends the lever down.\"<ref name=\"Asimov\" /> The use of the caret for exponentiation can be traced back to [[ALGOL 60]],{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} which expressed the exponentiation operator as an upward-pointing arrow, intended to evoke the superscript notation common in mathematics. The upward-pointing arrow is now used as a form of [[Tetration|iterated exponentiation]] in [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]].\n\n===Escape character===\n\nThe command-line interpreter, [[cmd.exe]], of Windows family of operating systems uses the caret (^) to [[escape character|escape]] reserved characters.\n\n;Example:\n <source lang=\"doscon\" inline>C:\\>ECHO Show greater than: ^> pipe: ^| less than: ^< caret: ^^ and  ^%TMP^% and ^&</source>\n Show greater than: > pipe: | less than: < caret: ^ and  %TMP% and &\n\n===Ordinal indicator===\n\nIn Italian, the caret is sometimes used in a similar manner to the [[ordinal indicator]], most noticeably on tickets from [[Trenitalia]], the primary operator of trains within Italy, and [[Rome|Rome's]] ATAC public transit system.

It was spoken approximately until the rise to power of [[Prussia]] in mid-18th century, when it was superseded by [[Low German]].\n\nBy the 18th century, [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] Polabian was in some respects markedly different from other [[Slavic languages]], most notably in having a strong [[German language|German]] influence.

for example, [[Wustrow, Lower Saxony|Wustrow]] (way to the island or place on the island), [[L\u00fcchow|Ljauch\u00f3w (L\u00fcchow)]], [[Luckau (Wendland)|\u0141uk\u00f3w (Luckau)]], compare [[Lucknow|Luknow (Lucknow)]] in [[\u0100ry\u0101varta]], [[Sagard]], [[Gartow]], [[Krakow am See|Krakow]] (resembling [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Krakov (Rakovn\u00edk District)|Krakov]]\u2026) etc. Polabian language is also a likely origin of the name [[wikt:Berlin|Berlin]], from the Polabian stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' (swamp).\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Phonology===\nFor Polabian the following segments are reconstructable:<ref>Cited after {{harvtxt|Kazimierz |1993|p=799}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Oral non-reduced monophthongs\n|{{IPA|i&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;y&nbsp;}}\n|\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;u}}\n|-\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;e&nbsp;}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u025b&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u0153&nbsp;}}\n|\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u0254&nbsp;}}\n|-\n|\n|\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;a&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u0252&nbsp;}}\n|}\n\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Reduced\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u0259&nbsp;}}\n|-\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;\u0250&nbsp;}}\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Diphthongs\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;ai&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u0252i&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;oi&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;au&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u0252u&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=1em}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Nasal\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u00e3&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|{{IPA|&nbsp;&nbsp;\u0254\u0303&nbsp;&nbsp;}}\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Polabian consonant segments\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\"|\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=\"1\"|[[dental consonant|Dental]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!colspan=\"1\"|[[palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!colspan=\"1\"|[[palatal consonant|Post-<br />palatal]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[plosive consonant|Plosives]]\n| align=center | {{IPA|p}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|p\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|t}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|t\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|k}}\n|-\n| align=center | {{IPA|b}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|b\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|d}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|d\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|\u0261}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[affricate consonant|Affricates]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|t\u0361s}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|t\u0361s\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|d\u0361z}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|d\u0361z\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[fricative consonant|Fricatives]]\n| align=center | {{IPA|f}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|s}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|\u0283}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|s\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|x\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|x}}\n|-\n| align=center | {{IPA|v}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|v\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|z}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|z\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" |[[Nasal stop|Nasals]]\n| align=center | {{IPA|m}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|m\u02b2}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|n}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|n\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" |[[lateral consonant|Laterals]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|l}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|l\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" |[[trill consonant|Trills]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|r}}\n| align=center | {{IPA|r\u02b2}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|-\n!colspan=\"1\"|[[Semi-vowel]]\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n| align=center | {{IPA|j}}\n| align=center |\n| align=center |\n|}\n\n==Example of Polabian==\nThe ''[[Lord's Prayer]]'' in Polabian and related [[Lechitic languages]], compared to [[Old Church Slavonic]], German and English:<ref>Polabian version quoted after [http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/didact/idg/slav/polabbs.htm#EN3 TITUS project]</ref> Germanic loanwords, which are comparatively rare in the other [[West Slavic languages]], are highlighted in '''bold''' (loanwords in Germanic versions are highlighted as well).\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:left;
