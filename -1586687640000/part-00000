In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, at a level of dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.<ref name=Aust1977 />\n\nThe position of the [[Australian Medical Association]] is that \"evidence-based aspects of complementary medicine can be part of patient care by a medical practitioner\", but it has concerns that there is \"limited efficacy evidence regarding most complementary medicine.

In 1910, the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] published the [[Flexner Report]], which criticized many aspects of medical education, especially quality and lack of scientific rigour. The advent of [[penicillin]] and other \"miracle drugs\" and the consequent popularity of modern medicine also contributed to naturopathy's decline.

In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, at a level of dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.<ref name=Aust1977 />\n\nThe position of the [[Australian Medical Association]] is that \"evidence-based aspects of complementary medicine can be part of patient care by a medical practitioner\", but it has concerns that there is \"limited efficacy evidence regarding most complementary medicine. Unproven complementary medicines and therapies can pose a risk to patient health either directly through misuse or indirectly if a patient defers seeking medical advice.\" The AMA's position on regulation is that \"there should be appropriate regulation of complementary medicine practitioners and their activities.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ama.com.au/position-statement/complementary-medicine-2012 |title=AMA Position Statement: Complementary Medicine - 2012 |date=28 August 2012 |publisher=Australian Medical Association |accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the Australian government found no clear evidence of effectiveness for naturopathy.<ref name=aus17/> Accordingly, In 2017 the Australian government named Naturopathy as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\".<ref name=nosubsidy>{{cite journal |title=Homeopathy, naturopathy struck off private insurance list |author=Paola S |date=17 October 2017 |journal=Australian Journal of Pharmacy |url=https://ajp.com.au/news/homeopathy-naturopathy-struck-off-private-insurance-list/}}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\nIn India, naturopathy is overseen by the [[Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy]] (AYUSH); there is a 5\u00bd-year degree in \"Bachelor of Naturopathy and Yogic Sciences\" (BNYS) degree that was offered by  twelve colleges in India {{as of|2010|August|lc=y}}.<ref name=ayush1>Ministry of AYUSH.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae.

The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as [[monotremes]] have to mammals.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct.

One possibility is they dispersed through [[vicariance]], whereby therizinosaurs were present in the areas that became Asia and North America before the [[rifting]] that divided these areas in the [[Late Triassic]]. The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle [[Barremian]]; between 132\u2013138&nbsp;million years ago, a temporary [[land bridge]] connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs ''Beipiaosaurus'' from Asia and ''Falcarius'' from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid ''Nothronychus'', which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the [[Turonian]] stage of the early [[Late Cretaceous]] also shows there would have been a [[faunal interchange]] between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the [[Aptian]]/[[Albian]]), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Therizinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeletons of the North American therizinosaurs ''[[Nothronychus]]'' (large) and ''[[Falcarius]]'', in modern, bipedal postures, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]\n\nIn 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been [[Semiaquatic|amphibious]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |last2=Perle |first2=A. |author2-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Modiphikatsiy tasa sayrisziy i parallelinoe rasvitie zishchnich dinosavrov |trans-title=Modification in the saurischian pelvis and the parallel development of predatory dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=8 |pages=39\u201344|language=Russian|translator-last=Welsh |translator-first=W.

In 1970, [[Anatoly K.

Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities)]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the [[Galbin]] region of the Gobi Desert.<ref name=\"Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Perle |first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Segnosauridae \u2013 novoe semeistvo teropod is posdnego mela Mongolii |trans-title=Segnosauridae \u2013 a new family of Theropoda from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |language=Russian |volume=8 |pages=45\u201355 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128221548/http://paleoglot.org/files/Perle%2079.pdf |archive-date=2012-11-28 |translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]]]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives.

The other possibility is that basal therizinosaurs dispersed between Asia and North America via Europe after the rifting event but before the middle [[Barremian]]; between 132\u2013138&nbsp;million years ago, a temporary [[land bridge]] connected North America and Europe, whereafter the landmasses were again isolated from each other, explaining why the basal therizinosaurs ''Beipiaosaurus'' from Asia and ''Falcarius'' from North America were so morphologically divergent from each other, though coeval. The presence of the derived therizinosaurid ''Nothronychus'', which was most-closely related to Asian genera, in North America during the [[Turonian]] stage of the early [[Late Cretaceous]] also shows there would have been a [[faunal interchange]] between North America and Asia via a late-Early Cretaceous land bridge before that (during the [[Aptian]]/[[Albian]]), which is also seen in some other dinosaur groups.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\n==Paleobiology==\n[[File:Therizinosaurs.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed skeletons of the North American therizinosaurs ''[[Nothronychus]]'' (large) and ''[[Falcarius]]'', in modern, bipedal postures, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]]\n\nIn 1979 and 1981, Barsbold and Perle said the short, massive metatarsus and unusually large, splayed toes indicated that ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives were not adapted for rapid locomotion, perhaps because it was not required by their lifestyle; Barsbold and Perle suggested they could have been [[Semiaquatic|amphibious]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |last2=Perle |first2=A. |author2-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1979 |title=Modiphikatsiy tasa sayrisziy i parallelinoe rasvitie zishchnich dinosavrov |trans-title=Modification in the saurischian pelvis and the parallel development of predatory dinosaurs |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=8 |pages=39\u201344|language=Russian|translator-last=Welsh |translator-first=W.

Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

''Segnosaurus'', along with [[diplodocoid]] and titanosaur sauropods, deinocheirid and ornithomimid ornithomimosaurs, and [[caenagnathids]], was found to be in the former category, whereas ''Erlikosaurus'' was more similar to some sauropodomorph and ornithischian taxa, indicating these two therizinosaurs were functionally separated and occupied different niches.<ref name=\"DivergentHerbivory\">{{cite journal |last1=Button |first1=D.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

An architect by profession, he graduated from Sri Ara Schools, Malaysia.\n\n==Biography==\n===Birth===\nAli was born on September 11, 1977. According to sources, there was no electricity in the entire city of [[Lahore]] that night; as such, Ali was born with lanterns placed in the maternity ward.\n\n===Childhood===\nAli comes from a family involved with showbiz. His cousin, Bilal Maqsood, son of veteran comedian and writer Anwer Maqsood, was a frequent visitor at the residential apartment complex where Ali resided for most of his childhood and teen years. Ali was famed for having the largest collection of music cassettes in the entire neighborhood. He was strumming the guitar very early on in his life. Many joked that Ali was taking after Bilal, the latter being a successful guitar lead for the popular band Strings and a student at Indus Valley School of Art in the 1990s.\n\n===Ganda Banda and the 3 Dead Cats===\n'Ganda Banda & the 3 Dead Cats' was formed while studying in Indus. Ali along with his friends Babar Sheikh, Ahmed and Rizwan started performing in local events and restaurants. They became popular in the underground circuit with more than 100 shows to their record. \nThe Band recorded a rough-cut live studio version in Sonic Studios Karachi. The album was titled 'Live! 2.5&nbsp;km from the Tower'. It was later released online in 2006 on the website Raw.com.pk\nThe band disbanded in 2004 with bitter creative indifferences, vowed never to get back again. Their departure was marked by a farewell video 'Tu Na Ho Meray Paas' directed by Umair Tareen, of Razam fame.\n\nAccording to Babar Sheikh, ex-band member, Ali was always the main brain of Ganda Banda & The 3D Cats. Songs like 'Tu Na Ho Meray Pass' and 'Dhoondha Taaron Mein' that have achieved \"cult\" status today were all Ali's creations.\n\n===Ali Alam and his solo years===\nAfter Ganda Banda, Ali tried to go solo by recording 'Raat Jaagi' in [[Mekaal Hasan]]'s [[Digital Fidelity Studios]] in [[Lahore]]. The track also featured Gumby on drums. The track was released online and became popular through many music websites. A low-budget video of the track was shot & directed by Bilal Maqsood. The video was highly successful and went to no.6 on the MTV Indian charts on Indus Music.\n\nTo make ends meet, Ali recorded 'Kachwa Bachao' for an animal foundation.
