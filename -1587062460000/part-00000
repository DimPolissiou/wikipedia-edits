It spanned three issues each of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #225-227, ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #24-26, and ''[[New Mutants]]''  #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo.\n\nThe 1990 computer game ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' was based on this storyline.\n\n==Promotion==\n[[Image:Mutant Reg Ad.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The faux-advertisement for the Mutant Registration Act. The \"mutie\" is [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Art by [[Jon Bogdanove]].]] Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \"[[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] menace\" and [[Senator Robert Kelly]]'s proposed [[Mutant Registration Act]], which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \"[[Days of Future Past]]\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles [[cover date]]d \"November 1987\". Asking \"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government.\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Fall of the Mutants'' consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants.\n\n===Uncanny X-Men===\nThe [[X-Men]] head to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in search of their missing and de-powered leader [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], herself seeking the mutant inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]], a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant [[precognition|precognitive]] [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing \u2014 in Texas, in the middle of summer \u2014 and as [[caveman|cavemen]], dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city.  Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter [[Neal Conan]] and cameraman [[Manoli Wetherell]], who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force.\n\nStorm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers),<ref>'' The Uncanny X-Men'' #185\u2013186</ref> spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools \u2014 and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg \u2014 enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas.\n\nTime and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the [[Vietnam War]]. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naivet\u00e9, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in.\n\nAs Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified [[Kitty Pryde]]) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Psylocke]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' estranged wife [[Madelyne Pryor]]) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered.\n\n===X-Factor===\nX-Factor ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]) is transported to the [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] of the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor-sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team [[Power Pack]] helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the [[Statue of Liberty]]. As the team battles the Horsemen, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it.\n\n===The New Mutants===\nThe New Mutants ([[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]])  head off to visit their friend [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as [[The Right (comics)|The Right]] tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. They then return home, where [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (headmaster of the Xavier School in [[Professor X]]'s absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death. Disgusted, the team quits Magneto's tutelage, while deciding to stay dedicated to Professor X's dream of peace.\n\n==Tie-Ins==\nWhile not officially part of the crossover, a number of other Marvel comic books were billed as \"Fall of the Mutants\" Tie-Ins:\n*'''Captain America''' #339\n:As a reward for defeating Marvel Girl, Apocalypse teleports his Horseman [[Famine (comics)|Famine]] to the American midwest to destroy its crops and cattle with her life-draining powers. [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] (who had at the time given up the uniform of Captain America and was simply operating as \"The Captain\"), along with allies [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]], fight and bring an end to her attack on \"America's bread basket\".\n\n*'''Daredevil''' #248-249 252\n:Apocalypse's attack on New York City brings chaos and looting to its streets, with many citizens thinking a nuclear attack has occurred. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] do their part to restore order.\n\n*'''Power Pack''' #35\n:The children of [[Power Pack]] become involved in the chaos of Apocalypse's attack on the city and come into conflict with the Horseman Pestilence. Pestilence dies when part of the Empire State Building falls on her, but not before she infects [[Katie Power]].

It spanned three issues each of ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #225-227, ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #24-26, and ''[[New Mutants]]''  #59-61; unlike most crossovers however, the various titles' storylines did not intertwine, but were instead linked thematically as each team underwent major ordeals and drastic changes in their status quo.\n\nThe 1990 computer game ''[[X-Men II: The Fall of the Mutants]]'' was based on this storyline.\n\n==Promotion==\n[[Image:Mutant Reg Ad.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The faux-advertisement for the Mutant Registration Act. The \"mutie\" is [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]. Art by [[Jon Bogdanove]].]] Marvel Comics used a novel approach in advertising the crossover event. A major element within the stories at the time was the public's growing concern over the \"[[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] menace\" and [[Senator Robert Kelly]]'s proposed [[Mutant Registration Act]], which foreshadowed the dystopian future shown in \"[[Days of Future Past]]\". Marvel distributed postcard-size mock advertisements supporting the act in comic book stores as well as their various titles [[cover date]]d \"November 1987\". Asking \"Do You Know What Your Children Are?\", the card further suggested that anyone who knew themselves to be a mutant should fill out the form on the back and mail it in to register themselves with the government.\n\n==Plot summary==\n''The Fall of the Mutants'' consists of three separate non-intersecting storylines: one involving the X-Men, one involving X-Factor, and the other concerning the New Mutants.\n\n===Uncanny X-Men===\nThe [[X-Men]] head to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in search of their missing and de-powered leader [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], herself seeking the mutant inventor [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] to restore her powers. Upon arrival, they encounter [[Freedom Force (comics)#Mystique's Freedom Force|Freedom Force]], a government-sanctioned strike team of reformed villains led by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], who are under orders to arrest the X-Men for refusing to comply with the Mutant Registration Act, and a fight ensues. Freedom Force's mutant [[precognition|precognitive]] [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] then has a vision: everyone inside a particular Dallas skyscraper at dawn will be dead. Once it begins snowing \u2014 in Texas, in the middle of summer \u2014 and as [[caveman|cavemen]], dinosaurs, and other strange peoples and creatures begin appearing, the two teams realize that something of immense significance is occurring. Calling a temporary truce, they turn to restore order to the chaos engulfing the city.  Many of the events are broadcast on television by a reporter [[Neal Conan]] and cameraman [[Manoli Wetherell]], who accompany the X-Men and Freedom Force.\n\nStorm and Forge meanwhile find themselves in a pristine, natural world all to themselves. In this new Earth, time proceeds at an accelerated rate, and while only a few moments pass in the main reality, a year does for them. Storm, still hating the man she once loved (as Forge invented the Neutralizer gun that removed her mutant powers),<ref>'' The Uncanny X-Men'' #185\u2013186</ref> spends most of the year in solitude until she is finally ready to make her peace with him. Forge meanwhile had been developing technology from the ground up, eventually creating the tools \u2014 and with circuitry sourced from dismantling his bionic arm and leg \u2014 enabling him to build a device that restores Storm's weather manipulation powers. Storm, after months of being grounded, takes to the skies again with joy. Forge uses his shamanic magic in conjunction with her lightning bolts to open a portal back to Dallas.\n\nTime and space meanwhile run amok in the city, as the X-Men and Freedom Force find themselves amidst a scene from the [[Vietnam War]]. It is revealed that during his tour of duty, Forge had used his shamanic powers to summon a demon to avenge his fallen comrades. However, in his naivet\u00e9, he did not realize that the spell required the souls of his nine comrades and unleashed a horde of demons he had no way to control, including the [[Adversary (comics)|Adversary]], the creature responsible for the chaos they now found themselves in.\n\nAs Storm and Forge join the battle, it quickly becomes apparent that the Adversary cannot be defeated, and the only way to be rid of him is for Forge to cast the same spell and seal him away forever. Millions watch the television broadcast (including a horrified [[Kitty Pryde]]) as Forge casts the spell, using the souls of the nine X-Men (Storm, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], [[Psylocke]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]]' estranged wife [[Madelyne Pryor]]) to fuel it. As foreseen by Destiny, the X-Men die. However, the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], who had also become embroiled in the day's events, takes pity on the X-Men for their noble sacrifice and returns them all to life, additionally commenting to them that as foul and evil as the Adversary is, he should not and cannot be locked away forever, since from the chaos he creates positive change and growth occurs. However, he was bound for an age, which Roma decreed was sufficient punishment for his crime. She additionally made the X-Men invisible to all forms of surveillance save plain sight, thus allowing them to continue with their operations while the world assumes they are dead. Believing that if the world thinks the X-Men are dead they will have the freedom to fight their enemies without the people they cared for being hurt as collateral damage. Before they head to Australia to establish a new base, she gives them the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]], telling them they could use it to 'reset' time should they be discovered.\n\n===X-Factor===\nX-Factor ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]]) is transported to the [[Ship (comics)|Ship]] of the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. Offered a place by his side in his evolutionary war against humans, they refuse, and a battle ensues between X-Factor and his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen]]. The horseman Death then reveals himself to be their former teammate [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], thought dead and now remade in Apocalypse's image with deadly, razor-sharp wings. He quickly defeats the team and they are restrained save for Caliban, who surrenders himself to Apocalypse in return for powers like Death. Apocalypse then unleashes his Horsemen on New York City and tries to force the heroes to watch. They are able to break free of their restraints, and attempt to stop the Horseman. In the process, they accidentally cause Apocalypse's airship to lose control, damaging several skyscrapers as it loses altitude. The preteen superhero team [[Power Pack]] helps limit the damage, destroying part of the airship's engine cowling just before the cowling would have impacted the [[Statue of Liberty]]. As the team battles the Horsemen, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] comes up with an idea to stop Death, and creates a statue of himself out of ice. Death attacks and breaks the statue and, thinking it is actually Iceman, is overcome with guilt and switches sides. Apocalypse easily repels his attacks, but decides to make a tactical withdrawal anyway. After he leaves, the team attempts to regain control of Apocalypse's airship, eventually bringing it to land on top of their headquarters, crushing it.\n\n===The New Mutants===\nThe New Mutants ([[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]], [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]])  head off to visit their friend [[Bird-Brain (Marvel Comics)|Bird-Brain]] on his remote island. There, they quickly discover that Bird-Brain's creator, the Ani-Mator, is creating more semi-sentient creatures (the Ani-Mates), which he mistreats and experiments on. As the team attempts to free them, the anti-mutant organization known as [[The Right (comics)|The Right]] tracks them down and attacks. During the three-pronged battle, Cypher is shot and killed, taking a bullet meant for Wolfsbane. Eventually, Bird-Brain defeats the Ani-Mator and becomes king of the Ani-Mates, and Magik teleports the Right's soldiers, along with the Ani-Mator himself, to [[Otherplace|Limbo]]. They then return home, where [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] (headmaster of the Xavier School in [[Professor X]]'s absence) blames humanity for Cypher's death. Disgusted, the team quits Magneto's tutelage, while deciding to stay dedicated to Professor X's dream of peace.\n\n==Tie-Ins==\nWhile not officially part of the crossover, a number of other Marvel comic books were billed as \"Fall of the Mutants\" Tie-Ins:\n*'''Captain America''' #339\nAs a reward for defeating Marvel Girl, Apocalypse teleports his Horseman [[Famine (comics)|Famine]] to the American midwest to destroy its crops and cattle with her life-draining powers. [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] (who had at the time given up the uniform of Captain America and was simply operating as \"The Captain\"), along with allies [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]], fight and bring an end to her attack on \"America's bread basket\".\n\n*'''Daredevil''' #248-249 252\nApocalypse's attack on New York City brings chaos and looting to its streets, with many citizens thinking a nuclear attack has occurred. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] do their part to restore order.\n\n*'''Power Pack''' #35\nThe children of [[Power Pack]] become involved in the chaos of Apocalypse's attack on the city and come into conflict with the Horseman Pestilence. Pestilence dies when part of the Empire State Building falls on her, but not before she infects [[Katie Power]].
