{"title_page": "Body painting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Face Painter|the EP|Emma Dean (musician)|the Seinfeld episode|The Face Painter}}\n[[File:Deas Wa-kon-cha-hi-re-ga.jpg|thumb|Indigenous American body painting]]\n\n'''Body painting''' is a form of [[body art]] where artwork is painted directly onto the human [[skin]]. Unlike [[tattoo]]s and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, lasting several hours or sometimes up to a few weeks (in the case of [[mehndi]] or \"henna tattoos\" about two weeks). Body painting that is limited to the [[face]] is known as \"[[face painting]]\". Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) \"temporary tattoo\". Large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work can sometimes be referred to as temporary tattoos.\n\n==Indigenous==\n[[File:George_Catlin_005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Indigenous body painting]]\nBody painting with a grey or white paint made from natural [[pigment]]s including clay, chalk, ash and cattle dung is traditional in many [[tribal]] cultures. Often worn during cultural ceremonies, it is believed to assist with the moderation of body heat and the use of striped patterns may reduce the incidence of biting insects. It still survives in this ancient form among [[Indigenous Australians]] and in parts of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|title='Zebra' tribal bodypaint cuts fly bites 10-fold: study|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-01-zebra-tribal-bodypaint-fold.html|work=phys.org|date=16 January 2019}}</ref> as well as in [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific islands]]. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as ''[[Mehndi]]'', using dyes made of [[henna|henna leaves]] (hence also known rather erroneously as \"henna tattoo\"), is practiced in [[India]], especially on [[bride]]s. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young [[women]] in the Western world.\n\nMany [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of Central and South America paint [[jagua tattoo]]s, or designs with ''[[Genipa americana]]'' juice on their bodies. [[Indigenous peoples of South America]] traditionally use [[annatto]], [[huito]], or wet [[charcoal]] to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dinhora |last=Monta\u00f1ez R |title=Body painting, el arte de la poes\u00eda corporal: Sobre el trabajo de Mao Mix R |year=2013 |location=Neiva|editor=Diario del Huila}}</ref>\n\n==Western==\n[[File:Orca body painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A painted orca design on a [[forearm]].]] \nBody painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies. There has been a revival of body painting in Western society since the 1960s, in part prompted by the liberalization of [[social mores]] regarding [[nudity]] and often comes in [[sensationalist]] or [[exhibitionist]] forms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/painting/body.htm |title=Body Painting: History, Origins, Types, Methods, Festivals: Tribal Art |publisher=Visual-arts-cork.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}</ref> Even today there is a constant debate about the legitimacy of body painting as an art form.

French artist [[Yves Klein]] is perhaps the most famous for this, with his series of paintings \"Anthropometries\". The effect produced by this technique creates an image-transfer from the model's body to the medium. This includes all the curves of the model's body (typically female) being reflected in the outline of the image. This technique was not necessarily monotone; multiple colors on different body parts sometimes produced interesting effects.\n\n[[Joanne Gair]] is a body paint artist whose work appeared for the tenth consecutive year in the 2008 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''. She came to prominence with an August 1992 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' ''[[Demi's Birthday Suit]]'' cover of [[Demi Moore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photoimpactonline.com/gair.htm |title=Make-Up Illusion by Joanne Gair |accessdate=2008-02-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221204220/http://www.photoimpactonline.com/gair.htm |archivedate=2007-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mocoloco.com/art/archives/004340.php |title=Body Painting: Masterpieces by Joanne Gair |work=Art MOCO: The Modern and Contemporary Art Blog |accessdate=2008-02-18 |date=2007-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205095055/http://mocoloco.com/art/archives/004340.php |archivedate=2008-02-05 }}</ref> Her ''[[Disappearing Model]]'' was part of an episode of ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]''.<ref name=\"JGTAoI\">{{cite web |url=http://www.joannegair.com/about.htm |title=Joanne Gair: The Art of Illusion |accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:FantasyFest1-35.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|An artist body painting at [[Fantasy Fest]]]]\n\nBody painting festivals happen annually across the world, bringing together professional body painters and keen amateurs.

Participants attend from over fifty countries and the event has more than 20,000 visitors.\n\nBody painting festivals that take place in North America include the North American Body Painting Championship, Face and Body Art International Convention in [[Orlando, Florida]], Bodygras Body Painting Competition in [[Nanaimo, BC]] and the Face Painting and Body Art Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n\nAustralia also has a number of body painting festivals, most notably the annual Australian Body Art Festival in [[Eumundi, Queensland]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Body Art Festival|url=http://australianbodyart.com.au/|website=Australian Body Art Festival|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref> and the Australian Body Art Awards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Body Art Awards|url=http://www.australianbodyartawards.com.au/|website=Australian Body Art Awards|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the [[Rabarama Skin Art Festival]] (held every year during the Summer and Autumn, with a tour in the major Italian cities), is a different event focused on the artistic side of body painting, highlighting the emotional impact of the painted body in a live performance<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLGBeKZbj4&t=17s|title=Finale 2016 del Rabarama Skin Art Festival, video TG|first=|last=Kryolan Italia|date=4 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> more than the decorative and technical aspects of it.

More recently Dutch art photographer [[Karl Hammer]] has taken center stage with his combinations of body painting and narrative art ([[fantastic realism]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nFollowing the already established trend in Western-Europe, body painting has become more widely accepted in the United States since the early 1990s. In 2006 the first gallery dedicated exclusively to fine art body painting was opened in New Orleans by World Bodypainting Festival Champion and Judge, Craig Tracy. The [[Painted Alive Gallery]] is on Royal Street in the [[French Quarter]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2009, a popular late night talk show ''Last Call with Carson Daly'' on NBC network, featured a New York-based artist Danny Setiawan who creates reproductions of masterpieces by famous artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Gustav Klimt]] on human bodies aiming to make fine art appealing for his contemporaries who normally would not consider themselves as art enthusiasts.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nSince 2005 the Australian visual artist [[Emma Hack]] has been creating photographs of painted naked human bodies that visually merge with a patterned background wall inspired by the wallpaper designs of [[Florence Broadhurst]].

Stills advertising also used body painting with hundreds of body painting looks on the pages of the world's magazines every year. Body painters also work frequently in the film arena especially in science fiction with an increasing number of elaborate alien creations being body painted.\n\nThe ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', published annually, has frequently featured a section of models that were body painted, attired in renditions of swimsuits or sports jerseys. Also ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine has frequently made use of body painted models. In the 2005 ''Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion'' calendar, all [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s appeared in the calendar wearing bikinis, but Playmates [[Karen McDougal]] and [[Hiromi Oshima]] actually appeared in painted-on bikinis for their respective months.\n\nThe success of body painting has led to many notable international competitions and a specific trade magazine (''Illusion Magazine'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://illusionmagazine.co.uk/illusion-magazine|title=Illusion Magazine|author=|date=|work=illusionmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> for this industry, showcasing work around the world.\n\n==Face painting==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:MochePaintedFace.jpg|thumb|right|Moche ceramic vessel at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], depicting a man, possibly a warrior, with face painting]]\n[[File:Face paint (48885955637).jpg|thumb|left|A child wearing face paint]]\n[[File:Marcus Stewart and Mariana Catalina in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Ryan Castalia for Stairwell Theater, 2019.jpg|thumb|Marcus Stewart with his face painted as he acts in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Ryan Castalia for Stairwell Theater, 2019]]\nFace painting is the artistic application of cosmetic \"paint\" to a person's face. From ancient times, it has been used for [[hunting]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[military]] reasons (such as [[camouflage]] and to indicate membership in a military unit).\n\nIn some forms of [[folk dance]], such as [[Border Morris]], the faces of the dancers are painted with a black [[pigment]] in a tradition that goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 18th century [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] face painting became popular with men and women of the aristocracy and the [[nouveau riche]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Makeup And Lead Poisoning In The 18th Century|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/objectretrieval/node/111|publisher=University College London|author=Emma Chambers|access-date=14 November 2017}}</ref> but it died out in Western culture after the fall of the French aristocracy.

More subdued form of face paints for everyday occasions evolved into the [[cosmetics]] we know today.\n\nFor several decades it has been a common entertainment at county [[fair]]s, large open-air [[Market (place)|market]]s (especially in Europe and the Americas), and other locations that attract children and adolescents. Face painting is very popular among children at [[theme park]]s, parties and [[festival]]s throughout the Western world. Though the majority of face painting is geared towards children, many teenagers and adults enjoy being painted for special events, such as sports events (to give support to their team or country) or charity fund raisers. Face painting is also a part of cosplay practice, and is enjoyed yearly by people who dress up as zombies to dance with the annual worldwide \"Thrill the World\" event on the Saturday before Halloween.\n\nFull face paint or a painted black nose is sometimes added when a person is dressed in an animal costume.\n\nMost theme parks have booths scattered around where a person can have a design painted on their face. A similar activity is the application of \"instant [[tattoo]]s\", which are paint or ink-based designs that are put on as one unit and removed by means of water, [[alcohol]], [[soap]], or another mild [[solvent]]. More elaborate [[temporary tattoo]]s may be made using stencils and airbrush equipment.\n\n===In the military===\n{{Main|Military camouflage}}\n[[File:Maskowanie.JPEG|thumb|right|A soldier applies face paints as [[military camouflage]].]]\n\nIt is common in armies all over the world for soldiers in combat to paint their faces and other exposed body parts (hands, for example) in natural colors such as green, tan, and [[loam]] for [[camouflage]] purposes. In various South American armies, it is a tradition to use face paint on parade in respect to the indigenous tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taringa.net/comunidades/naiem/7850065/Brigada-de-Fusileros-Paracaidistas-Mexicanos.html|title=Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas Mexicanos|language=es|author=|date=|work=taringa.net|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Temporary tattoos==\nAs well as paint, temporary tattoos can be used to decorate the body. \"Glitter tattoos\" are made by applying a clear, cosmetic-grade glue (either freehand or through a stencil) on the skin and then coating it with cosmetic-grade [[glitter]]. They can last up to a week depending on the model's body chemistry.\n\nFoil metallic temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using foil stamping technique instead of ink. On the front side, the foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\n==Body paints==\n[[File:Ultraviolet body painting at WBF 2014 1.jpg|thumb|right|Fluorescent body paint will show up as bright and colourful under [[ultraviolet light]].]]\nModern water-based face and body paints are made according to stringent guidelines, meaning these are non-[[toxic]], usually non-[[allergenic]], and can easily be washed away. Temporary staining may develop after use, but it will fade after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, paint brush, and synthetic sponges or natural [[sea sponge]], or alternatively with an [[airbrush]].\n\n[[File:Blacklight bodypainting leevi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Body painting with [[fluorescent]] paint]] \nContrary to the popular [[List of MythBusters special episodes#Pilot 3 \u2014 \"Larry's Lawn Chair Balloon, Poppy Seed Drug Test, Goldfinger\"|myth]] perpetuated by the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', a person is not [[asphyxia]]ted if their whole body is painted.<ref>Metin Tolan - Gesch\u00fcttelt, nicht ger\u00fchrt, Piper Verlag</ref>\n\n[[Liquid latex]] may also be used as body paint. Aside the risk of [[Latex allergy|contact allergy]], wearing latex for a prolonged period may cause [[heat stroke]] by inhibiting [[perspiration]] and care should be taken to avoid the painful removal of hair when the latex is pulled off.\n\nThe same precautions that apply to [[cosmetics]] should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of [[allergy]] from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, it should not be applied to [[wound|damaged]], inflamed or sensitive skin. If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for use around the eye area\u2014generally those associated with certain reddish colorants, as CI 15850 or [[CI 15985]]\u2014or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing [[CI 77007]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Color Additive Status List |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/UCM106626 |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Summary of Color Additives for Use in United States in Foods, Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Devices |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm115641.htm#table3A |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=March 2007}}</ref> More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible [[lead]] on cosmetic additives, as part of [[Proposition 65]].<ref>{{cite web |title=California Proposition 65 Update: Lead Limits for Cosmetic Products |url=http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/psls/en/1X05YAZ7/1/Product-Safety-Laws-And-Standards/California-Proposition-65-Update-Lead-Limits-For-Cosmetic-Products.htm |publisher=Hong Kong Trade Development Council |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=18 June 2009}}</ref> In the European Union, all colorants listed under a [[Colour Index International|CI]] number are allowed for use on all areas. Any paints or products which have not been formulated for use on the body should never be used for body or face painting, as these can result in serious allergic reactions.\n\nAs for [[Mehndi]], natural brown henna dyes are safe to use when mixed with ingredients such as lemon juice. Another option is Jagua, a dark indigo plant-based dye that is safe to use on the skin and is approved for cosmetic use in the EU.\n\n==Body marbling==\n[[File:Body Marbled Hand - 1.jpg|thumb|A hand [[Body marbling|marbled]] by dipping into floating non-toxic paint]]\n{{main|Body marbling}}\n\nHands and faces can be marbled temporarily for events such as festivals, using a painting process similar to traditional [[paper marbling]], in which paint is floated on water and transferred to a person's skin. Unlike the traditional oil-based technique for paper, neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valenti|first1=Lauren|title=The New \"Body Marbling\" Trend Is Must-See Stuff, People|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a22529/body-marbling-trend/|publisher=Marie Claire|date=9 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Scott, Ellen |title=Body Marbling Is the New Festival Trend You're Going to Be Obsessed with |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/09/body-marbling-is-the-new-festival-trend-youre-going-to-be-obsessed-with-6119406/ |work=Metro |date=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Hand art==\n\"Hand art\" is the application of [[make-up]] or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like [[Guido Daniele]], produce images that are [[trompe l'oeil]] representations of wild animals painted on people's hands.\n\nHand artists work closely with [[hand model]]s. Hand models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under \"body part model\" or \"hands and feet models\".\n\n==Media==\n\nBody painting features in various media. The popular TV variety show, ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'', featured bodies painted with comedic phrases and jokes during transitions. ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'', a 1996 film by [[Peter Greenaway]], is centred on body painting. The 1990 [[United States|American]] film ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' featured several examples of models who were painted to blend into elaborate backdrops as [[trompe-l'\u0153il]]. [[Skin Wars]] is a body painting reality competition hosted by [[Rebecca Romijn]] that premiered on [[Game Show Network]] on August 6, 2014.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category multi|Body painting|Facepainting}}\n{{Portal|Human sexuality|Visual arts|Fashion}} \n* [[Blacklight paint]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Clothing-optional bike rides]]\n** [[Solstice Cyclists]]\n** [[World Naked Bike Ride]]\n* [[Make up]]\n* [[Mehndi]] (so-called [[henna]] tattoos)\n* [[Special effects]]\n* [[World Body Painting Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://facebodyart.com/face-painting-for-beginners/ Ultimate Face Painting Tutorial for Beginners: Your step-by-step guide for learning how to face paint]\n* [https://bodypainting-festival.com/en/ World Bodypainting Festival website]\n\n{{Nudity}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Body Painting}}\n[[Category:Optical illusions]]\n[[Category:Special effects]]\n[[Category:Nude art]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Face Painter|the EP|Emma Dean (musician)|the Seinfeld episode|The Face Painter}}\n[[File:Deas Wa-kon-cha-hi-re-ga.jpg|thumb|Indigenous American body painting]]\n\n'''Body painting''' is a form of [[body art]] where artwork is painted directly onto the human [[skin]]. Unlike [[tattoo]]s and other forms of body art, body painting is temporary, lasting several hours or sometimes up to a few weeks (in the case of [[mehndi]] or \"henna tattoos\" about two weeks). Body painting that is limited to the [[face]] is known as \"[[face painting]]\". Body painting is also referred to as (a form of) \"temporary tattoo\". Large scale or full-body painting is more commonly referred to as body painting, while smaller or more detailed work can sometimes be referred to as temporary tattoos.\n\n==Indigenous==\n[[File:George_Catlin_005.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Indigenous body painting]]\nBody painting with a grey or white paint made from natural [[pigment]]s including clay, chalk, ash and cattle dung is traditional in many [[tribal]] cultures. Often worn during cultural ceremonies, it is believed to assist with the moderation of body heat and the use of striped patterns may reduce the incidence of biting insects. It still survives in this ancient form among [[Indigenous Australians]] and in parts of [[Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|title='Zebra' tribal bodypaint cuts fly bites 10-fold: study|url=https://phys.org/news/2019-01-zebra-tribal-bodypaint-fold.html|work=phys.org|date=16 January 2019}}</ref> as well as in [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific islands]]. A semi-permanent form of body painting known as ''[[Mehndi]]'', using dyes made of [[henna|henna leaves]] (hence also known rather erroneously as \"henna tattoo\"), is practiced in [[India]], especially on [[bride]]s. Since the late 1990s, Mehndi has become popular amongst young [[women]] in the Western world.\n\nMany [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of Central and South America paint [[jagua tattoo]]s, or designs with ''[[Genipa americana]]'' juice on their bodies. [[Indigenous peoples of South America]] traditionally use [[annatto]], [[huito]], or wet [[charcoal]] to decorate their faces and bodies. Huito is semi-permanent, and it generally takes weeks for this black dye to fade.<ref>{{cite book|first=Dinhora |last=Monta\u00f1ez R |title=Body painting, el arte de la poes\u00eda corporal: Sobre el trabajo de Mao Mix R |year=2013 |location=Neiva|editor=Diario del Huila}}</ref>\n\n==Western==\n[[File:Orca body painting.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|A painted orca design on a [[forearm]].]] \nBody painting is not always large pieces on fully nude bodies, but can involve smaller pieces on displayed areas of otherwise clothed bodies.

French artist [[Yves Klein]] is perhaps the most famous for this, with his series of paintings \"Anthropometries\". The effect produced by this technique creates an image-transfer from the model's body to the medium. This includes all the curves of the model's body (typically female) being reflected in the outline of the image. This technique was not necessarily monotone; multiple colors on different body parts sometimes produced interesting effects.\n\n[[Joanne Gair]] is a body paint artist whose work appeared for the tenth consecutive year in the 2008 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]''.

The [[Painted Alive Gallery]] is on Royal Street in the [[French Quarter]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 2009, a popular late night talk show ''Last Call with Carson Daly'' on NBC network, featured a New York-based artist Danny Setiawan who creates reproductions of masterpieces by famous artists such as [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Gustav Klimt]] on human bodies aiming to make fine art appealing for his contemporaries who normally would not consider themselves as art enthusiasts.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nSince 2005 the Australian visual artist [[Emma Hack]] has been creating photographs of painted naked human bodies that visually merge with a patterned background wall inspired by the wallpaper designs of [[Florence Broadhurst]]. Hack is best known for the [[Gotye]] music video for the song ''[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]'', which uses [[stop-motion]] animation body painting and has received over 800 million views on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite news|first=Debbie|last=Cuthbertson|title=Adelaide artist Emma Hack breathes new life into Florence Broadhurst archive|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 January 2014|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/adelaide-artist-emma-hack-breathes-new-life-into-florence-broadhurst-archive-20140116-30xlt.html }}</ref> Hack now creates her own canvas backgrounds and her work is often featured with live birds, representing nature.

Stills advertising also used body painting with hundreds of body painting looks on the pages of the world's magazines every year. Body painters also work frequently in the film arena especially in science fiction with an increasing number of elaborate alien creations being body painted.\n\nThe ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', published annually, has frequently featured a section of models that were body painted, attired in renditions of swimsuits or sports jerseys. Also ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine has frequently made use of body painted models. In the 2005 ''Playmates at Play at the Playboy Mansion'' calendar, all [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]]s appeared in the calendar wearing bikinis, but Playmates [[Karen McDougal]] and [[Hiromi Oshima]] actually appeared in painted-on bikinis for their respective months.\n\nThe success of body painting has led to many notable international competitions and a specific trade magazine (''Illusion Magazine'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://illusionmagazine.co.uk/illusion-magazine|title=Illusion Magazine|author=|date=|work=illusionmagazine.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> for this industry, showcasing work around the world.\n\n==Face painting==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:MochePaintedFace.jpg|thumb|right|Moche ceramic vessel at the [[Larco Museum]] in [[Lima]], depicting a man, possibly a warrior, with face painting]]\n[[File:Face paint (48885955637).jpg|thumb|A child wearing face paint]]\n[[File:Marcus Stewart and Mariana Catalina in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Ryan Castalia for Stairwell Theater, 2019.jpg|thumb|Marcus Stewart with his face painted as he acts in Oresteia by Aeschylus, adapted by Ryan Castalia for Stairwell Theater, 2019]]\nFace painting is the artistic application of cosmetic \"paint\" to a person's face. From ancient times, it has been used for [[hunting]], [[religion|religious reasons]], and [[military]] reasons (such as [[camouflage]] and to indicate membership in a military unit).\n\nIn some forms of [[folk dance]], such as [[Border Morris]], the faces of the dancers are painted with a black [[pigment]] in a tradition that goes back to the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 18th century [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] face painting became popular with men and women of the aristocracy and the [[nouveau riche]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Makeup And Lead Poisoning In The 18th Century|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/objectretrieval/node/111|publisher=University College London|author=Emma Chambers|access-date=14 November 2017}}</ref> but it died out in Western culture after the fall of the French aristocracy. During the 19th century [[blackface]] theatrical makeup gained popularity when it was used by non-black performers to represent [[black people]], typically in a minstrel show.<ref>{{cite book|first=William John|last=Mahar|title=Behind the Burnt Cork Mask: Early Blackface Minstrelsy and Antebellum American Popular Culture|url=https://archive.org/details/behindburntcorkm00will|url-access=registration|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/behindburntcorkm00will/page/9 9]|isbn=0-252-06696-0}}</ref> Its use ended in the United States with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5cVSVbOu2EC|first=Frank W.|last=Sweet|title=A History of the Minstrel Show|publisher=Boxes & Arrows|year=2000|page=25|isbn=9780939479214}}</ref> at about the same time that face painting re-entered the popular culture as part of the [[hippie]] movement of the late 1960s, when it was common for young people to decorate their cheeks with flowers or [[peace symbols]] at anti-war demonstrations.\n\n[[Actor]]s and [[clown]]s around the world have painted their faces\u2014and sometimes bodies\u2014for centuries, and continue to do so today. More subdued form of face paints for everyday occasions evolved into the [[cosmetics]] we know today.\n\nFor several decades it has been a common entertainment at county [[fair]]s, large open-air [[Market (place)|market]]s (especially in Europe and the Americas), and other locations that attract children and adolescents. Face painting is very popular among children at [[theme park]]s, parties and [[festival]]s throughout the Western world. Though the majority of face painting is geared towards children, many teenagers and adults enjoy being painted for special events, such as sports events (to give support to their team or country) or charity fund raisers. Face painting is also a part of cosplay practice, and is enjoyed yearly by people who dress up as zombies to dance with the annual worldwide \"Thrill the World\" event on the Saturday before Halloween.\n\nFull face paint or a painted black nose is sometimes added when a person is dressed in an animal costume.\n\nMost theme parks have booths scattered around where a person can have a design painted on their face. A similar activity is the application of \"instant [[tattoo]]s\", which are paint or ink-based designs that are put on as one unit and removed by means of water, [[alcohol]], [[soap]], or another mild [[solvent]]. More elaborate [[temporary tattoo]]s may be made using stencils and airbrush equipment.\n\n===In the military===\n{{Main|Military camouflage}}\n[[File:Maskowanie.JPEG|thumb|right|A soldier applies face paints as [[military camouflage]].]]\n\nIt is common in armies all over the world for soldiers in combat to paint their faces and other exposed body parts (hands, for example) in natural colors such as green, tan, and [[loam]] for [[camouflage]] purposes. In various South American armies, it is a tradition to use face paint on parade in respect to the indigenous tribes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taringa.net/comunidades/naiem/7850065/Brigada-de-Fusileros-Paracaidistas-Mexicanos.html|title=Brigada de Fusileros Paracaidistas Mexicanos|language=es|author=|date=|work=taringa.net|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Temporary tattoos==\nAs well as paint, temporary tattoos can be used to decorate the body. \"Glitter tattoos\" are made by applying a clear, cosmetic-grade glue (either freehand or through a stencil) on the skin and then coating it with cosmetic-grade [[glitter]]. They can last up to a week depending on the model's body chemistry.\n\nFoil metallic temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using foil stamping technique instead of ink. On the front side, the foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\n==Body paints==\n[[File:Ultraviolet body painting at WBF 2014 1.jpg|thumb|right|Fluorescent body paint will show up as bright and colourful under [[ultraviolet light]].]]\nModern water-based face and body paints are made according to stringent guidelines, meaning these are non-[[toxic]], usually non-[[allergenic]], and can easily be washed away. Temporary staining may develop after use, but it will fade after normal washing. These are either applied with hands, paint brush, and synthetic sponges or natural [[sea sponge]], or alternatively with an [[airbrush]].\n\n[[File:Blacklight bodypainting leevi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Body painting with [[fluorescent]] paint]] \nContrary to the popular [[List of MythBusters special episodes#Pilot 3 \u2014 \"Larry's Lawn Chair Balloon, Poppy Seed Drug Test, Goldfinger\"|myth]] perpetuated by the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'', a person is not [[asphyxia]]ted if their whole body is painted.<ref>Metin Tolan - Gesch\u00fcttelt, nicht ger\u00fchrt, Piper Verlag</ref>\n\n[[Liquid latex]] may also be used as body paint. Aside the risk of [[Latex allergy|contact allergy]], wearing latex for a prolonged period may cause [[heat stroke]] by inhibiting [[perspiration]] and care should be taken to avoid the painful removal of hair when the latex is pulled off.\n\nThe same precautions that apply to [[cosmetics]] should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of [[allergy]] from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, it should not be applied to [[wound|damaged]], inflamed or sensitive skin. If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for use around the eye area\u2014generally those associated with certain reddish colorants, as CI 15850 or [[CI 15985]]\u2014or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing [[CI 77007]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Color Additive Status List |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/UCM106626 |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Summary of Color Additives for Use in United States in Foods, Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Devices |url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm115641.htm#table3A |publisher=The Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=March 2007}}</ref> More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible [[lead]] on cosmetic additives, as part of [[Proposition 65]].<ref>{{cite web |title=California Proposition 65 Update: Lead Limits for Cosmetic Products |url=http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/psls/en/1X05YAZ7/1/Product-Safety-Laws-And-Standards/California-Proposition-65-Update-Lead-Limits-For-Cosmetic-Products.htm |publisher=Hong Kong Trade Development Council |accessdate=3 August 2011 |date=18 June 2009}}</ref> In the European Union, all colorants listed under a [[Colour Index International|CI]] number are allowed for use on all areas. Any paints or products which have not been formulated for use on the body should never be used for body or face painting, as these can result in serious allergic reactions.\n\nAs for [[Mehndi]], natural brown henna dyes are safe to use when mixed with ingredients such as lemon juice. Another option is Jagua, a dark indigo plant-based dye that is safe to use on the skin and is approved for cosmetic use in the EU.\n\n==Body marbling==\n[[File:Body Marbled Hand - 1.jpg|thumb|A hand [[Body marbling|marbled]] by dipping into floating non-toxic paint]]\n{{main|Body marbling}}\n\nHands and faces can be marbled temporarily for events such as festivals, using a painting process similar to traditional [[paper marbling]], in which paint is floated on water and transferred to a person's skin. Unlike the traditional oil-based technique for paper, neon or ultraviolet reactive colours are typically used, and the paint is water-based and non-toxic.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valenti|first1=Lauren|title=The New \"Body Marbling\" Trend Is Must-See Stuff, People|url=http://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a22529/body-marbling-trend/|publisher=Marie Claire|date=9 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Scott, Ellen |title=Body Marbling Is the New Festival Trend You're Going to Be Obsessed with |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/09/09/body-marbling-is-the-new-festival-trend-youre-going-to-be-obsessed-with-6119406/ |work=Metro |date=9 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Hand art==\n\"Hand art\" is the application of [[make-up]] or paint to a hand to make it appear like an animal or other object. Some hand artists, like [[Guido Daniele]], produce images that are [[trompe l'oeil]] representations of wild animals painted on people's hands.\n\nHand artists work closely with [[hand model]]s. Hand models can be booked through specialist acting and modeling agencies usually advertising under \"body part model\" or \"hands and feet models\".\n\n==Media==\n\nBody painting features in various media. The popular TV variety show, ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'', featured bodies painted with comedic phrases and jokes during transitions. ''[[The Pillow Book (film)|The Pillow Book]]'', a 1996 film by [[Peter Greenaway]], is centred on body painting. The 1990 [[United States|American]] film ''[[Where the Heart Is (1990 film)|Where the Heart Is]]'' featured several examples of models who were painted to blend into elaborate backdrops as [[trompe-l'\u0153il]].

The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. WBAY-TV's studios are located on South Jefferson Street in downtown Green Bay (across from the historic [[Brown County Courthouse (Wisconsin)|Brown County Courthouse]]), and its transmitter is located in [[Ledgeview, Wisconsin]] (shared with the transmitters of [[PBS Wisconsin]] station WPNE-TV and [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] station [[WPNE (FM)|WPNE]] (89.3 FM)).\n\n==History==\n[[File:WBAYTVMidwestRadioGreenBayWisconsinStudiosMay2007.jpg|thumb|left|Studios in 2007.]]\nWBAY-TV first signed on the air on March 17, 1953 as the second television station in Wisconsin, after [[WTMJ-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]. It was originally owned by the [[Norbertine]] Order of Priests, whose abbey is in nearby [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. The priests run [[St. Norbert College]] in De Pere, and already operated WBAY radio (1360 AM, now [[WTAQ]]) in Green Bay and [[WHBY]] radio in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. Like WTMJ when that station started in 1947, as the only station in the market, WBAY originally carried programming from all four networks of the day \u2013 channel 2 was a primary [[CBS]] affiliate with secondary affiliations with [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]].\n\nNBC moved to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]'s WMBV-TV (channel 11, now [[WLUK-TV]]) when it signed on in 1954, with WNAM-TV (channel 42, now [[WFRV-TV]] Channel 5) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] taking the ABC affiliation upon its 1955 debut. With the shutdown of DuMont in 1956, WBAY was left as an exclusive CBS affiliate, and remained the only station licensed to Green Bay proper until the 1959 relocation of WLUK to the city. Channel 2 upgraded its transmitter and began broadcasting network programming in color around 1959; locally produced programs were broadcast in color starting in 1966.\n\nThe station's studios in downtown Green Bay were built in 1924 as a former [[Knights of Columbus]] clubhouse and later was turned into a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] during the [[Great Depression]] when the Norbertines took over the building. The former gymnasium/auditorium is now called the WBAY Auditorium and is used as the studio for the station's [[cerebral palsy]] [[telethon]]. During the early years of WBAY, it served as the main studio until 1954 when an addition was built behind the main building. The auditorium has also been used for local theatrical productions. The station's newsroom is in the basement of the building in an area that originally held a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] pool and [[bowling]] alley. The WBAY building also served as the home of the WBAY radio stations (now WTAQ and [[WIXX]]), which were later purchased by [[Midwest Communications]] in the late 1970s, but remained in the building until Midwest built a combined Green Bay operations facility/company headquarters in 2007 and a news-weather sharing agreement was maintained between WBAY-TV and its former radio sisters for many years before it was discontinued in favor of an agreement with WLUK-TV.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WBAY-TV benefited from that network's [[NFL on CBS|coverage]] of [[National Football League]] games, primarily those of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The station carried its first Packers game a few months after signing on, and continued to air most Packers games until 1991 by virtue of CBS holding the rights to the Packers' conference, the [[National Football Conference]] (for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, Packers games moved to WFRV when that station switched to CBS). Packers games drew up to a 90 percent share of the audience during the team's championship era of the 1960s under [[Vince Lombardi]] (including the team's first two Super Bowl triumphs in [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], the former of which was also carried by then-NBC affiliate WFRV), and the station carried the team's coaches' show ''The Vince Lombardi Show.'' The station also originated the team's exhibition game coverage from the 1960s to 2002, with some exceptions. Main anchor Bill Jartz has been [[Lambeau Field]]'s [[public address|PA system]] announcer since the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. The station continued to air ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' Packer games originating from [[ESPN]] beginning with the move of ''MNF'' to cable starting with the 2006 until the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, [[WLUK-TV]], the Packers' primary home by virtue of [[Fox NFL|Fox presently holding the rights to the NFC]], acquired the syndication rights to the ESPN games under a multi-year agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> It was the first time that WBAY did not carry a Packers game during an NFL season in its 63-year history.\n\nIn 1974, WBAY was sold to [[Nationwide Communications]], which operated the station until 1993, when it was sold to [[Young Broadcasting]] along with its two ABC-affiliated sisters [[WATE-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WRIC-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nIn 1991, CBS purchased the assets of Midwest Television to acquire its long-dominant affiliate in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], [[WCCO-TV]]. Midwest also owned channel 2's longtime competitor, WFRV. CBS considered WBAY a strong affiliate, and tried to sell WFRV and their [[Escanaba, Michigan]]-based satellite station, [[WJMN-TV]], after the deal with Midwest closed. However, after FCC rules were relaxed at the time to allow one company to own more stations, the network decided to keep the two stations as a result and switched WFRV/WJMN to CBS in 1992 (CBS sold WFRV/WJMN to [[Liberty Media]] in 2007, the stations are now owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group]]).\n\nAfter it was announced that WFRV would join CBS, channel 2 then decided to take WFRV/WJMN's ABC affiliation; WBAY management insisted that the change take place on or near the anniversary of its sign-on date, March 17. Since that date fell on a Tuesday in 1992, WFRV and WBAY swapped networks on March 15, which fell on a Sunday.\n\nThe station formerly preempted the first hour of the ABC lineup (7-8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]) on Tuesday evenings during the football season to carry the local program ''Tuesday Night Touchback'', which was formerly known as ''Monday Night Countdown'' before it was moved in 2007 because of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and the departure of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from ABC (for most of the 2000s, the slot was among the lowest-rated on ABC's prime time schedule, as was the case with the pre-''MNF'' timeslot). Programs normally seen during that hour then aired later on early Wednesday morning after ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' during the football season. However, in November 2009, this was changed temporarily due to viewer feedback involving the pre-emption of the series premiere of ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', which forced that program to be aired after the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast; for the remainder of November, ''V'' aired at 7 p.m., while ''Tuesday Night Touchback'' preempted ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and aired before prime time in a truncated half-hour format. ''TNT'' has not aired since the 2011-12 season, and the station now airs ABC's Tuesday night's programming in pattern.\n\nWBAY was one of seven Young-owned stations whose management and operations were handled by [[Gray Television]] as part of a proposed takeover of Young Broadcasting by its secured creditors (a plan tentatively approved by a New York bankruptcy judge on July 22, 2009; it was approved in late April 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/451854-Gray_TV_Back_in_Business_With_Young_Stations.php|title=Gray TV Back in Business With Young Stations|publisher=}}</ref>). Under Gray management, this made it a semi-sister station in Wisconsin to [[NBC]] affiliates [[WMTV]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WEAU-TV]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WSAW-TV]] in [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. The Gray management agreement ended in 2012 as Young returned to some financial stability and the pursuit of a sale partner.\n\nIn late January 2010, the station stopped [[sign-on and sign-off|signing off]] during the early morning hours on Saturdays and Sundays, after a major transmitter problem forced the station to reconsider this mode of operation. WBAY was the last commercial station in the state to start broadcasting 24 hours a day daily, the former off-hours on WBAY's main signal are now taken up by a simulcast of WBAY-DT2. On June 6, 2013, Young Broadcasting announced that it would merge with [[Media General]]. The sale was approved on November 8, and consummated on November 12.<ref name=tvnc-youngmgcomplete>{{cite news|title=Media General, Young Now Officially One|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/71928/media-general-young-now-officially-one|accessdate=November 12, 2013|newspaper=TVNewsCheck|date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> At that time it became both Media General's first station in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest, and the company's northernmost asset.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, [[LIN Media]] entered into an agreement to merge with Media General in a $1.6 billion deal. Because LIN already owned Fox affiliate WLUK-TV and [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WCWF]] (channel 14), with WBAY and WLUK ranking among the four highest-rated stations in the Green Bay market in total day viewership, the companies were required to sell either WBAY or WLUK to another station owner in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit [[local marketing agreement|sharing agreements]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/tv-station-mega-merger-media-general-lin-set-1-6-billion-deal-1201141567/ TV Station Mega Merger: Media General, LIN Set $1.6 Billion Deal] from ''Variety'' (March 21, 2014)</ref><ref>[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-lin-media-general-merge-20140321,0,5277028.story Media General acquiring LIN Media for $1.6 billion], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 21, 2014.</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/74959/media-genlin-to-sellswap-in-five-markets Media Gen/LIN To Sell/Swap In Five Markets], ''TVNewsCheck'', March 21, 2014.</ref> On August 20, 2014, Media General announced that it would retain WBAY, trading WLUK and WCWF to [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] as part of several exchanges between other broadcast groups.<ref name=tvnc-wluksinclair>{{cite news|title=Media General, LIN Sell Stations In 5 Markets|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/78615/media-general-lin-sell-stations-in-5-markets|accessdate=August 20, 2014|work=TVNewsCheck|date=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]].<ref name=tvnc-mgnexstar>{{cite web|title=Nexstar-Media General: It's A Done Deal|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/91865/nexstarmedia-general-its-a-done-deal|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=January 27, 2016|date=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=nyt-mgnex>{{cite news|title=Nexstar Clinches Deal to Acquire Media General|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/business/dealbook/nexstar-clinches-deal-to-acquire-media-general.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 27, 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Because Nexstar already owned WFRV, it was required to sell that station or WBAY to another owner, though with the financial outlay Nexstar had invested into WFRV since its 2011 purchase, a swap for WBAY was unlikely despite the latter's first-place market ranking.\n\nOn June 3, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar would retain WFRV, selling WBAY to [[Gray Television]] for $270 million; this time in addition to the original Gray stations in the 2010 management deal, WBAY also became a sister station to new [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WZAW-LD]] in Wausau and [[WLUC-TV]] in Marquette (which had been an on-and-off sister station to WLUK over the years), which Gray acquired more recently.<ref name=tvnc-graymc>{{cite web|title=Gray Buying Two Nexstar Spinoffs For $270M|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/95259/gray-buying-two-nexstar-spinoffs-for-270m|website=TVNewsCheck|accessdate=June 3, 2016|date=June 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=bc-graymediageneral>{{cite news|first=Diana|last=Marszalek|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/gray-buys-nexstar-stations-green-bay-davenport/157035|title=Gray Buys Nexstar Stations in Green Bay, Davenport|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]], [[limited liability company|LLC]]|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 18, 2016}}</ref> The sale was closed on January 17, 2017, with a possible removal of WBAY on [[Dish Network]] due to Gray's previous [[retransmission consent]] deal ending averted with a renewal only hours later. The ownership transaction saw WBAY remove the Media General-mandated infotainment program ''Hollywood Today Live'' from their schedule (airing in late night on tape delay rather than in the mid-afternoon; the program was cancelled at the end of April) after March 3, along with Gray taking control of the station's website and mobile apps. With WBAY now having sister stations statewide, Gray began to distribute WBAY's Sunday night sports show, ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'', to their other stations with the start of the [[2017 NFL season]].\n\nThe station sponsors the yearly \"WBAY Boat Show\" and the \"WBAY [[recreational vehicle|RV]] and [[Camping]] Show\", both held in the winter months, formerly at the [[Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena|Brown County Arena]]/[[Shopko]] Hall (which will move to the new [[Brown County Expo Center|expo center in 2021]]), along with a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] door-to-door food drive (\"[[Scouting for Food]]\") in the fall, and the market's [[Toys for Tots]] effort with the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]].\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until the November 2010 launch of WGBA's [[TheCoolTV]] (currently [[MeTV]]) subchannel, it was the only commercial station in the market to utilize any [[digital subchannel]] services.\n\nIn late June 2010, WBAY-TV became the third commercial station in Green Bay to air syndicated programming (previously only the ABC schedule and [[ESPN|ESPN HD]] broadcasts of ''Monday Night Football'') in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. WBAY-TV also began to produce some outside advertising for local businesses and internal station promos in both HD and [[16:9]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] in mid-2010.\n\nSince July 2013, the station uses the [[Active Format Description|AFD #10]] flag to present all programming in [[letterbox]]ed [[widescreen]] for viewers watching on [[cable television]] and over-the-air through traditional 4:3 sets, with the same done for 2.2. and 2.3 within the same year; a re-imaging in November 2015 saw the station's graphical image adjusted to meet this presentation mode. The 2.1 signal had a [[secondary audio program|SAP audio channel]] added in late September 2013, allowing the station to transmit [[audio description]] and [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of ABC network programming, along with a 2017 upgrade to allow automated description of on-screen weather warning scrolls per new FCC rules.\n\n====First Alert Weather 24/7 (2.2)====\nWBAY operates '''First Alert Weather 24/7''' (formerly '''Stormcenter 2 24/7'''), a local weather channel that launched on August 7, 2005, and is carried on [[digital subchannel]] 2.2 and all local cable providers. The channel is produced in-house with no assistance from national services. It is fully [[automation|automated]], using the station's weather computers. 2.2 carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of [[Steven Avery]]'s murder trial daily throughout March 2007 in a rare break from format. The subchannel originally launched in the summer of 2004, carrying [[ABC News: Live|ABC News Now]]'s coverage of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic conventions]], along with that year's [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nAn upgrade in early March 2012 streamlined the channel's presentation to the station's HD upgrade. [[Mills Fleet Farm]] began to sponsor Stormcenter 2 and 24/7. Mills Fleet Farm's sponsorship of Stormcenter 2 24/7 ended in March 2016, and the weather department is currently sponsored by local home improvement company Tundraland. On July 23, 2014, a further upgrade was completed which converted the presentation to a widescreen format, allowing all the station's weather graphics and local advertising to be presented in their native form on 2.2.\n\nThe \"24/7\" title has been an occasional [[misnomer]] over-the-air due to WBAY going [[dark (broadcasting)|off the air]] for 3\u00bd hours on early Saturday and Sunday mornings until the winter of 2010, but since February 2008 the subchannel is also streamed through the station's website and weather app 24 hours a day. The subchannel now simulcasts on 2.1 on early Saturday and Sunday mornings since WBAY converted to a daily 24-hour schedule. In late May 2015, the subchannel resumed carrying E/I programming weekdays at 6 p.m. (consisting of six episodes per week of ''[[Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures]]''), where newscasts air most evenings on the main channel; WBAY-DT3 had aired six hours of E/I programming a week since 2013 to allow 2.2 to be a 24/7 service. In 2017, that programming was moved to 4 p.m. weekdays. Changes in the FCC's E/I rules in September 2019 allowed the use of the E/I allotments on WBAY's other four subchannels to count towards their fulfillment, allowing 2.2 to return to a true 24/7 service. It was rebranded on-air as \"First Alert Weather 24/7\" on November 11, 2019; however, it is still referenced as StormCenter 2 by a few viewers.\n====Circle (2.3)====\n[[File:WBAY LWN Logo.png|125px|thumb|right|Logo for WBAY's Live Well Network.]]\n\n=====Previous history=====\nIn January 2008, the station launched a third digital subchannel, '''WBAY RTV''' (formerly \"RTN 2-3\"), which aired a customized schedule of [[Retro Television Network]] programming for much of its history to avoid any conflicts with shows seen on RTV that were carried on other Green Bay stations, though with the network's June 2011 restructuring and loss of program rights it carried RTV's default feed with little deviation. Because of the network's technical and internal contractual problems, the subchannel ran a [[station identification]] on-screen at all times in case RTV ran into technical difficulties due to the network's ownership transfer in January 2009 where identification was not done on the network level; RTV also erroneously identified themselves as being on WBAY-DT2, which was never rectified through their entire run on the station.\n\nOn February 6, 2012 at 4 a.m., RTV was replaced with a [[480i]] [[letterbox]]ed feed of the [[Live Well Network]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|title=WBAY-TV Joins the Live Well Network|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=Station press release|accessdate=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129234052/http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|archive-date=January 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> as part of a group deal with the network and Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479562-Young_Broadcasting_Stations_Look_to_Live_Well.php|title=Young Broadcasting Stations Look to Live Well|publisher=}}</ref> The 24/7 ID was removed on this date due to station identification being inserted at the [[master control]] level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070824/GPG04/70824126/1978|title=GPG-Life&Style - Press Gazette Media - greenbaypressgazette.com|work=Press Gazette Media}}</ref> The station took heavy viewer criticism for replacing the network despite Retro TV having lost rights to spotlight programming in June 2011, and the near removal of the network from most of the Midwest due to other networks such as [[Antenna TV]] (carried by WLUK-DT2) and [[Me-TV]] (which is carried locally by WGBA-DT2) making carriage deals with former stations for the network; it no longer has any presence in Wisconsin. However, most transitions from Retro TV involved Antenna TV and MeTV, or a major netlet, without any issues, and at the time, RTV was rarely replaced by a lifestyle channel such as Live Well, as in this case.\n\nIn October 2013, Channel 2.3 was converted into a 16:9 widescreen presentation to fill the entire screen, as WBAY began to carry other college football games offered by ABC and ESPN on Saturday afternoons over 2.3 in addition to the main game offered by the network on 2.1, along with serving as the overflow channel for ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' coverage which in the past was fully preempted by the CP Telethon. In 2016 and 2017, WCWF carried the pre-empted NBA games to allow them to be carried on [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] and be presented in HD; since 2018, WBAY and ABC refer viewers to streaming those games via the [[WatchESPN|ESPN App]].\n\n=====Live Well Network=====\nOn January 9, 2015, the station announced that it would carry the new [[CBS]]/[[Weigel Broadcasting]] network [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] as a replacement for the Live Well Network, which originally was to end operations in mid-January.

Before the sale of the WBAY stations by the Norbertine Fathers, the telethon was [[simulcast]] over WBAY (AM) (later WGEE, now [[WTAQ]]) and WBAY-FM (now [[WIXX]]).\n\nWBAY's cerebral palsy telethon both pre-dated and succeeded the national telethon for United cerebral palsy, which ran on numerous stations nationwide from the mid-1970s to 1997.\n\n===Sunday Mass===\nThe station continues to air a [[Sunday Mass]] on Sunday mornings, as it has since signing on under the ownership of the Norbertine Fathers. After the sale of the station from them however, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay]] began producing the Mass at WBAY's studio. The Diocese provided a presider, [[choir]], liturgical coordinator, and producer while WBAY provided camera operators, a [[technical director]] and audio technician.\n\nOn December 27, 2009, the Diocese of Green Bay ended local production of the Mass, instead choosing to contract with the [http://thesundaymass.org/ Passionist Spiritual Center] to carry their nationally syndicated Mass program from [[Riverhead, New York]] by mutual agreement of the station and the Diocese, a transition that was planned two years before and took priority after the September 2009 death of the Diocese's communications director and Mass producer Tony Kuick.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thecompassnews.org/2009/12/diocese-will-no-longer-produce-tv-masses/|title=Diocese will no longer produce TV Masses; Televised Masses will now be produced by Passionist Communications|date=December 16, 2009|publisher=The Compass, [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay]]|accessdate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{expand section|further information on the history of WBAY's news department|date = November 2010}}\nWBAY-TV presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5 hours on weekdays and 3 hours on weekends), along with a half-hour sports-focused extension of the Sunday late news known as ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'' in football season (as mentioned above, that program airs statewide on Gray's stations as of September 2017). The station currently exchanges news stories with [[Hearst Television]]'s [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, in addition to airing that station's Wisconsin-focused [[Sunday morning talk show]], ''UpFront with Adrienne Pedersen''. Other sharing partners outside of its Gray sisters in Wisconsin are [[Quincy Newspapers]]' slate of ABC stations throughout the western part of the state, and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s ABC stations in [[KSTP-TV|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] and [[WDIO-DT|Duluth, Minnesota]]. The station utilizes the [[NEXRAD]] radar from the [[National Weather Service]] office just north of [[Austin Straubel International Airport]]. It formerly maintained an older self-owned Doppler unit until it mothballed the unit and removed its radar dome atop the station's downtown building in 2015.\n\n[[File:WBAY-TV News Logo.png|thumb|left|175px|WBAY's logo for \"Action 2 News\".]]\nWBAY's news operation is branded under the [[Action News]] title as ''Action 2 News'', and has used the title since the mid-1980s (with the ''HD'' suffix added upon its transition to high definition newscasts), predating its ABC affiliation. The station rarely refreshes its graphical imaging, having only done so three times since 1995, but has maintained long-term dominance in the local ratings for most of its history. Until September 2012, when WFRV debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, it was the only one in the market to have a late afternoon newscast in that timeslot. In late 2011, the station released mobile applications for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, followed by a separate weather app for both platforms in February 2013.\n\nBecause the station decided to maintain its noon newscast, WBAY-TV was among the few ABC affiliates that carried ''[[The Chew]]'' on a one-day delay (three days with the Friday edition) at 11 a.m. weekdays due to the network not offering an alternate feed for stations who wish to air the program at an earlier time, which was continued from a one-day delay on ''[[All My Children]]'' since 1992; this caused complaints among viewers, especially during the holidays when episodes timed to them aired after their occurrence, making the recipes presented in them superfluous. As of September 14, 2015, this was rectified, with ''The Chew'' moved to a same-day airing on tape at 2 p.m., and the delay will be maintained in September 2018 for the replacement show for ''The Chew'', ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke|GMA3: Strahan, Sara and Keke]]''. The only times of year the station does not run a newscast are on [[Christmas]] morning, during the CP telethon, and the evening before [[Easter]] when ABC runs ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' yearly (due to the film presentation ending after midnight).\n\nThe station began the process of upgrading to full HD production with a control room upgrade in the second quarter of 2011, a process hamstrung by the Young bankruptcy until Gray was able to begin operating the company's stations. The news department's conversion began on October 15 after that morning's newscast when construction began on a new set and the relocation of the older set (which had been in use with constant refreshing since the late 1980s) to another part of the building; the new set was completed by mid-December after a training/rehearsal period, using a common set design and graphics package that is used by all of the New Young stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/WBAY-TV-2|title=''Tomorrow, after Action 2 News This Morning-Weekend Edition, we will be dismantling this news set to make way for our HD improvements.

After all four local news operations established HD or widescreen presences, WBAY dropped the \"HD\" suffix from their brandings on June 2, 2014. On November 1, 2019, the station unveiled its first new slogan in decades, abandoning \"Coverage You Can Count On\" for the new tagline \"Your First Alert Station\" to tie into the [[push notification]]s sent from the station's news and weather [[mobile apps]]; likewise, weather is now branded as \"First Alert Weather\".\n\nAs of the fall of 2019, it also carries ''Full Court Press'', a national Sunday morning talk show from Gray featuring Appleton native [[Greta Van Susteren]], who regularly provides commentary to WBAY-TV regarding national and local politics as part of her role as the station group's chief national political analyst.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Rob Fowler (meteorologist)|Rob Fowler]] - meteorologist (1985-1987;

The station is owned by [[Gray Television]]. WBAY-TV's studios are located on South Jefferson Street in downtown Green Bay (across from the historic [[Brown County Courthouse (Wisconsin)|Brown County Courthouse]]), and its transmitter is located in [[Ledgeview, Wisconsin]] (shared with the transmitters of [[PBS Wisconsin]] station WPNE-TV and [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] station [[WPNE (FM)|WPNE]] (89.3 FM)).\n\n==History==\n[[File:WBAYTVMidwestRadioGreenBayWisconsinStudiosMay2007.jpg|thumb|left|Studios in 2007.]]\nWBAY-TV first signed on the air on March 17, 1953 as the second television station in Wisconsin, after [[WTMJ-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]]. It was originally owned by the [[Norbertine]] Order of Priests, whose abbey is in nearby [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]]. The priests run [[St. Norbert College]] in De Pere, and already operated WBAY radio (1360 AM, now [[WTAQ]]) in Green Bay and [[WHBY]] radio in [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. Like WTMJ when that station started in 1947, as the only station in the market, WBAY originally carried programming from all four networks of the day \u2013 channel 2 was a primary [[CBS]] affiliate with secondary affiliations with [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]].\n\nNBC moved to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]]'s WMBV-TV (channel 11, now [[WLUK-TV]]) when it signed on in 1954, with WNAM-TV (channel 42, now [[WFRV-TV]] Channel 5) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] taking the ABC affiliation upon its 1955 debut. With the shutdown of DuMont in 1956, WBAY was left as an exclusive CBS affiliate, and remained the only station licensed to Green Bay proper until the 1959 relocation of WLUK to the city. Channel 2 upgraded its transmitter and began broadcasting network programming in color around 1959; locally produced programs were broadcast in color starting in 1966.\n\nThe station's studios in downtown Green Bay were built in 1924 as a former [[Knights of Columbus]] clubhouse and later was turned into a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] during the [[Great Depression]] when the Norbertines took over the building. The former gymnasium/auditorium is now called the WBAY Auditorium and is used as the studio for the station's [[cerebral palsy]] [[telethon]]. During the early years of WBAY, it served as the main studio until 1954 when an addition was built behind the main building. The auditorium has also been used for local theatrical productions. The station's newsroom is in the basement of the building in an area that originally held a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] pool and [[bowling]] alley. The WBAY building also served as the home of the WBAY radio stations (now WTAQ and [[WIXX]]), which were later purchased by [[Midwest Communications]] in the late 1970s, but remained in the building until Midwest built a combined Green Bay operations facility/company headquarters in 2007 and a news-weather sharing agreement was maintained between WBAY-TV and its former radio sisters for many years before it was discontinued in favor of an agreement with WLUK-TV.\n\nAs a CBS affiliate, WBAY-TV benefited from that network's [[NFL on CBS|coverage]] of [[National Football League]] games, primarily those of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The station carried its first Packers game a few months after signing on, and continued to air most Packers games until 1991 by virtue of CBS holding the rights to the Packers' conference, the [[National Football Conference]] (for the 1992 and 1993 seasons, Packers games moved to WFRV when that station switched to CBS). Packers games drew up to a 90 percent share of the audience during the team's championship era of the 1960s under [[Vince Lombardi]] (including the team's first two Super Bowl triumphs in [[Super Bowl I]] and [[Super Bowl II]], the former of which was also carried by then-NBC affiliate WFRV), and the station carried the team's coaches' show ''The Vince Lombardi Show.'' The station also originated the team's exhibition game coverage from the 1960s to 2002, with some exceptions. Main anchor Bill Jartz has been [[Lambeau Field]]'s [[public address|PA system]] announcer since the start of the 2005\u20132006 season. The station continued to air ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' Packer games originating from [[ESPN]] beginning with the move of ''MNF'' to cable starting with the 2006 until the 2015 season. For the 2016 season, [[WLUK-TV]], the Packers' primary home by virtue of [[Fox NFL|Fox presently holding the rights to the NFC]], acquired the syndication rights to the ESPN games under a multi-year agreement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fox11online.com/sports/packers-and-nfl/fox-11-to-air-hall-of-fame-game-packers-mnf-games|title=FOX 11 to air Hall of Fame Game, Packers MNF games|date=July 6, 2016|publisher=WLUK-TV|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref> It was the first time that WBAY did not carry a Packers game during an NFL season in its 63-year history.\n\nIn 1974, WBAY was sold to [[Nationwide Communications]], which operated the station until 1993, when it was sold to [[Young Broadcasting]] along with its two ABC-affiliated sisters [[WATE-TV]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WRIC-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nIn 1991, CBS purchased the assets of Midwest Television to acquire its long-dominant affiliate in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]], [[WCCO-TV]]. Midwest also owned channel 2's longtime competitor, WFRV. CBS considered WBAY a strong affiliate, and tried to sell WFRV and their [[Escanaba, Michigan]]-based satellite station, [[WJMN-TV]], after the deal with Midwest closed. However, after FCC rules were relaxed at the time to allow one company to own more stations, the network decided to keep the two stations as a result and switched WFRV/WJMN to CBS in 1992 (CBS sold WFRV/WJMN to [[Liberty Media]] in 2007, the stations are now owned by the [[Nexstar Media Group]]).\n\nAfter it was announced that WFRV would join CBS, channel 2 then decided to take WFRV/WJMN's ABC affiliation; WBAY management insisted that the change take place on or near the anniversary of its sign-on date, March 17. Since that date fell on a Tuesday in 1992, WFRV and WBAY swapped networks on March 15, which fell on a Sunday.\n\nThe station formerly preempted the first hour of the ABC lineup (7-8 p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]) on Tuesday evenings during the football season to carry the local program ''Tuesday Night Touchback'', which was formerly known as ''Monday Night Countdown'' before it was moved in 2007 because of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and the departure of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' from ABC (for most of the 2000s, the slot was among the lowest-rated on ABC's prime time schedule, as was the case with the pre-''MNF'' timeslot). Programs normally seen during that hour then aired later on early Wednesday morning after ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' during the football season. However, in November 2009, this was changed temporarily due to viewer feedback involving the pre-emption of the series premiere of ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', which forced that program to be aired after the Saturday 10 p.m. newscast; for the remainder of November, ''V'' aired at 7 p.m., while ''Tuesday Night Touchback'' preempted ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' and aired before prime time in a truncated half-hour format. ''TNT'' has not aired since the 2011-12 season, and the station now airs ABC's Tuesday night's programming in pattern.\n\nWBAY was one of seven Young-owned stations whose management and operations were handled by [[Gray Television]] as part of a proposed takeover of Young Broadcasting by its secured creditors (a plan tentatively approved by a New York bankruptcy judge on July 22, 2009; it was approved in late April 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/451854-Gray_TV_Back_in_Business_With_Young_Stations.php|title=Gray TV Back in Business With Young Stations|publisher=}}</ref>). Under Gray management, this made it a semi-sister station in Wisconsin to [[NBC]] affiliates [[WMTV]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] and [[WEAU-TV]] in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], and [[CBS]] affiliate [[WSAW-TV]] in [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]]. The Gray management agreement ended in 2012 as Young returned to some financial stability and the pursuit of a sale partner.\n\nIn late January 2010, the station stopped [[sign-on and sign-off|signing off]] during the early morning hours on Saturdays and Sundays, after a major transmitter problem forced the station to reconsider this mode of operation. WBAY was the last commercial station in the state to start broadcasting 24 hours a day daily, the former off-hours on WBAY's main signal are now taken up by a simulcast of WBAY-DT2.

The ownership transaction saw WBAY remove the Media General-mandated infotainment program ''Hollywood Today Live'' from their schedule (airing in late night on tape delay rather than in the mid-afternoon; the program was cancelled at the end of April) after March 3, along with Gray taking control of the station's website and mobile apps. With WBAY now having sister stations statewide, Gray began to distribute WBAY's Sunday night sports show, ''Sunday Sports Night: Cover 2'', to their other stations with the start of the [[2017 NFL season]].\n\nThe station sponsors the yearly \"WBAY Boat Show\" and the \"WBAY [[recreational vehicle|RV]] and [[Camping]] Show\", both held in the winter months, formerly at the [[Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena|Brown County Arena]]/[[Shopko]] Hall (which will move to the new [[Brown County Expo Center|expo center in 2021]]), along with a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] door-to-door food drive (\"[[Scouting for Food]]\") in the fall, and the market's [[Toys for Tots]] effort with the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]].\n\n==Digital television==\n===Digital channels===\nThe station's digital signal is [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until the November 2010 launch of WGBA's [[TheCoolTV]] (currently [[MeTV]]) subchannel, it was the only commercial station in the market to utilize any [[digital subchannel]] services.\n\nIn late June 2010, WBAY-TV became the third commercial station in Green Bay to air syndicated programming (previously only the ABC schedule and [[ESPN|ESPN HD]] broadcasts of ''Monday Night Football'') in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. WBAY-TV also began to produce some outside advertising for local businesses and internal station promos in both HD and [[16:9]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] in mid-2010.\n\nSince July 2013, the station uses the [[Active Format Description|AFD #10]] flag to present all programming in [[letterbox]]ed [[widescreen]] for viewers watching on [[cable television]] and over-the-air through traditional 4:3 sets, with the same done for 2.2. and 2.3 within the same year; a re-imaging in November 2015 saw the station's graphical image adjusted to meet this presentation mode. The 2.1 signal had a [[secondary audio program|SAP audio channel]] added in late September 2013, allowing the station to transmit [[audio description]] and [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish-language]] [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] of ABC network programming, along with a 2017 upgrade to allow automated description of on-screen weather warning scrolls per new FCC rules.\n\n====First Alert Weather 24/7 (2.2)====\nWBAY operates '''First Alert Weather 24/7''' (formerly '''Stormcenter 2 24/7'''), a local weather channel that launched on August 7, 2005, and is carried on [[digital subchannel]] 2.2 and all local cable providers. The channel is produced in-house with no assistance from national services. It is fully [[automation|automated]], using the station's weather computers. 2.2 carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of [[Steven Avery]]'s murder trial daily throughout March 2007 in a rare break from format. The subchannel originally launched in the summer of 2004, carrying [[ABC News: Live|ABC News Now]]'s coverage of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican]] and [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic conventions]], along with that year's [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election]].\n\nAn upgrade in early March 2012 streamlined the channel's presentation to the station's HD upgrade. [[Mills Fleet Farm]] began to sponsor Stormcenter 2 and 24/7. Mills Fleet Farm's sponsorship of Stormcenter 2 24/7 ended in March 2016, and the weather department is currently sponsored by local home improvement company Tundraland. On July 23, 2014, a further upgrade was completed which converted the presentation to a widescreen format, allowing all the station's weather graphics and local advertising to be presented in their native form on 2.2.\n\nThe \"24/7\" title has been an occasional [[misnomer]] over-the-air due to WBAY going [[dark (broadcasting)|off the air]] for 3\u00bd hours on early Saturday and Sunday mornings until the winter of 2010, but since February 2008 the subchannel is also streamed through the station's website and weather app 24 hours a day. The subchannel now simulcasts on 2.1 on early Saturday and Sunday mornings since WBAY converted to a daily 24-hour schedule. In late May 2015, the subchannel resumed carrying E/I programming weekdays at 6 p.m. (consisting of six episodes per week of ''[[Jack Hanna's Animal Adventures]]''), where newscasts air most evenings on the main channel; WBAY-DT3 had aired six hours of E/I programming a week since 2013 to allow 2.2 to be a 24/7 service. In 2017, that programming was moved to 4 p.m. weekdays. Changes in the FCC's E/I rules in September 2019 allowed the use of the E/I allotments on WBAY's other four subchannels to count towards their fulfillment, allowing 2.2 to return to a true 24/7 service. It was rebranded on-air as \"First Alert Weather 24/7\" on November 11, 2019; however, it is still referenced as StormCenter 2 by a few viewers.\n====Circle (2.3)====\n[[File:WBAY LWN Logo.png|125px|thumb|right|Logo for WBAY's Live Well Network.]]\n\n=====Previous history=====\nIn January 2008, the station launched a third digital subchannel, '''WBAY RTV''' (formerly \"RTN 2-3\"), which aired a customized schedule of [[Retro Television Network]] programming for much of its history to avoid any conflicts with shows seen on RTV that were carried on other Green Bay stations, though with the network's June 2011 restructuring and loss of program rights it carried RTV's default feed with little deviation. Because of the network's technical and internal contractual problems, the subchannel ran a [[station identification]] on-screen at all times in case RTV ran into technical difficulties due to the network's ownership transfer in January 2009 where identification was not done on the network level; RTV also erroneously identified themselves as being on WBAY-DT2, which was never rectified through their entire run on the station.\n\nOn February 6, 2012 at 4 a.m., RTV was replaced with a [[480i]] [[letterbox]]ed feed of the [[Live Well Network]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|title=WBAY-TV Joins the Live Well Network|date=January 27, 2012|publisher=Station press release|accessdate=January 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129234052/http://www.wbay.com/story/16619010/wbay-tv-joins-the-live-well-network|archive-date=January 29, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> as part of a group deal with the network and Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/479562-Young_Broadcasting_Stations_Look_to_Live_Well.php|title=Young Broadcasting Stations Look to Live Well|publisher=}}</ref> The 24/7 ID was removed on this date due to station identification being inserted at the [[master control]] level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070824/GPG04/70824126/1978|title=GPG-Life&Style - Press Gazette Media - greenbaypressgazette.com|work=Press Gazette Media}}</ref> The station took heavy viewer criticism for replacing the network despite Retro TV having lost rights to spotlight programming in June 2011, and the near removal of the network from most of the Midwest due to other networks such as [[Antenna TV]] (carried by WLUK-DT2) and [[Me-TV]] (which is carried locally by WGBA-DT2) making carriage deals with former stations for the network; it no longer has any presence in Wisconsin. However, most transitions from Retro TV involved Antenna TV and MeTV, or a major netlet, without any issues, and at the time, RTV was rarely replaced by a lifestyle channel such as Live Well, as in this case.\n\nIn October 2013, Channel 2.3 was converted into a 16:9 widescreen presentation to fill the entire screen, as WBAY began to carry other college football games offered by ABC and ESPN on Saturday afternoons over 2.3 in addition to the main game offered by the network on 2.1, along with serving as the overflow channel for ''[[NBA on ABC]]'' coverage which in the past was fully preempted by the CP Telethon. In 2016 and 2017, WCWF carried the pre-empted NBA games to allow them to be carried on [[direct-broadcast satellite television|satellite]] and be presented in HD; since 2018, WBAY and ABC refer viewers to streaming those games via the [[WatchESPN|ESPN App]].\n\n=====Live Well Network=====\nOn January 9, 2015, the station announced that it would carry the new [[CBS]]/[[Weigel Broadcasting]] network [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]] as a replacement for the Live Well Network, which originally was to end operations in mid-January.

This marked Ion's return to Green Bay for the first time since 2005, when [[WCWF]] (originally WPXG, later WIWB) discontinued carrying all programming from the network in overnight hours after the station was purchased from Paxson Communications in 1999 and converted to an affiliate of [[The WB]]. Viewers in the Green Bay market still had cable and satellite coverage of Ion's national feed in the 10-year interregnum. Due to duplication rules involving [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]'s Ion O&O [[WPXE-TV]] in the Milwaukee market and [[Antigo, Wisconsin|Antigo]]-licensed O&O [[WTPX-TV]] in the Wausau market, the carriage of WBAY's Ion subchannel was discontinued on some systems on the outer areas of the Green Bay market which have those stations available to them from Spectrum.\n=====2.6 from December 2019\u2013present=====\nOn December 2, 2019, a simulcast launched on WBAY-DT6, which became the network's permanent home on the WBAY channel lineup on December 16 to make way for Circle on WBAY-DT3.\n\n===Analog-to-digital conversion===\nWBAY-TV shut down its analog signal, over [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States [[Digital television transition in the United States|transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts]] under federal mandate.

Currently the telethon is a local-only effort, using local broadcasters and people to host the broadcast, and the funds raised benefit the local organization, cerebral palsy, Inc. Before the sale of the WBAY stations by the Norbertine Fathers, the telethon was [[simulcast]] over WBAY (AM) (later WGEE, now [[WTAQ]]) and WBAY-FM (now [[WIXX]]).\n\nWBAY's cerebral palsy telethon both pre-dated and succeeded the national telethon for United cerebral palsy, which ran on numerous stations nationwide from the mid-1970s to 1997.\n\n===Sunday Mass===\nThe station continues to air a [[Sunday Mass]] on Sunday mornings, as it has since signing on under the ownership of the Norbertine Fathers.

The station currently exchanges news stories with [[Hearst Television]]'s [[WISN-TV]] in Milwaukee, in addition to airing that station's Wisconsin-focused [[Sunday morning talk show]], ''UpFront with Adrienne Pedersen''. Other sharing partners outside of its Gray sisters in Wisconsin are [[Quincy Newspapers]]' slate of ABC stations throughout the western part of the state, and [[Hubbard Broadcasting]]'s ABC stations in [[KSTP-TV|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] and [[WDIO-DT|Duluth, Minnesota]]. The station utilizes the [[NEXRAD]] radar from the [[National Weather Service]] office just north of [[Austin Straubel International Airport]]. It formerly maintained an older self-owned Doppler unit until it mothballed the unit and removed its radar dome atop the station's downtown building in 2015.\n\n[[File:WBAY-TV News Logo.png|thumb|left|175px|WBAY's logo for \"Action 2 News\".]]\nWBAY's news operation is branded under the [[Action News]] title as ''Action 2 News'', and has used the title since the mid-1980s (with the ''HD'' suffix added upon its transition to high definition newscasts), predating its ABC affiliation. The station rarely refreshes its graphical imaging, having only done so three times since 1995, but has maintained long-term dominance in the local ratings for most of its history. Until September 2012, when WFRV debuted its 4 p.m. newscast, it was the only one in the market to have a late afternoon newscast in that timeslot. In late 2011, the station released mobile applications for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, followed by a separate weather app for both platforms in February 2013.\n\nBecause the station decided to maintain its noon newscast, WBAY-TV was among the few ABC affiliates that carried ''[[The Chew]]'' on a one-day delay (three days with the Friday edition) at 11 a.m. weekdays due to the network not offering an alternate feed for stations who wish to air the program at an earlier time, which was continued from a one-day delay on ''[[All My Children]]'' since 1992; this caused complaints among viewers, especially during the holidays when episodes timed to them aired after their occurrence, making the recipes presented in them superfluous. As of September 14, 2015, this was rectified, with ''The Chew'' moved to a same-day airing on tape at 2 p.m., and the delay will be maintained in September 2018 for the replacement show for ''The Chew'', ''[[Strahan, Sara and Keke|GMA3: Strahan, Sara and Keke]]''. The only times of year the station does not run a newscast are on [[Christmas]] morning, during the CP telethon, and the evening before [[Easter]] when ABC runs ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' yearly (due to the film presentation ending after midnight).\n\nThe station began the process of upgrading to full HD production with a control room upgrade in the second quarter of 2011, a process hamstrung by the Young bankruptcy until Gray was able to begin operating the company's stations. The news department's conversion began on October 15 after that morning's newscast when construction began on a new set and the relocation of the older set (which had been in use with constant refreshing since the late 1980s) to another part of the building; the new set was completed by mid-December after a training/rehearsal period, using a common set design and graphics package that is used by all of the New Young stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/WBAY-TV-2|title=''Tomorrow, after Action 2 News This Morning-Weekend Edition, we will be dismantling this news set to make way for our HD improvements.

After all four local news operations established HD or widescreen presences, WBAY dropped the \"HD\" suffix from their brandings on June 2, 2014. On November 1, 2019, the station unveiled its first new slogan in decades, abandoning \"Coverage You Can Count On\" for the new tagline \"Your First Alert Station\" to tie into the [[push notification]]s sent from the station's news and weather [[mobile apps]]; likewise, weather is now branded as \"First Alert Weather\".\n\nAs of the fall of 2019, it also carries ''Full Court Press'', a national Sunday morning talk show from Gray featuring Appleton native [[Greta Van Susteren]], who regularly provides commentary to WBAY-TV regarding national and local politics as part of her role as the station group's chief national political analyst.\n\n===Notable former on-air staff===\n* [[Rob Fowler (meteorologist)|Rob Fowler]] - meteorologist (1985-1987; now at [[WCBD]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rob-fowler/17/721/ab|title=Rob Fowler|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Jim Hill (American football)|Jim Hill]] - sports contributor (1972-1974, now with [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]])<ref>TV Guide magazine, Wisconsin Edition dated September 23\u201329, 1972, WBAY-TV ad on page A-40</ref>\n* [[Orion Samuelson]] - farm director (1950s, hosted programs on [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] radio in Chicago, syndicated television program ''[[U.S. Farm Report]]'', and ''This Week in Agribusiness'' on [[RFD-TV]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiohof.org/newstalk/orionsamuelson.html|title=Orion Samuelson biography|publisher=[[Radio Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=September 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123124228/http://www.radiohof.org/newstalk/orionsamuelson.html|archive-date=January 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Ben Tracy]] - reporter (now with [[CBS News]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/11/broadcasts/main3699611.shtml|title=Ben Tracy biography|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=September 26, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Michelle Tuzee]] (now at [[KABC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/bio?section=resources/inside_station/newsteam&id=5744048 |title=Michelle Tuzee biography |publisher=[[KABC-TV]] |accessdate=September 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127035511/http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/bio?section=resources%2Finside_station%2Fnewsteam&id=5744048 |archivedate=November 27, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://wbay.com/ Official website]\n*{{TVQ|WBAY-TV}}\n*{{BIA|WBAY|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Green Bay TV}}\n{{Wisconsin TV}}\n{{Other Wisconsin Stations}}\n{{Gray TV}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wbay-Tv}}\n[[Category:ABC network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Gray Television]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1953]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Green Bay, Wisconsin|BAY-TV]]\n[[Category:Nationwide Communications]]\n[[Category:National Football League primary television stations]]\n[[Category:Green Bay Packers broadcasters]]\n[[Category:Circle (TV network) affiliates]]\n[[Category:Ion Television subchannel-only affiliates]]\n[[Category:Heroes & Icons affiliates]]\n[[Category:Start TV affiliates]]\n[[Category:Former CBS network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Former NBC network affiliates]]\n", "name_user": "Mrschimpf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTelethon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBAY-TV"}
