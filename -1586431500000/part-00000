The swift response of the [[Australian Defence Force]] was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region. Only one indirect death was record as a result of the cyclone.\n\nCyclone Larry was a direct and primary cause of the widely reported and dramatic surge in banana prices in Australia.

It struck Innisfail at 7am on 20 March 2006, with the eye of the storm passing over the town.\n\nSevere structural damage occurred over the entirety of the township, the main damage being a portion of houses losing roofs and windows and the cyclone rendered even more homes structurally unsound. Power was effectively eliminated from the town and generators became a luxury in many homes. [[Potable water|Clean drinking water]] was also compromised in many homes leading to health fears. The swift response of the [[Australian Defence Force]] was praised by many and the cleanup campaign they orchestrated allowed for total utilities restoration within 3 weeks. Severe damage was done to crops and plantations (mainly bananas) which had a serious economic impact on the region.

It was one of the first schools in the region. In 1930, it broadened its scope to become a co-educational secondary school, and in 1932, it was renamed Birzeit Higher School. In 1942, the name was changed to Birzeit College. In 1953, a freshman higher education class was incorporated, followed by a sophomore class in 1961.<ref name=\"birzeit1\"/>\n\nThe year 1948 was a turning point in the history of Birzeit College. By the spring, the political situation looked precarious, and Birzeit administrators worried that the school year which normally ended in June would be interrupted by events connected with the withdrawal of British forces and the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] lasting since 1917. The administrators decided to complete the semester curriculum by April, scheduling the graduation ceremony for April 30, 1948 and to be held under the auspices of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]], the chief commander of the [[Army of the Holy War]]. However, he was killed on April 8 at the battle of [[Al-Qastal, Jerusalem|Al-Qastal]] by the Jewish paramilitary force [[Haganah]], who were defending positions on that hill on the outskirts of [[Jerusalem]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1975, Birzeit College changed its name to Birzeit University.

It was one of the first schools in the region. In 1930, it broadened its scope to become a co-educational secondary school, and in 1932, it was renamed Birzeit Higher School. In 1942, the name was changed to Birzeit College. In 1953, a freshman higher education class was incorporated, followed by a sophomore class in 1961.<ref name=\"birzeit1\"/>\n\nThe year 1948 was a turning point in the history of Birzeit College. By the spring, the political situation looked precarious, and Birzeit administrators worried that the school year which normally ended in June would be interrupted by events connected with the withdrawal of British forces and the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] lasting since 1917. The administrators decided to complete the semester curriculum by April, scheduling the graduation ceremony for April 30, 1948 and to be held under the auspices of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]], the chief commander of the [[Army of the Holy War]]. However, he was killed on April 8 at the battle of [[Al-Qastal, Jerusalem|Al-Qastal]] by the Jewish paramilitary force [[Haganah]], who were defending positions on that hill on the outskirts of [[Jerusalem]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1975, Birzeit College changed its name to Birzeit University.

It is a member of the small [[Dyirbalic languages|Dyirbalic]] branch of the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages|Pama\u2013Nyungan family]]. It possesses many outstanding features that have made it well known among [[linguistics|linguist]]s.\n\nIn the years since the Dyirbal grammar by [[Robert M. W. Dixon|Robert Dixon]] was published in 1972, Dyirbal has steadily moved closer to [[language death|extinction]] as younger community members have failed to learn it.<ref>Schmidt, A: \"Young People's Dyirbal: An Example of Language Death from Australia\" (Cambridge University Press, 1985)</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nDyirbal dialects of the [[Mamu people|Mamu]] people are Wa\u027dibara, Dulgubara, Bagi\u027dgabara, Dyi\u027dibara, Mandubara.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nDyirbal has only four [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] for the [[stop consonant|stop]] and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], whereas most other Australian Aboriginal languages have six. This is because Dyirbal lacks the [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]/[[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] split typically found in these languages. Like the majority of Australian languages, it does not make a distinction between voiced consonants (such as b, d, g, etc.) and voiceless consonants (the corresponding p, t, and k, etc. respectively). Like [[Pinyin]], standard Dyirbal [[orthography]] uses voiced consonants, which seem to be preferred by speakers of most Australian languages since the sounds (which can often be semi-voiced) are closer to English semi-voiced ''b, d, g'' than aspirated ''p, t, k''.\n\nThe Dyirbal [[vowel]] system is typical of Australia, with three vowels: {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, though {{IPA|/u/}} is realised as {{IPA|[o]}} in certain environments and {{IPA|/a/}} can be realised as {{IPA|[e]}}, also depending on the environment in which the [[phoneme]] appears.{{elucidate|If we know which environments these are, we should give them.|date=February 2015}} Thus the actual inventory of sounds is greater than the inventory of phonemes would suggest. Stress always falls on the first syllable of a word and usually on subsequent odd-numbered syllables except the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], which is always unstressed. The result of this is that consecutive stressed syllables do not occur.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Peripheral consonant|Peripheral]]\n!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|w}}||{{IPA|j}}||{{IPA|l}}\n|\u027b\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe language is best known for its system of [[noun class]]es, numbering four in total. They tend to be divided among the following [[semantic]] lines:\n\n* I \u2013 most animate objects, men\n* II \u2013 women, [[water]], [[fire]], [[violence]], and exceptional [[animal]]s<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=George Lakoff |last=Lakoff |first=George |year=1990 |title=[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=5 }}</ref>\n* III \u2013 edible [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s\n* IV \u2013 miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)\n\nThe class usually labelled \"feminine\" (II) inspired the title of [[George Lakoff]]'s book ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''. Some [[Linguistics|linguists]] distinguish between such systems of classification and the [[grammatical gender|gendered division]] of items into the categories of \"feminine\", \"masculine\" and (sometimes) \"neuter\" that is found in, for example, many [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nDyirbal shows a [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] system. Sentences with a first or second person pronoun have their [[verb argument]]s marked for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] in a pattern that mimics [[nominative\u2013accusative language]]s. That is, the first or second person pronoun appears in the least marked case when it is the subject (regardless of the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of the verb), and in the most marked case when it is the direct object. Thus Dyirbal is [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] accusative in the first and second persons, but morphologically ergative elsewhere; and it is still always [[syntax|syntactically]] ergative.\n\n==Taboo==\nThere used to be in place a highly complex ''[[taboo]]'' system in Dyirbal culture. A speaker was completely forbidden from speaking with his/her mother-in-law, child-in-law, father's sister's child or mother's brother's child, and from approaching or looking directly at these people.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1972). The Dyirbal language of north Queensland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> A person is forbidden from speaking with their [[cross-cousin]] of the opposite sex due to the fact that those relatives are of the section from which an individual must marry, but are too close of kin to choose as a spouse so the avoidance might be present on the grounds of indicating who is sexually unavailable.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nFurthermore, because marriage typically takes place a generation above or below, the cross-cousin of the opposite sex often is a potential mother-in-law or father-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1989\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1989). The Dyirbal kinship system. Oceania , 59(4), 245\u2013268.</ref> In addition, when within hearing range of taboo relatives a person was required to use a specialized and complex form of the language with essentially the same [[phonemes]] and [[grammar]], but with a [[lexicon]] that shared no words with the non-taboo language except for four lexical items referring to grandparents on the mother and father's side.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1990\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1990). The origin of \"mother-in-law vocabulary\" in two Australian languages. Anthropological Linguistics , 32(1/2), 1\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe taboo relationship is reciprocal. Thus, an individual is not allowed to speak with one's own mother-in-law and it is equally taboo for the mother-in-law to speak with her son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> This relationship is also prevalent among both genders such that a daughter-in-law is forbidden to speak to directly or approach her father-in-law and vice versa.  This taboo exists, although it is not as strongly enforced, between members of the same sex such that a male individual should use the respectful style of speech in the presence of his father-in-law, but the father-in-law can decide whether or not to use the everyday style of speech or the respectful style in the presence of his son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nThe specialized and complex form of the language is known as the Dyal\u014buy and is used in the presence of the taboo relatives whereas a form referred to in most dialects as Guwal is used in all other circumstances.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> The Dyal\u014buy has one fourth of the amount of lexical items as the everyday language which reduces the semantic content in actual communication in the presence of a taboo relative.<ref>Silverstein, M. (1976). Shifters, linguistic categories, and cultural description. In K. H. Basso & H. A. Selby (Eds.), Meaning in Anthropology (pp. 11\u201355). Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.</ref> For example, in Dyal\u014buy the verb 'to ask' is [ba\u014barrmba-l]. In Guwal, 'to ask' is [\u014banba-l], 'to invite someone over' is [yumba-l], 'to invite someone to accompany one' is [bunma-l] and 'to keep asking after having already been told' is [gunji-y]. There are no correspondences to the other 3 verbs of Guwal in Dyal\u014buy.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1990\"/>\n\nTo get around this limitation, Dyirbal speakers use many syntactic and semantic tricks to make do with a minimal vocabulary which reveals a lot to linguists about the semantic nature of Dyirbal. For example, Guwal makes use of lexical [[causative]]s, such as transitive ''bana-'' \"break\" and intransitive ''gaynyja-'' \"break\" (similar to English ''be dead/kill'', ''lie/lay''). Since Dyirbal has fewer lexemes, a morpheme ''-rri-'' is used as an intransitive derivational suffix. Thus the Dyal\u014bguy equivalents of the two words above are transitive ''yuwa'' and intransitive ''yuwa-rri-''.<ref>Dixon, R.M.W. (2000). \"A Typology of Causatives: Form, Syntax, and Meaning\".

Cambridge University Press. pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe lexical items found in Dyal\u014buy are mainly derived from three sources: \"borrowings from the everyday register of neighboring dialects or languages, the creation of new [Dyal\u014buy] forms by phonological deformation of lexemes from the language's own everyday style, and the borrowing of terms that were already in the [Dyal\u014buy] style of a neighboring language or dialect\".<ref>Evans, N. (2003). Context, culture, and structuration in the languages of Australia. Annual Review of Anthropology, 32, 13\u201340.</ref>\n\nAn example of borrowing between dialects is the word for sun in the Yidin and Ngadyan dialects. In Yidin, the Guwal style word for sun is [bu\u014ban], and this same word is also the Dyal\u014buy style of the word for sun in the Ngadyan dialect.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> It is hypothesized that children of Dyirbal tribes were expected to acquire the Dyal\u014buy speech style years following their acquisition of the everyday speech style from their cross cousins who would speak in Dyal\u014buy in their presence. By the onset of puberty, the child probably spoke Dyal\u014buy fluently and was able to use it in the appropriate contexts.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1989\"/> This phenomenon, commonly called [[mother-in-law languages]], was common in indigenous Australian languages. It existed until about 1930, when the taboo system fell out of use.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Robert M. W.|authorlink=Robert M. W.

It is a member of the small [[Dyirbalic languages|Dyirbalic]] branch of the [[Pama\u2013Nyungan languages|Pama\u2013Nyungan family]]. It possesses many outstanding features that have made it well known among [[linguistics|linguist]]s.\n\nIn the years since the Dyirbal grammar by [[Robert M. W. Dixon|Robert Dixon]] was published in 1972, Dyirbal has steadily moved closer to [[language death|extinction]] as younger community members have failed to learn it.<ref>Schmidt, A: \"Young People's Dyirbal: An Example of Language Death from Australia\" (Cambridge University Press, 1985)</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nDyirbal dialects of the [[Mamu]] people are Wa\u027dibara, Dulgubara, Bagi\u027dgabara, Dyi\u027dibara, Mandubara.\n\n==Phonology==\n\nDyirbal has only four [[Place of articulation|places of articulation]] for the [[stop consonant|stop]] and [[nasal consonant|nasals]], whereas most other Australian Aboriginal languages have six. This is because Dyirbal lacks the [[Dental consonant|dental]]/[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]/[[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] split typically found in these languages. Like the majority of Australian languages, it does not make a distinction between voiced consonants (such as b, d, g, etc.) and voiceless consonants (the corresponding p, t, and k, etc. respectively). Like [[Pinyin]], standard Dyirbal [[orthography]] uses voiced consonants, which seem to be preferred by speakers of most Australian languages since the sounds (which can often be semi-voiced) are closer to English semi-voiced ''b, d, g'' than aspirated ''p, t, k''.\n\nThe Dyirbal [[vowel]] system is typical of Australia, with three vowels: {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, though {{IPA|/u/}} is realised as {{IPA|[o]}} in certain environments and {{IPA|/a/}} can be realised as {{IPA|[e]}}, also depending on the environment in which the [[phoneme]] appears.{{elucidate|If we know which environments these are, we should give them.|date=February 2015}} Thus the actual inventory of sounds is greater than the inventory of phonemes would suggest. Stress always falls on the first syllable of a word and usually on subsequent odd-numbered syllables except the [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultima]], which is always unstressed. The result of this is that consecutive stressed syllables do not occur.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!rowspan=2|\n!colspan=2| [[Peripheral consonant|Peripheral]]\n!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|w}}||{{IPA|j}}||{{IPA|l}}\n|\u027b\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe language is best known for its system of [[noun class]]es, numbering four in total. They tend to be divided among the following [[semantic]] lines:\n\n* I \u2013 most animate objects, men\n* II \u2013 women, [[water]], [[fire]], [[violence]], and exceptional [[animal]]s<ref>{{Cite book |authorlink=George Lakoff |last=Lakoff |first=George |year=1990 |title=[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]] |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |page=5 }}</ref>\n* III \u2013 edible [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s\n* IV \u2013 miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)\n\nThe class usually labelled \"feminine\" (II) inspired the title of [[George Lakoff]]'s book ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]]''. Some [[Linguistics|linguists]] distinguish between such systems of classification and the [[grammatical gender|gendered division]] of items into the categories of \"feminine\", \"masculine\" and (sometimes) \"neuter\" that is found in, for example, many [[Indo-European languages]].\n\nDyirbal shows a [[split ergativity|split-ergative]] system. Sentences with a first or second person pronoun have their [[verb argument]]s marked for [[Case (linguistics)|case]] in a pattern that mimics [[nominative\u2013accusative language]]s. That is, the first or second person pronoun appears in the least marked case when it is the subject (regardless of the [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] of the verb), and in the most marked case when it is the direct object. Thus Dyirbal is [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] accusative in the first and second persons, but morphologically ergative elsewhere; and it is still always [[syntax|syntactically]] ergative.\n\n==Taboo==\nThere used to be in place a highly complex ''[[taboo]]'' system in Dyirbal culture. A speaker was completely forbidden from speaking with his/her mother-in-law, child-in-law, father's sister's child or mother's brother's child, and from approaching or looking directly at these people.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1972). The Dyirbal language of north Queensland. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> A person is forbidden from speaking with their [[cross-cousin]] of the opposite sex due to the fact that those relatives are of the section from which an individual must marry, but are too close of kin to choose as a spouse so the avoidance might be present on the grounds of indicating who is sexually unavailable.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nFurthermore, because marriage typically takes place a generation above or below, the cross-cousin of the opposite sex often is a potential mother-in-law or father-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1989\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1989). The Dyirbal kinship system. Oceania , 59(4), 245\u2013268.</ref> In addition, when within hearing range of taboo relatives a person was required to use a specialized and complex form of the language with essentially the same [[phonemes]] and [[grammar]], but with a [[lexicon]] that shared no words with the non-taboo language except for four lexical items referring to grandparents on the mother and father's side.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M. W. 1990\">Dixon, R. M. W. (1990). The origin of \"mother-in-law vocabulary\" in two Australian languages. Anthropological Linguistics , 32(1/2), 1\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe taboo relationship is reciprocal. Thus, an individual is not allowed to speak with one's own mother-in-law and it is equally taboo for the mother-in-law to speak with her son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> This relationship is also prevalent among both genders such that a daughter-in-law is forbidden to speak to directly or approach her father-in-law and vice versa.  This taboo exists, although it is not as strongly enforced, between members of the same sex such that a male individual should use the respectful style of speech in the presence of his father-in-law, but the father-in-law can decide whether or not to use the everyday style of speech or the respectful style in the presence of his son-in-law.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/>\n\nThe specialized and complex form of the language is known as the Dyal\u014buy and is used in the presence of the taboo relatives whereas a form referred to in most dialects as Guwal is used in all other circumstances.<ref name=\"Dixon1972\"/> The Dyal\u014buy has one fourth of the amount of lexical items as the everyday language which reduces the semantic content in actual communication in the presence of a taboo relative.<ref>Silverstein, M. (1976). Shifters, linguistic categories, and cultural description. In K. H. Basso & H. A. Selby (Eds.), Meaning in Anthropology (pp. 11\u201355). Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press.</ref> For example, in Dyal\u014buy the verb 'to ask' is [ba\u014barrmba-l]. In Guwal, 'to ask' is [\u014banba-l], 'to invite someone over' is [yumba-l], 'to invite someone to accompany one' is [bunma-l] and 'to keep asking after having already been told' is [gunji-y]. There are no correspondences to the other 3 verbs of Guwal in Dyal\u014buy.<ref name=\"Dixon, R. M.
