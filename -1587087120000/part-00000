It is the second to be led by [[Chris Chibnall]] as head writer and executive producer, alongside executive producer Matt Strevens, the twelfth to air after the programme's revival in 2005, and the thirty-eighth season overall. The twelfth series was broadcast on Sundays, except for the premiere episode, continuing on from the [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]], after regular episodes of the revived era have previously been broadcast on Saturdays. The series was preceded by a New Year's Day special episode in 2019, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\", instead of the traditional annual Christmas special.\n\n[[Jodie Whittaker]] returns for her second series as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], an incarnation of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], an alien [[Time Lord]] who travels through time and space in the [[TARDIS]], which appears from the outside to be a British [[police box]]. It also stars [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]] and [[Mandip Gill]] as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s, [[Graham O'Brien]], [[Ryan Sinclair]] and [[Yasmin Khan (Doctor Who)|Yasmin Khan]], respectively. The series follows the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions as they meet a new incarnation of the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] and his destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the return of [[Jack Harkness]], the appearance of an unknown incarnation of the Doctor from before the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the [[Cybermen]], and the secret of the \"Timeless Child\".\n\nThe ten episodes were directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]], Lee Haven Jones, Nida Manzoor and Emma Sullivan. Alongside Chibnall, who wrote four of the scripts and co-wrote a further three, the writers include Ed Hime, [[Pete McTighe]] and [[Vinay Patel]], who return from writing the previous series, as well as new contributors Nina Metivier, Maxine Alderton and [[Charlene James]]. Filming commenced in January 2019 and concluded by November of that year.

At Graham and Ryan's home, the latter's father Aaron returns. Ryan agrees to talk to him, while the Doctor discovers that the creature she faces is a [[Dalek]]. Controlling Lin, the Dalek steals a ray gun belonging to its race from an archive base and constructs a makeshift Dalek casing out of scrap metal. The Doctor and her friends find Lin, freed from the Dalek's control, and the Doctor confronts the rebuilt creature. The Dalek flies off and attempts to summon a battle fleet, but the Doctor follows and defeats it with the help of Aaron's microwave oven. The exposed mutant creature possesses Aaron in an attempt to force the Doctor to take it to [[Skaro]], but she releases it into a supernova instead.

While sneaking into Barton's headquarters with Ryan, Yaz is captured by an alien, and the Doctor's captured alien is able to free itself by replacing itself with Yaz.

There, one of the guests, Bella, reveals she purposely disrupted the security field as revenge against her mother Kane, who built Tranquility Spa and ignored her childhood. The Doctor discovers the orphan planet is really Earth after years of climate change and war, and the Dregs are mutated human survivors.

Unable to teleport the Doctor, Harkness gives the companions a message from the future, and is forced to teleport away, returning them to Gloucester.  Ruth finds an alarm box outside, breaks it and is engulfed in energy; the Doctor discovers a buried TARDIS, which Ruth claims is hers, introducing herself as the Doctor. In Ruth's TARDIS, the Doctor and Ruth discover that neither of them remembers the other. Ruth once worked for Gat, and hid her identity with a chameleon arch. The TARDIS is brought aboard the Judoon ship. Gat, under orders to bring Ruth back to Gallifrey, is shown a vision of destroyed Gallifrey by the Doctor; Gat shoots at Ruth but the gun backfires.

Suki reveals she is from an alien race devastated by the bacterium they called Praxeus, and had come to Earth to evaluate it further for a cure. While the Doctor finds a cure for humans, using a willing Adam to test it, it cannot stop Praxeus from affecting Suki and soon disintegrates her.

After many years, Tecteun eventually discovers how the Child can regenerate thus leading to the creation of the Time Lords. Meanwhile, the Master contacts Ashad to lead the Cybermen to Gallifrey but realises that he cannot have the Cyberium if Ashad is alive prompting him to shrink Ashad and absorb the Cyberium. He then uses the Cyberium to convert the dead Time Lords into Cybermen. Yaz and Graham safely reunite with Ryan and the others then follow the Cybermen to Gallifrey. Ruth helps the Doctor escape the Matrix by transmitting her old and new memories.

It is the second to be led by [[Chris Chibnall]] as head writer and executive producer, alongside executive producer Matt Strevens, the twelfth to air after the programme's revival in 2005, and the thirty-eighth season overall. The twelfth series was broadcast on Sundays, except for the premiere episode, continuing on from the [[Doctor Who (series 11)|eleventh series]], after regular episodes of the revived era have previously been broadcast on Saturdays. The series was preceded by a New Year's Day special episode in 2019, \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\", instead of the traditional annual Christmas special.\n\n[[Jodie Whittaker]] returns for her second series as the [[Thirteenth Doctor]], an incarnation of [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], an alien [[Time Lord]] who travels through time and space in the [[TARDIS]], which appears from the outside to be a British [[police box]]. It also stars [[Bradley Walsh]], [[Tosin Cole]] and [[Mandip Gill]] as the Doctor's travelling [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]]s, [[Graham O'Brien]], [[Ryan Sinclair]] and [[Yasmin Khan (Doctor Who)|Yasmin Khan]], respectively. The series follows the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions as they meet a new incarnation of the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] and his destruction of [[Gallifrey]], the return of [[Jack Harkness]], the appearance of an unknown incarnation of the Doctor from before the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the [[Cybermen]], and the secret of the \"Timeless Child\".\n\nThe ten episodes were directed by [[Jamie Magnus Stone]], Lee Haven Jones, Nida Manzoor and Emma Sullivan. Alongside Chibnall, who wrote four of the scripts and co-wrote a further three, the writers include Ed Hime, [[Pete McTighe]] and [[Vinay Patel]], who return from writing the previous series, as well as new contributors Nina Metivier, Maxine Alderton and [[Charlene James]]. Filming commenced in January 2019 and concluded by November of that year. The series will be followed by a festive special episode. {{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who episodes (2005\u2013present)}}\nThe twelfth series included two-part stories for the first time since the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]], and more than one two-part story for the first time since the [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]].<ref name=\"TwoParters\" /> \"[[Spyfall (Doctor Who)|Spyfall]]\" is the first two-part episode not to use separate titles for its episodes since \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" (2009\u201310).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blogtorwho.com/doctor-who-will-return-in-spyfall/ |title=Doctor Who will return in\u2026 \"Spyfall\" |work=Blogtor Who |first=Peter |last=Nolan |date=2 December 2019 |accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background = #454CB8 |overall = 6 |series = 6 |title = 20 |director = 14 |writer = 23 |airdate = 16 |viewers = 9 |aux4 = 6 |country = UK\n| overallT   = {{Abbr|No.|Number}}<br />story\n| aux4T      = [[Appreciation Index|{{abbr|AI|Appreciation Index|style=color:white}}]]\n| aux4R      = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n| viewersR   = <ref name=\"AllRatings\" />\n| episodes   =\n{{Episode table/part|p=Special (2019)|c=#454CB8|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Doctor Who (series 12)\n| EpisodeNumber      = 287\n| EpisodeNumber2     = \u2013\n| Title              = [[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\n| DirectedBy         = Wayne Yip\n| WrittenBy          = Chris Chibnall\n| OriginalAirDate    = {{Start date|2019|1|1|df=y}}\n| Viewers            = 7.13\n| Aux4               = 80\n| ShortSummary       = On New Year's Day 2019 in Sheffield, archaeologists Lin and Mitch unintentionally revive a deadly intelligence that has been separated and dormant on Earth since the 9th century. The Doctor is alerted to its presence and lands the TARDIS at Lin and Mitch's dig. The Doctor takes a sample of the creature's slime, while the squid-like creature attaches itself to Lin's back. At Graham and Ryan's home, the latter's father Aaron returns. Ryan agrees to talk to him, while the Doctor discovers that the creature she faces is a [[Dalek]]. Controlling Lin, the Dalek steals a ray gun belonging to its race from an archive base and constructs a makeshift Dalek casing out of scrap metal. The Doctor and her friends find Lin, freed from the Dalek's control, and the Doctor confronts the rebuilt creature. The Dalek flies off and attempts to summon a battle fleet, but the Doctor follows and defeats it with the help of Aaron's microwave oven. The exposed mutant creature possesses Aaron in an attempt to force the Doctor to take it to [[Skaro]], but she releases it into a supernova instead.

C is killed by aliens, but the Doctor and her companions escape. Yaz and Ryan investigate Barton, who invites them to his birthday party. Graham and the Doctor find O in the [[Outback|Australian outback]]. Both groups encounter the same alien lifeforms, though the Doctor is able to capture one of them. While sneaking into Barton's headquarters with Ryan, Yaz is captured by an alien, and the Doctor's captured alien is able to free itself by replacing itself with Yaz. Joined by O, the four investigate Barton at his party. After the Doctor reveals him, Barton tries to escape, so the Doctor and her companions pursue on motorbikes to Barton's private jet. Leaping aboard the jet, O reveals he is actually [[the Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] &ndash; having been in control of Barton and the aliens the whole time.

In the present, Ryan discovers how to safely land the plane after finding a recording of the Doctor, but Barton brands the companions as fugitives. The Doctor and Ada accidentally land in Paris during [[World War II]], but are rescued by [[Noor Inayat Khan]].

Several guests and facility workers are killed before the Doctor re-establishes the security fields. The survivors leave the dome to save a fellow survivor, but the Dregs lead them into a trap, and they retreat to a tunnel to return to the facility. There, one of the guests, Bella, reveals she purposely disrupted the security field as revenge against her mother Kane, who built Tranquility Spa and ignored her childhood. The Doctor discovers the orphan planet is really Earth after years of climate change and war, and the Dregs are mutated human survivors.

The Doctor, Graham and Ryan visit Edison's workshop. The cloaked figure arrives at Edison's lab and pursues Edison. The Doctor tries to warn Tesla and Yaz back at his lab, but they are captured and transported to an invisible alien ship, belonging to the Queen of the Skithra, who demands help to fix it. The Doctor transports herself, Tesla and Yaz back to Tesla's lab. The Queen refuses to leave, threatening to destroy Earth if Tesla is not surrendered.

A text from Lee triggers Ruth's memories, which leads them to a lighthouse. Unable to teleport the Doctor, Harkness gives the companions a message from the future, and is forced to teleport away, returning them to Gloucester.  Ruth finds an alarm box outside, breaks it and is engulfed in energy; the Doctor discovers a buried TARDIS, which Ruth claims is hers, introducing herself as the Doctor. In Ruth's TARDIS, the Doctor and Ruth discover that neither of them remembers the other. Ruth once worked for Gat, and hid her identity with a chameleon arch. The TARDIS is brought aboard the Judoon ship. Gat, under orders to bring Ruth back to Gallifrey, is shown a vision of destroyed Gallifrey by the Doctor; Gat shoots at Ruth but the gun backfires.

The Doctor determines the bacterium is drawn to [[microplastics]]. Suki reveals she is from an alien race devastated by the bacterium they called Praxeus, and had come to Earth to evaluate it further for a cure. While the Doctor finds a cure for humans, using a willing Adam to test it, it cannot stop Praxeus from affecting Suki and soon disintegrates her. Travelling to Yaz' location, they find they are under the [[Indian Ocean garbage patch]], where Suki's ship is located. They load the ship's reserves with the antidote and set the ship to self-destruct in the atmosphere to disperse it, but Jake willingly pilots the vessel when the auto-pilot fails.

A spectral figure appears and reveals itself as a [[Cyberman]] named Ashad that is seeking the missing Cyberium, the collected knowledge of the Cybermen.

Aboard the humans' ship, they pass through a battlefield with debris of dead Cyberman and board a seemingly-abandoned Cyber carrier.

After many years, Tecteun eventually discovers how the Child can regenerate thus leading to the creation of the Time Lords. Meanwhile, the Master contacts Ashad to lead the Cybermen to Gallifrey but realises that he cannot have the Cyberium if Ashad is alive prompting him to shrink Ashad and absorb the Cyberium. He then uses the Cyberium to convert the dead Time Lords into Cybermen. Yaz and Graham safely reunite with Ryan and the others then follow the Cybermen to Gallifrey. Ruth helps the Doctor escape the Matrix by transmitting her old and new memories. Back in the chamber, the Doctor plans to detonate the death particles from Ashad's remains to stop the Master, but Ko Sharmus arrives and takes her place, detonating the particles, presumably killing the Master and the cyberconverted Time Lords.

It was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 16 June 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Doctor Who UK airdate announced |work=News |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]] |date=27 February 2007 |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312164215/http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> It is the first of three episodes that form a linked narrative, followed by \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\". The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n===Cast Notes===\n\n* Since 2017, Jacobi has since reprised the role due to popular demand for several ''Doctor Who audio dramas'' for [[Big Finish Productions]] beginning with [[The War Master (audio drama series)|\"The War Master\"]].\n\n* [[John Simm]] reprised his role as the Master in the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s final story [[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|\"The End of Time\"]] and reprised the role again in [[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|\"World Enough and Time\"]] and [[The Doctor Falls|\"The Doctor Falls\"]], the finale of [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]], the final series to feature [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Michelle Gomez]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Missy]]. Simm will reprise the role once again in the upcoming audio drama ''Masterful'' by [[Big Finish Productions]].\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

It was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 16 June 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Doctor Who UK airdate announced |work=News |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]] |date=27 February 2007 |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312164215/http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> It is the first of three episodes that form a linked narrative, followed by \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\". The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n===Cast Notes===\n\n* Since 2017, Jacobi has since reprised the role due to popular demand for several ''Doctor Who audio dramas'' for [[Big Finish Productions]] beginning with [[The War Master (audio drama series)|\"The War Master\"]].\n\n* [[John Simm]] reprised his role as the Master in the [[Tenth Doctor]]'s final story [[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|\"The End of Time\"]] and reprised the role again in [[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|\"World Enough and Time\"]] and [[The Doctor Falls|\"The Doctor Falls\"]], the finale of [[Doctor Who (series 10)|Series 10]], the final series to feature [[Peter Capaldi]] as the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Michelle Gomez]] as [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Missy]]\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.
