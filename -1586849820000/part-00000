The writer uses [[Markup language|markup]] tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add [[citation]]s and [[cross-reference]]s. A [[TeX]] distribution such as [[TeX Live]] or [[MikTeX]] is used to produce an output file (such as [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[Device independent file format|DVI]]) suitable for printing or [[digital distribution]].

In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating [[DocBook]] and other [[XML]]-based formats to [[PDF]]. The typesetting system offers programmable [[desktop publishing]] features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and [[bibliography|bibliographies]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nLike TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/dromney/arabic-latex|title=Arabic in LaTeX|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.\n\nLaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by [[Leslie Lamport]] at [[SRI International]].<ref>{{cite web | url=//research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#latex | title=The Writings of Leslie Lamport: LaTeX: A Document Preparation System | author=Leslie Lamport | date=April 23, 2007 | work=Leslie Lamport's Home Page | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as <span class=\"texhtml\" style=\"font-family: 'CMU Serif', cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, 'Latin Modern Math', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\">L<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: 0.25em; margin-left: -0.36em; margin-right: -0.15em; line-height: 1ex;\">a</span>T<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em; line-height: 1ex;\">e</span>X<span style=\"margin-left: 0.15em;\">2</span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: -0.35ex; line-height: 1ex;\">\u03b5</span></span>).

In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as ''chapter'', ''section'', ''table'', ''figure'', etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content \u2014 while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many [[word processor]]s allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of [[Cascading Style Sheets]] in styling [[HTML|HTML documents]].\n\nThe LaTeX system is a [[markup language]] that handles typesetting and rendering<ref>The design of LaTeX owes something to earlier markup systems such as [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]].</ref>, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying [[macro language]] to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into ''packages,'' which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics<ref name=\":0\" /> (e.g., the use of the <code>align</code> environment provided by the <code>amsmath</code> package to produce aligned equations).\n\nIn order to create a document in LaTeX, you first write a file, say <code>document.tex</code>, using your preferred [[text editor]]. Then you give your <code>document.tex</code> file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing.<ref>PDF output is common, but TeX can output other formats such as DVI (\"Device independent\" format).  See below for more detail about outputs.</ref> This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the [[WYSIWYG|What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get]] (WYSIWYG) style of document editing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle known to the computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing a single key, while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window. Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview,<ref>{{cite web |url = //www.overleaf.com | title = Overleaf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //www.seeveeze.com/ | title = Seeveeze}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //latexbase.com | title = LaTeX Base}}</ref> while other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a streamlined single window.<ref>{{cite web | url = //www.authorea.com/ | title = Authorea}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe example below shows the LaTeX input and corresponding output:\n<!-- Don't change the source code unless you know what you are doing and have checked that the output is the same or has been updated. -->\n\n<div class=\"noresize\" style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The LPPL is [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] compliant as of version 1.3. As [[free software]], LaTeX is available on most operating systems, which include [[UNIX]] ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX]]), [[BSD]] ([[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]), [[Linux]] ([[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|Red Hat]], [[Debian]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]), [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[DOS]], [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS]] and [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan9]].\n\n==Related software==\n\nAs a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, [[GNU Texinfo]], [[AMSTeX]], and [[ConTeXt]].\n\nWhen TeX \"compiles\" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros \u2192 TeX \u2192 Driver \u2192 Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a [[DVI (file format)|DVI]] file, which is usually converted to a [[PostScript]] file. More recently, [[H\u00e0n Th\u1ebf Th\u00e0nh]] and others have written a new implementation of TeX called [[pdfTeX]], which also outputs to [[PDF]] and takes advantage of features available in that format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/|title=pdfTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref> The [[XeTeX]] engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/xetex/|title=XeTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe default font for LaTeX is Knuth's [[Computer Modern]], which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.\n\nThere are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based.

They consist of plain text and do not contain hidden formatting codes or binary instructions. Additionally, TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to [[Rich Text Format]] (<code>*.rtf</code>) or [[XML]]. This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or [[TeX4ht]]. LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the <code>inputenc</code> package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.\n* HeVeA is a converter written in [[Ocaml]] that converts LaTeX documents to [[HTML5]].

The typesetting system offers programmable [[desktop publishing]] features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and [[bibliography|bibliographies]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nLike TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/dromney/arabic-latex|title=Arabic in LaTeX|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.\n\nLaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by [[Leslie Lamport]] at [[SRI International]].<ref>{{cite web | url=//research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#latex | title=The Writings of Leslie Lamport: LaTeX: A Document Preparation System | author=Leslie Lamport | date=April 23, 2007 | work=Leslie Lamport's Home Page | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as <span class=\"texhtml\" style=\"font-family: 'CMU Serif', cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, 'Latin Modern Math', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\">L<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: 0.25em; margin-left: -0.36em; margin-right: -0.15em; line-height: 1ex;\">a</span>T<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em; line-height: 1ex;\">e</span>X<span style=\"margin-left: 0.15em;\">2</span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: -0.35ex; line-height: 1ex;\">\u03b5</span></span>).

In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as ''chapter'', ''section'', ''table'', ''figure'', etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content \u2014 while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many [[word processor]]s allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of [[Cascading Style Sheets]] in styling [[HTML|HTML documents]].\n\nThe LaTeX system is a [[markup language]] that handles typesetting and rendering<ref>The design of LaTeX owes something to earlier markup systems such as [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]].</ref>, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying [[macro language]] to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into ''packages,'' which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics<ref name=\":0\" /> (e.g., the use of the <code>align</code> environment provided by the <code>amsmath</code> package to produce aligned equations).\n\nIn order to create a document in LaTeX, you first write a file, say <code>document.tex</code>, using your preferred [[text editor]]. Then you give your <code>document.tex</code> file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing.<ref>PDF output is common, but TeX can output other formats such as DVI (\"Device independent\" format).  See below for more detail about outputs.</ref> This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the [[WYSIWYG|What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get]] (WYSIWYG) style of document editing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle known to the computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing a single key, while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window. Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview,<ref>{{cite web |url = //www.overleaf.com | title = Overleaf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //www.seeveeze.com/ | title = Seeveeze}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //latexbase.com | title = LaTeX Base}}</ref> while other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a streamlined single window.<ref>{{cite web | url = //www.authorea.com/ | title = Authorea}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe example below shows the LaTeX input and corresponding output:\n<!-- Don't change the source code unless you know what you are doing and have checked that the output is the same or has been updated. -->\n\n<div class=\"noresize\" style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The LPPL is [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] compliant as of version 1.3. As [[free software]], LaTeX is available on most operating systems, which include [[UNIX]] ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX]]), [[BSD]] ([[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]), [[Linux]] ([[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|Red Hat]], [[Debian]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]), [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[DOS]], [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS]] and [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan9]].\n\n==Related software==\n\nAs a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, [[GNU Texinfo]], [[AMSTeX]], and [[ConTeXt]].\n\nWhen TeX \"compiles\" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros \u2192 TeX \u2192 Driver \u2192 Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a [[DVI (file format)|DVI]] file, which is usually converted to a [[PostScript]] file. More recently, [[H\u00e0n Th\u1ebf Th\u00e0nh]] and others have written a new implementation of TeX called [[pdfTeX]], which also outputs to [[PDF]] and takes advantage of features available in that format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/|title=pdfTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref> The [[XeTeX]] engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/xetex/|title=XeTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe default font for LaTeX is Knuth's [[Computer Modern]], which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.\n\nThere are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based.

They consist of plain text and do not contain hidden formatting codes or binary instructions. Additionally, TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to [[Rich Text Format]] (<code>*.rtf</code>) or [[XML]]. This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or [[TeX4ht]]. LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the <code>inputenc</code> package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.\n* HeVeA is a converter written in [[Ocaml]] that converts LaTeX documents to [[HTML5]].

He needed to write TeX macros for his own use, and thought that with a little extra effort he could make a general package usable by others.  Peter Gordon, an editor at [[Addison-Wesley]], convinced him to write a LaTeX user's manual for publication (Lamport was initially skeptical that anyone would pay money for it);<ref name=Lamport2018>{{cite web |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.pdf |title=My Writings |pages=48\u201349 |first=Leslie |last=Lamport |date=23 August 2018 |accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref> it came out in 1986<ref name=Lamport1986 /> and sold hundreds of thousands of copies.<ref name=Lamport2018 />  Meanwhile, Lamport released versions of his LaTeX macros in 1984 and 1985.  On 21 August 1989, at a TeX Users Group (TUG) meeting at Stanford, Lamport agreed to turn over maintenance and development of LaTeX to Frank Mittelbach.   Mittelbach, along with Chris Rowley and Rainer Sch\u00f6pf, formed the LaTeX3 team; in 1994, they released LaTeX 2e, the current standard version, and continue working on LaTeX3.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203013048/http://web.syr.edu/~trscavo/latex/latex-history.html |archive-date=3 December 1998 |url=http://web.syr.edu/~trscavo/latex/latex-history.html |url-status=dead |title=TeX, LaTeX, and AMS-LaTeX |first=Tom |last=Scavo |access-date=6 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[BibTeX]] \u2013 [[reference management software]] typically used with LaTeX\n* [[Formula editor]]\n* [[List of document markup languages]]\n* [[List of TeX extensions]]\n* [[xdvi]] \u2013 software for viewing DVI files while using [[Unix]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last=Flynn | first=Peter | title=Formatting Information: A Beginner's Guide to LaTeX | publisher=Silmaril | location=Cork | year=2017 | edition=7th online | url=http://latex.silmaril.ie/formattinginformation/ | origyear=2002 | page=193}}\n* {{cite book | last=Griffiths | first=David F. |author2=Highman, David S.  | title=Learning LaTeX | publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics | location=Philadelphia | year=1997 | isbn=0-89871-383-8}}\n* {{cite book | last=Kopka | first=Helmut |author2=Daly, Patrick W.  | title=Guide to LaTeX | edition=4th | publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional | year=2003 | isbn=0-321-17385-6}}\n* {{cite book | last=Lamport | first=Leslie | authorlink=Leslie Lamport | others=illustrations by Duane Bibby | title=LaTeX: A document preparation system: User's guide and reference | edition=2nd | publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional | location=Reading, Mass |year=1994 | isbn=0-201-52983-1 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Mittelbach | first=Frank |author2=Goossens, Michel  | title=The LaTeX Companion |edition=2nd | publisher=Addison-Wesley | year=2004 | isbn=0-201-36299-6}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=no|commons=LaTeX|b=LaTeX|n=no|q=no|s=no|v=LaTeX|voy=no|species=no|d=Q5310}}\n* {{official website}}\n\n{{TeX navbox}}\n{{LaTeX navbox}}\n{{ebooks}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Latex}}\n[[Category:1983 software]]\n[[Category:Declarative markup languages]]\n[[Category:Free TeX software]]\n[[Category:Free text editors]]\n[[Category:Free typesetting software]]\n[[Category:Typesetting|Software]]\n[[Category:Typography software|Typesetting]]\n[[Category:Open formats]]\n[[Category:Software using the LPPL license]]\n[[Category:SRI International software]]\n[[Category:Formula editors]]\n", "name_user": "Lrohrstrom", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed chemistry from the \"widely used\" phrase as it is neither mentioned in the references or a common accepted fact.

The first bNAb turned out to be clinically irrelevant, but in 1994 another team isolated a bNAb that worked on cells taken from patients. This antibody attached to a \"conserved\" portion of gp120 that outlasts many of its mutations, affecting 17/24 tested strains at low doses.

The final sector of the lap also saw changes, with the zig-zagging section of the track being reversed compared to the previous year. The removal of the chicane came as Formula E looked to reduce the number of chicanes on the tracks in the championship, in the wake of several accidents happening at such locations in several races, with the highest profile incident seeing a pile-up at the first corner during the [[2019 Swiss ePrix]] blocking the track, and causing a lengthy red flag period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-racing365.com/formula-e/valencia-chicane-mods-for-pre-season-test/|title=Valencia Chicane Mods for Pre-Season Test \u2013 e-racing365|last=Smith|first=Sam|website=e-racing365.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Qualifying ===\n[[Mitch Evans]] scored both his, and [[Jaguar Racing]]'s 2nd ever pole in the [[Formula E|ABB Formula E Championship]], after topping the timesheets in both the qualifying groups, and the Superpole shootout. During the superpole shootout, he denied [[Maximilian G\u00fcnther]] pole by a margin of nearly 3 tenths, after clocking in an impressive time at the final sector of the track, being 0.22s faster than the rest of the competition, despite being the last to leave the pits for the track. Prior to the Kiwi's sensational run in the final sector of the track, it had appeared that the German would be set to clinch his first ever Formula E pole, having clocked the fastest time in the first 2 sectors of the track, to beat his fellow countryman, [[Pascal Wehrlein]] to provisional pole by nearly 6 tenths. The Mahindra driver had left the pits first for his Superpole lap, and ended up posting a lap slower than his effort in the Group stage. [[Felipe Massa]] came in fourth, edging out [[Oliver Turvey]], who had posted a phenomenal time in the final sector during the Group 4 session, in his [[NIO 333 FE Team|NIO 333]] machine. [[2015\u201316 Formula E season|Season 2]] champion [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] came in 6th, and last in the Superpole session, after posting 2 slow sectors in his [[Nissan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/santiago-eprix-evans-pole-jaguar/4658799/|title=Santiago E-Prix: Evans takes pole in Chile for Jaguar|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\nBehind the superpole runners, qualifying 7th was the [[Venturi Racing|Venturi]] run [[Mercedes EQ Formula E Team|Mercedes]] of [[Edoardo Mortara]], who had his lap affected, due to an incident with fellow Group 2 runner [[Robin Frijns]], after Frijns experienced a spin on his flying lap. A massive rear end snap under braking spun Frijns around on the approach to Turn 1, where he barely missed the tyre wall. As he attempted to rejoin the track, the Dutchman delayed Mortara by around 0.4 seconds.

[[Alexander Sims (racing driver)|Alexander Sims]] saw his pole streak come to an end, the championship leader coming in 15th, ahead of the [[Envision Virgin Racing]] run Audi of [[Sam Bird]], and the [[Dragon Racing|Dragon-Penske]] of [[Brendon Hartley]]. [[James Calado]] came in 18th, while the sister [[Dragon Racing|Dragon]] car of [[Nico M\u00fcller]] came in 19th.

Polesitter [[Mitch Evans]] came in 3rd for Panasonic [[Jaguar Racing]], benefitting from a penalty issued to [[Nyck de Vries]], who had come in third on the road.

Following this, G\u00fcnther gradually fell down the order, while Evans consolidated his lead out front.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the race quietened down, until past the 40th minute, when G\u00fcnther\u2019s teammate, the championship leader Alexander Sims, ground to a halt on track, prompting a full-course yellow, while the stewards removed his car, with the FCY being lifted at the 37 minute mark on the clock. In less than a lap after the restart, Oliver Rowland made contact with Sam Bird, damaging his front wing and putting Bird into a spin. Rowland would enter the pits to replace the wing shortly after the incident.\n\nUsing his Attack Mode power boost, G\u00fcnther advanced on Edoardo Mortara, using the extra power to sweep past the Venturi driver and to move back into third. With Mortara in fourth and his teammate Felipe Massa in fifth, the two Venturi cars trailed the podium sitters, seemingly ready to pick up a podium, should any of the top 3 suffer from issues. However, this was not to be, as the duo activated Attack Mode against each other in a bid to attack overtake and defend from the other.  Heading into Turn 10, Mortara made a lunge on Massa, putting the Brazilian into the wall, dropping him into Seventh. Reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne took advantage of this, to slip into 5th.\n\nMeanwhile, up front, G\u00fcnther activated Attack Mode to pass Wehrlein for second and with still a minute on his attack mode, G\u00fcnther went for the lead, slipping past Evans on the approach to Turn 9, the extra power on hand for the German giving the Kiwi no chance to defend his position.\n\nWith 14 minutes to go, Vergne and his teammate [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] became the next drivers to pass the Mahindra of [[Pascal Wehrlein]], the pair bumping Wehrlein down to fifth. Having made eight-places since the start of the race, damage to Vergne's front wing finally appeared to be affecting the Frenchman's car, his front-left tire starting to rub on the wing, leaving a trail of smoke behind him.  Just 2 laps later,  with just seven minutes to go, the wing broke, forcing the reigning champion into the pits.\n\nFollowing this, Da Costa passed Evans on the long Turn 8, and set about hunting down G\u00fcnther for the win. With both cars coming into Turn 10 together, Da Costa forced the BMW driver wide, locking up his fronts at the turn-10 hairpin and bumping along the side of the BMW, pulling into first place. However, in spite of this, Da Costa soon found his lead under threat from G\u00fcnther, due to him having to nurse battery temperatures,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpfans.com/en/articles/49277/gunther-takes-maiden-formula-e-victory-in-santiago-classic/|title=Gunther takes maiden Formula E victory in Santiago classic|last=GPfans.com|website=GPfans|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> and on the last lap, G\u00fcnther (BMW iFE.20) stormed past Da Costa at Turn 9 (DS E-TENSE FE20), pulling away from the Portuguese, and winning by a margin of 2.067s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://racer.com/2020/01/18/guenther-outduels-da-costa-for-santiago-win/|title=Guenther outduels da Costa for Santiago win|date=2020-01-18|website=RACER|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n\n=== Qualifying ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Group draw<ref name=\"Groups\">{{cite web|title=Doc 19 - Qualifying Groups|url=https://fe-noticeboard.s3.amazonaws.com/05_2019-20/03_R03%20Santiago/ABB%20FIA%20Formula%20E%20Championship/19_Doc%2019%20-%20Qualifying%20Groups.pdf|publisher=FIA Formula E|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The final sector of the lap also saw changes, with the zig-zagging section of the track being reversed compared to the previous year. The removal of the chicane came as Formula E looked to reduce the number of chicanes on the tracks in the championship, in the wake of several accidents happening at such locations in several races, with the highest profile incident seeing a pile-up at the first corner during the [[2019 Swiss ePrix]] blocking the track, and causing a lengthy red flag period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-racing365.com/formula-e/valencia-chicane-mods-for-pre-season-test/|title=Valencia Chicane Mods for Pre-Season Test \u2013 e-racing365|last=Smith|first=Sam|website=e-racing365.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Qualifying ===\n[[Mitch Evans]] scored both his, and [[Jaguar Racing]]'s 2nd ever pole in the [[Formula E|ABB Formula E Championship]], after topping the timesheets in both the qualifying groups, and the Superpole shootout. During the superpole shootout, he denied [[Maximilian G\u00fcnther]] pole by a margin of nearly 3 tenths, after clocking in an impressive time at the final sector of the track, being 0.22s faster than the rest of the competition, despite being the last to leave the pits for the track. Prior to the Kiwi's sensational run in the final sector of the track, it had appeared that the German would be set to clinch his first ever Formula E pole, having clocked the fastest time in the first 2 sectors of the track, to beat his fellow countryman, [[Pascal Wehrlein]] to provisional pole by nearly 6 tenths. The Mahindra driver had left the pits first for his Superpole lap, and ended up posting a lap slower than his effort in the Group stage. [[Felipe Massa]] came in fourth, edging out [[Oliver Turvey]], who had posted a phenomenal time in the final sector during the Group 4 session, in his [[NIO 333 FE Team|NIO 333]] machine. [[2015\u201316 Formula E season|Season 2]] champion [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] came in 6th, and last in the Superpole session, after posting 2 slow sectors in his [[Nissan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/formula-e/news/santiago-eprix-evans-pole-jaguar/4658799/|title=Santiago E-Prix: Evans takes pole in Chile for Jaguar|website=www.motorsport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\nBehind the superpole runners, qualifying 7th was the [[Venturi Racing|Venturi]] run [[Mercedes EQ Formula E Team|Mercedes]] of [[Edoardo Mortara]], who had his lap affected, due to an incident with fellow Group 2 runner [[Robin Frijns]], after Frijns experienced a spin on his flying lap. A massive rear end snap under braking spun Frijns around on the approach to Turn 1, where he barely missed the tyre wall. As he attempted to rejoin the track, the Dutchman delayed Mortara by around 0.4 seconds. In spite of this, Mortara was still able to set the fastest time in Group 2, courtesy of a strong final sector, and held provisional pole at the time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e-racing365.com/formula-e/evans-beats-guenther-to-santiago-pole/|title=Evans Beats Guenther to Santiago Pole \u2013 e-racing365|last=Kilshaw|first=Jake|website=e-racing365.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> Behind Mortara were the 2 factory-run [[Mercedes EQ Formula E Team|Mercedes]] of [[Nyck de Vries]], and his teammate [[Stoffel Vandoorne]], while [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] rounded out the top 10, in his [[Techeetah|DS Techeetah]]. Reigning series champion [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]]'s tricky start to the season continued, the Frenchman coming in P11, over a second slower than his teammate, ahead of the leading [[Porsche]] of [[Neel Jani]].

[[Alexander Sims (racing driver)|Alexander Sims]] saw his pole streak come to an end, the championship leader coming in 15th, ahead of the [[Envision Virgin Racing]] run Audi of [[Sam Bird]], and the [[Dragon Racing|Dragon-Penske]] of [[Brendon Hartley]]. [[James Calado]] came in 18th, while the sister [[Dragon Racing|Dragon]] car of [[Nico M\u00fcller]] came in 19th. [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me d'Ambrosio]] suffered car trouble towards the end of his flying lap, leaving him languishing down in 20th, after failing to start the second race at [[Ad Diriyah]] due to a technical issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crash.net/fe/news/935500/1/evans-beats-guenther-santiago-formula-e-pole|title=Evans beats Guenther to Santiago Formula E pole|date=2020-01-18|website=Crash|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\nBehind d'Ambrosio, was the [[Virgin Racing (Formula E team)|Virgin]] run Audi of Frijns, his spin dealing him a penalty in terms of his final laptime, while [[Lucas di Grassi]] had his lap affected by a crash by [[Oliver Rowland]], which initially cost him a few tenths, before the [[2016\u201317 Formula E season|Season 3]] champion ruined his own laptime by running wide at Turn 9.

Polesitter [[Mitch Evans]] came in 3rd for Panasonic [[Jaguar Racing]], benefitting from a penalty issued to [[Nyck de Vries]], who had come in third on the road. De Vries lost his maiden podium, due to a infringement of the minimum battery coolant temperature. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autosport.com/fe/news/147946/why-mercedes-de-vries-lost-maiden-fe-podium|title=Why Mercedes' de Vries lost maiden Formula E podium in Santiago|last=Kalinauckas|first=Alex|website=Autosport.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref> This penalty also bumped [[Pascal Wehrlein]] to fourth overall in the pecking order. \n\nAt the start, Evans held the lead off the line, while Mahindra Racing\u2019s Pascal Wehrlein forced his way past G\u00fcnther, who suffered from a poor start, at the tight off-track approach to Turn 2, which the field used throughout the race. Following this, G\u00fcnther gradually fell down the order, while Evans consolidated his lead out front.\n\nFrom this point onwards, the race quietened down, until past the 40th minute, when G\u00fcnther\u2019s teammate, the championship leader Alexander Sims, ground to a halt on track, prompting a full-course yellow, while the stewards removed his car, with the FCY being lifted at the 37 minute mark on the clock. In less than a lap after the restart, Oliver Rowland made contact with Sam Bird, damaging his front wing and putting Bird into a spin. Rowland would enter the pits to replace the wing shortly after the incident.\n\nUsing his Attack Mode power boost, G\u00fcnther advanced on Edoardo Mortara, using the extra power to sweep past the Venturi driver and to move back into third. With Mortara in fourth and his teammate Felipe Massa in fifth, the two Venturi cars trailed the podium sitters, seemingly ready to pick up a podium, should any of the top 3 suffer from issues. However, this was not to be, as the duo activated Attack Mode against each other in a bid to attack overtake and defend from the other.  Heading into Turn 10, Mortara made a lunge on Massa, putting the Brazilian into the wall, dropping him into Seventh. Reigning champion Jean-Eric Vergne took advantage of this, to slip into 5th. \n\nMeanwhile, up front, G\u00fcnther activated Attack Mode to pass Wehrlein for second and with still a minute on his attack mode, G\u00fcnther went for the lead, slipping past Evans on the approach to Turn 9, the extra power on hand for the German giving the Kiwi no chance to defend his position.\n\nWith 14 minutes to go, Vergne and his teammate [[Ant\u00f3nio F\u00e9lix da Costa]] became the next drivers to pass the Mahindra of [[Pascal Wehrlein]], the pair bumping Wehrlein down to fifth. Having made eight-places since the start of the race, damage to Vergne's front wing finally appeared to be affecting the Frenchman's car, his front-left tire starting to rub on the wing, leaving a trail of smoke behind him.  Just 2 laps later,  with just seven minutes to go, the wing broke, forcing the reigning champion into the pits.\n\nFollowing this, Da Costa passed Evans on the long Turn 8, and set about hunting down G\u00fcnther for the win. With both cars coming into Turn 10 together, Da Costa forced the BMW driver wide, locking up his fronts at the turn-10 hairpin and bumping along the side of the BMW, pulling into first place. However, in spite of this, Da Costa soon found his lead under threat from G\u00fcnther, due to him having to nurse battery temperatures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpfans.com/en/articles/49277/gunther-takes-maiden-formula-e-victory-in-santiago-classic/|title=Gunther takes maiden Formula E victory in Santiago classic|last=GPfans.com|website=GPfans|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>, and on the last lap, G\u00fcnther (BMW iFE.20) stormed past Da Costa at Turn 9 (DS E-TENSE FE20), pulling away from the Portuguese, and winning by a margin of 2.067s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://racer.com/2020/01/18/guenther-outduels-da-costa-for-santiago-win/|title=Guenther outduels da Costa for Santiago win|date=2020-01-18|website=RACER|language=en|access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n\n=== Qualifying ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" | Group draw<ref name=\"Groups\">{{cite web|title=Doc 19 - Qualifying Groups|url=https://fe-noticeboard.s3.amazonaws.com/05_2019-20/03_R03%20Santiago/ABB%20FIA%20Formula%20E%20Championship/19_Doc%2019%20-%20Qualifying%20Groups.pdf|publisher=FIA Formula E|accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Usually, after a ''Content Cop'' video is released, the creator or creators under scrutiny lose a significant amount of subscribers and their like-to-dislike ratio lowers.

In the video, he accused Keem of threatening big YouTubers with negative coverage and promoting small channels or accusing them of hiding something. Carter called Keem a \"very rash decision maker\" and showed clips of Keem saying what he called \"really regrettable shit\". In response, Keem called the ''Content Cop'' video \"entertaining\" and denied wanting to attack other YouTubers, saying he has \"no problem booking guests or landing exclusive interviews\". He also apologized for the comments and incidents he caused, but justified saying '[[nigger]]' by using a [[genealogical DNA test]] to prove he is nine percent black.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lorenz|first1=Taylor|title=How DramaAlert Became the TMZ of YouTube|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-drama-alert-became-the-tmz-of-youtube|newspaper=The Daily Beast|accessdate=January 27, 2018|language=en|date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nReferring to Carter's controversial past use of the word 'nigger', storytime YouTuber Tana Mongeau criticized him on Snapchat, and controversially wrote to Carter on [[Twitter]], \"so 3 million ppl subscribe to u and u openly say the n-word and retard????

This resulted in Tana reacting unfavorably and Carter being escorted off the premises by security. Three days later, Mongeau uploaded a video titled \"The N Word\" describing her version of the encounter. Carter subsequently published a ''Content Cop'' episode on Mongeau, accusing her of hypocrisy by showing videos of Mongeau using the word 'nigger' in the past.

With about 25,700 inhabitants, Idstein is the second biggest town in the district (after [[Taunusstein]]).\n\n==History==\nIdstein, which had its first documentary mention in 1102 as ''Etichenstein'', was granted town and market rights in 1287 by King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]]. Besides the ''Hexenturm'' near the old Nassau castle that has already been mentioned, the town has a [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town centre with many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings. The town's oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410.\n\nFrom the documentary mention in 1102 until 1721, Idstein was, with interruptions, residence of the Counts of [[House of Nassau|Nassau-Idstein]] and other Nassau lines. One of the Counts, [[Adolf of Germany]], was, as a compromise candidate, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1292 to 1298, later falling in battle against the anti-king [[Albert I of Germany|Albrecht I of Habsburg]].\n\nThe Nassau Counts' holdings were subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line.\n\n[[File:Idstein De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|400px|Idstein \u2013 Extract from ''Topographia Hassiae'' by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] the Younger, 1655]]\nIn the 17th century, Count [[Johann (Nassau-Idstein)|Johann of Nassau-Idstein]] persecuted witches in Idstein.<ref>[http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-hexenverfolgung.htm Die Hexenverfolgung in Idstein] nassau-info.de</ref>\n\nIn 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Oberamt]]''.\n\nNassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the [[Duchy of Nassau]], becoming a member of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, [[Prussia]] annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nThe residential palace from the 17th century is used by the ''Pestalozzischule'' as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace.\n\nFrom the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the [[Second World War]], many women became [[Arbeitseinsatz|forced labour]] for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the L\u00f6herplatz, which is now a marketplace.\n\nThe private ''Kalmenhof'' clinic in Idstein was drawn into the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] [[Euthanasia]] programme. Under [[Action T4]], the Kalmenhof served as a way station for the \"killing institute\" at [[Hadamar Clinic|Hadamar]]. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of ''[[Karl Brandt|Aktion Brandt]]'', became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nShortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/specials/wissen/index.jsp?rubrik=6558&key=standard_document_3613168 |title=HR Online \u00fcber den Kalmenhof |access-date=2008-11-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060519070211/http://www.hr-online.de/website/specials/wissen/index.jsp?rubrik=6558&key=standard_document_3613168 |archive-date=2006-05-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.vaeter-aktuell.papaserver.de/politik/politik-1949-1994/2004-Heimkinder-Kongress.htm Presseberichte Heimkinder-Kongress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218204612/http://www.vaeter-aktuell.papaserver.de/politik/politik-1949-1994/2004-Heimkinder-Kongress.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n\nEleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform.\n\n==Population development==\n[[File:St Martin Idstein.JPG|thumb|300px|View from the Hexenturm to [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]], 2010]]\n<small>(as of 31 December)</small>\n{|\n!Year!!Population\n|-\n|1998\n|align=\"right\" |22,346\n|-\n|1999\n|align=\"right\" |22,611\n|-\n|2000\n|align=\"right\" |22,611\n|-\n|2001\n|align=\"right\" |22,786\n|-\n|2002\n|align=\"right\" |22,998\n|-\n|2003\n|align=\"right\" |22,893\n|-\n|2004\n|align=\"right\" |22,894\n|-\n|2005\n|align=\"right\" |23,229\n|-\n|2006\n|align=\"right\" |25,696\n|}\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Azure a round castle wall embattled with two portcullises open, the wall enclosing two towers, the whole Or, with peaked roofs gules, between the portcullises an inescutcheon azure with a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules among six billets Or.\n\nThe [[inescutcheon]] is the arms borne by the [[House of Nassau]]. The town's flag also bears this design set against orange and blue, Nassau's colours.\n\n===Town partnerships===\nIdstein maintains partnerships with the following places:\n* {{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Heusden]], [[North Brabant]], [[Netherlands]]\n* {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Lana, South Tyrol|Lana]], [[South Tyrol]], [[Italy]]\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Uglich]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], [[Russia]]\n* {{flagicon|Belgium}} [[Zwijndrecht, Belgium|Zwijndrecht]], [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Transport===\nIdstein has an [[interchange (road)|interchange]] on the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] north of [[Wiesbaden]] between [[Niedernhausen]] and [[Bad Camberg]], and a [[railway station]] with direct connections to [[Limburg an der Lahn]], [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Wiesbaden]].\n\nThe building of a bypass, ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 275, lessened the traffic in the historic Old Town. However, the traffic volume in the town core is still very high.\n\nAt intersections in the town core, [[roundabout]]s have improved the traffic flow, in some places noticeably. The ''S\u00fcdtangente'' (south \"tangent\" road), which had been planned since 1981, was completed in 2009, reducing traffic in town further. It links two new development areas. Of the \u20ac9,000,000 for the project, roughly 60% was borne by the [[States of Germany|state]] of Hesse.\n\n===Local transport===\nWithin Idstein town limits are two railway stations on the [[Main-Lahn Railway]] (''Main-Lahn-Bahn''), Idstein and W\u00f6rsdorf. There are hourly trains serving the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden\u2013Niedernhausen\u2013Limburg run into the evening. In [[Niedernhausen]] there is also a transfer point with S-Bahn line S2 towards [[Dietzenbach]] through the Frankfurt and Offenbach S-Bahn tunnels.\n\nThe Idstein town bus (''de Idstaaner'') serves 3 lines:\n*221 Railway station\u2013Eisenbach\u2013Taubenberg\u2013G\u00e4nsberg\u2013ZOB Schulgasse\u2013Railway station (formerly 401)\n*222 Railway station\u2013ZOB Schulgasse\u2013G\u00e4nsberg\u2013Taubenberg\u2013Eisenbach\u2013Railway station (formerly 402)\n*223 (booster line) Railway station\u2013Dasbach\u2013Heftrich\u2013Niederrod (formerly 403)\n\nThe town bus is run by ORN (''Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe''). It uses mainly Midi low-floor buses built by [[MAN SE|MAN]]. Most journeys made by bus 223 are arranged [[Demand responsive transport|in response to demand]].\n\nMoreover, many regional buses also serve Idstein, linking important areas not served by the town bus as they go.\n*220 Idstein\u2013[[Niedernhausen]]\u2013Oberjosbach (formerly 5460)\n*224 Idstein\u2013Ehrenbach\u2013G\u00f6rsroth\u2013Idstein\n*225 Railway station\u2013ZOB\u2013Nassauviertel\u2013H\u00fcnstetten\u2013Neuhof\u2013(Wiesbaden)\n*226 Railway station\u2013ZOB\u2013Nassauviertel\u2013Wallrabenstein\u2013Ketternschwalbach (formerly 103)\n*227 G\u00f6rsroth\u2013Idstein\n*230 Idstein\u2013Esch\u2013[[Bad Camberg]] (formerly 5465)\n*233 Idstein/[[Bad Camberg]]\u2013Esch\u2013W\u00fcstems\n*239 Idstein\u2013[[Waldems]]\n*271 ZOB\u2013Railway station\u2013Am W\u00f6rtzgarten\u2013Neuhof\u2013Platte\u2013Wiesbaden main railway station (formerly 5461)\n\nSince timetable changes in July 2007, many journeys, particularly on weekends or in the evening, have been served by [[Demand responsive transport|demand-responsive]] buses.\n\nBus services in the countryside around Idstein (the ''Idsteiner Land'') are likewise run by ORN, which contracts the work out to companies such as Omnibus Mester from Eppstein-Bremthal, Omnibus Weber, Paul-Reisen or Wahl-Reisen (all from H\u00fcnstetten).\n\n===Established businesses===\nRoughly 200 small and midsize businesses, mainly in crafts and retail sales, characterize Idstein's business life; four out of every five have fewer than ten employees.\n\nAmong the bigger businesses in town are, for instance, RS systeme GmbH, Motorola GmbH,<ref>[http://www.motorola.com/content.jsp?globalObjectId=924-1588 Motorola]</ref> [[Jack Wolfskin]], DG-Verlag (distribution and logistics), E. Schmitz Trading & Technical Services GmbH, [[Black & Decker]]/ELU-Gruppe (Elektrowerkzeuge<!--This is part of the business's name. Don't translate it.-->) and Thermoplast + Apparatebau GmbH (thermoplastic [[Injection molding|injection-moulded]] articles).\n\nAnother important employer and factor in the economy is the ''Landeswohlfahrtsverband Hessen'' (Hesse State Welfare Federation) with its SPZ ([[Pediatrics|paediatric]] centre) Kalmenhof, an institution aiding youths and people with handicaps.\n\nAs an historically important and modern middle centre and the heart of the ''Idsteiner Land'', Idstein has at its disposal a multi-faceted retail structure. Its location on the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden \u2013 Limburg railway and the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and a great number of commuters put the great shopping centres in [[Limburg an der Lahn]] and [[Wiesbaden]] as well as those throughout the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Region]] in direct competition with the local retailers.\n\n===Major building projects===\nIn the course of the 2002 [[Hessentag]], many great building (and sometimes conversion) projects were undertaken. The building of the connecting road ''Tiergartenspange'' reduced traffic in the Old Town.\n\nThree new building areas have been developed:\n*Nassau-Viertel (mixed-use area in the town's northwest along ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 275)\n*South bypass road\n*Taunusviertel (in the town's southeast)\n\n====Major building projects since ''Hessentag''====\n*New building work on the ''Grundschule Auf der Au'' ([[primary school]]) and the ''Erich-K\u00e4stner-Schule'' (completed 2005)\n*New building work on the police station (inner town, completed 2006) in connection with conversion work on the ''Amtsgericht'' (court, still in progress)\n*Conversion work on the former ''Geldmacher-Gel\u00e4nde'' (piece of real estate, diagonally across from the Kappus complex): fast-food restaurant ([[Burger King]], not far from the [[McDonald's]], which has been there a while longer), automotive parts dealer and a discount market (completed June/August 2007)\n*New building work on the Campus Europa Hochschule Fresenius (college in the inner town, under construction)\n*New building work on the Tournesol-Allwetterbad (swimming pool) with [[biomass]] [[power station]] in the Nassau-Viertel\n*New building work on the health centre/hospital\n*''Kappus-Anlage'' (at the \"railway station roundabout\"): doctors' centre and discount market (completed 2008)\n*Ramp onto the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] from ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 275 towards [[Frankfurt]] (completed: April 2008)\n\n===Public institutions===\n* Idstein [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau|Protestant]] parish\n* Idstein [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]] Catholic parish\n* Idstein volunteer fire brigade\n* Idstein youth centre\n\n===State institutions===\n* ''Amtsgericht'' (court)\n* [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] (THW)\n* ''Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum Kalmenhof'' (State Welfare Federation institution)\n\n===Education===\n* Taubenbergschule (primary school)\n* Alteburgschule Heftrich (primary school)\n* Franz-Kade-Schule (W\u00f6rsdorf primary school)\n* Limesschule (cooperative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Hauptschule]] and [[Realschule]] branches)\n* Grundschule Auf der Au (primary school)\n* Erich K\u00e4stner-Schule (school for those in need of learning help)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]]schule ([[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]])\n* Hochschule Fresenius (college)\n* Volkshochschule Rheingau-Taunus ([[folk high school]])\n\n===Hospital===\nIn 2008, the hospital moved into a new \u20ac22,000,000, 90-bed building on an {{convert|18000|m2|abbr=on}} plot on Robert-Koch-Stra\u00dfe. The [[States of Germany|state]] provided a subsidy of \u20ac17,200,000 (earlier, \u20ac3,000,000 came from the district, which had forgone part of the buying price for the former district hospitals at Idstein und Bad Schwalbach).\n\n===Swimming pool===\nA partly prefabricated all-weather pool came into being (after some delays) in spring 2010 in the Nassau-Viertel for \u20ac19,000,000. The town is subsidizing the more than \u20ac2,500,000 plot on ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 275 and the yearly \u20ac500,000 operating costs. For the manufacturer, it is, with its cupola, biomass power plant and natural bathing pond a demonstration project near [[Frankfurt Airport]].\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Buildings===\n\n====Unionskirche====\n{{Main|Unionskirche, Idstein}}\nThe ''Unionskirche'', whose outer appearance is quite plain, holds within its splendour. The building history of the church, originally consecrated to Saint [[Martin of Tours]] as a monastery church, reaches back to the 13th century. In the mid 14th century a new building in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style arose, which was remodeled in the 17th century.\n<gallery>\nFile:Unionskirche Idstein facing altar.JPG|Inside of the [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] towards the main altar.\nFile:Unionskirche Idstein organ and ceiling.jpg|[[Walcker Orgelbau|Walcker organ]] and ceiling\nFile:IdsteinUnionskircheDeckengemaelde.jpg|Ceiling\nFile:IdsteinUnionskircheSeitenkapelle.jpg|''Reiterch\u00f6rlein''\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1553 Idstein turned [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. The church was decorated in Baroque style in the 17th century, unusually rich for a Protestant church. The ceiling in the main nave was thoroughly covered with large-scale oil paintings from the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] school of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. Several well known works by Rubens form the basis of scenes from the life of Christ on the walls and ceiling; for example ''The Wedding at Cana''<ref name=\"cana\">\n{{cite web|title=Anordnung der Wand- und Deckenbilder in der Unionskirche Idstein (Layout of the wall- and ceiling-paintings in the Unionchurch, Idstein)|publisher=Evangelische Kirchengemeinde Idstein|url=http://www.ev-kirche-idstein.de/web/pages/unionskirche/bilder.php|access-date=15 June 2011|language=German|quote=Click on numbered descriptions to see images.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112803/http://www.ev-kirche-idstein.de/web/pages/unionskirche/bilder.php|archive-date=22 July 2011|df=}}</ref> on the south wall is largely based on Rubens's painting ''The Feast of Herod''<ref name=\"natgaledin\">{{cite news\n |title=The Feast of Herod\n |publisher=National Galleries of Scotland Online Collections\n |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_search/4:324/results/0/5382/\n |accessdate=13 January 2007\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608075558/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_search/4:324/results/0/5382/\n |archive-date=8 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref> which hangs today in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe church's name refers to the church union declared in Idstein in 1817 whereby the [[Protestant Church|Reformed]] and [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] churches in the [[Duchy of Nassau]] united to the [[Protestant Church in Nassau]], today the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]].\n\n====Residence palace====\n[[File:Idstein-Schloss.jpg|thumb|''Residenzschloss'']]\nThe [[Renaissance]]-style ''Schloss'' was built in 1614\u20131634 by Jost and Henrich Heer (H\u00f6er) for Count Ludwig (d. 1627) and his son Count Johann (d. 1677) by incorporating older building materials. It stands on a craggy massif between the town's two brooks. It is believed that the crags on which the palace is built were already built up in the 11th century.\n\nA bridged gap in the crags separates it from the old castle area from the 11th century; through this gap today runs an important road.\n\nDuring the time when the last Idstein prince, Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein (1665\u20131721), was ruling, the building was given its interior design under [[Maximilian von Welsch]]'s guidance. The now partly missing ceiling stucco was done by Carlo Maria Pozzi. At the main entrance door is a great alliance coat of arms of Count Johann and his consort from about 1635.\n\nThe palace has been home to the ''Pestalozzischule'' since 1946 and may be visited on guided tours.\n[[File:IdsteinBurgHexenturm.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Idstein Castle]] and ''Hexenturm'']]\n\n====Castle and ''Hexenturm''====\n[[File:IdsteinGedenktafel.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque to the victims of the witch trials]]\nThe castle in the area stretching from the gateway arch building on the town side to the bridge over to the ''Schloss'' arose between 1497 and 1588. With the remodelling done on the palace itself in the 17th century, this area also underwent far-reaching changes, partly losing its defensive functions, which, it is worth noting, were no longer up to date anyway.\n\nThe castle's [[keep]], known as the ''Hexenturm'', {{convert|42|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall, walls more than {{convert|3|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick, even given overall diameter of just under {{convert|12|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, is Idstein's oldest building. [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] borings show that work began on the tower as early as 1170 (not, as had long been assumed, about 1350). It received its \"butter churn\" shape, built in stages, about 1500. (Building researchers see in it a rare time capsule, because in the 20th century, almost nothing was changed beyond the last work in 1963, which entailed nothing more than some new plastering outside and small touch-ups with cement inside).\n\nNo [[witch]]es or [[warlock]]s were ever imprisoned in the ''Hexenturm''. However, on a cliff wall at the foot of the keep, a plaque has been placed in memory of those murdered after being accused of witchcraft. Idstein was notorious for its witch trials about 1676.\n[[File:Idstein Killingerhaus-Fassade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Killingerhaus'']]\n\n====Other historic buildings====\n[[File:Idstein-Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Town Hall with gateway arch building]]\nThe old town core is small. It is distinguished by a many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings, some opulently painted and decorated, in which the Rhenish influences on the Hessian-Franconian timber-frame building style can already be seen. Therefore, Idstein is part of the German Framework Road. The town core stretches between the castle area with its ''Hexenturm'' and the ''H\u00f6erhof'', the representative timber-frame building built in 1620\u20131626 by the palace building master on the heights across from the ''Schloss''. The painter Ernst Toepfer bought the property in 1911 and restored the building. Today, the ''H\u00f6erhof'' is a stylish hotel and restaurant with an idyllic inner courtyard.\n\nRight at the Nassau castle's gateway arch building, standing over K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (''Rathaus'') from 1698, in a rather odd way over the passage that separates the Old Town from the castle. Also worth mentioning is the carillon (''Glockenspiel''). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934.\n\nK\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz is seamlessly ringed by representative timber-frame houses, mainly dating from about 1600. To the Town Hall's left stands the ''Schiefes Haus'' (\"Crooked House\"), which was renovated a few years ago, and which Nicolay, the major of the town militia, had built in 1527. On the way out of the square towards the ''Unionskirche'', is the richly adorned ''Killingerhaus'' built in 1527, which has served as a museum and tourism office since 1987. It is one of Germany's most important timber-frame houses with regards to art history. According to one story, the building was originally built in [[Strasbourg]], and when the owner moved to Idstein, he brought the house with him.\n\nThe rest of the old downtown core is also characterized by its many timber-frame houses and estate complexes from the 16th and 17th centuries, some of which have been lavishly renovated. This is particularly so along the Obergasse (\"Upper Lane\"), which leads from K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz out of the town and meets the old town wall on the H\u00f6erhof heights. Somewhat below that stands the ''Stockheimer Hof'', which was built in the late 16th century as the seat of the Lords of Stockheim. After they died out, ownership passed to the family von Calm between 1768 and 1776, giving the property on which it stands its current name, Kalmenhof. Until 2005, the timber-frame building was being used by the ''Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum SPZ Kalmenhof''. On the way from the ''Killingerhaus'' to the ''H\u00f6erhof'', one house has a humorous [[Dog Latin]] inscription. ''\"Sita vsvilate inis taberce inis\"'' (which is actually a misspelling of ''Sieht aus wie Latein, ist aber keines'' \u2013 \"Looks like Latin, but is not\").\n\nAs a last witness to the former leather industry, the ''Gerberhaus'' (\"Tanners' House\") stands at L\u00f6herplatz below the ''Unionskirche''; it is the former storage shed on the W\u00f6rsbach. L\u00f6herplatz was, beginning in the [[Middle Ages]] the place where the tanneries and leather processing works were found owing to the demand for water, and also the need to have the works outside town given the attendant stench that went forth from them. The ''Gerberhaus'', after a thorough renovation, nowadays serves as an exhibition and cabaret event venue.\n\nStretching east of the old town core from the marketplace, which itself dates from about 1700, is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] town expansion. Its streets match the ideals of town building at that time with right-angled intersections, the timber-frame houses lining them pragmatic and far less decorated than in the town core. Building \"sins\" and great changes have been avoided, and instead, restoration is what was more often done, thereby preserving an impressive, unbroken ensemble of these buildings.\n\n====St. Martin====\n[[File:St. Martin, Idstein, service.jpg|thumb|Service in St. Martin, 2011]]\n{{Main|St. Martin, Idstein}}\nAs the former neogothic Catholic parish church St. Magdalena was too small for a growing population after [[World War II]], a new church St. Martin was built instead, designed by the architect [[:de:Johannes Krahn|Johannes Krahn]], resembling a [[Basilica#Christianization of the Roman basilica|Roman basilica]] with open sandstone walls and a band of windows below the ceiling, consecrated in 1964.<ref>[http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=103&type=1 St. Martin church] on the St. Martin website (in German, pictured)</ref> In 2006 a new organ was installed by [[Orgelbau Mebold]].\n\n===Limes===\n[[File:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|Map of Upper Germanic Limes]]\nThe municipal area was crossed by the [[Limes Germanicus]], a line of frontier forts begun in AD 86 by the Romans which stretched from near [[Bonn]] on the [[Rhine]] to near [[Regensburg]] on the [[Danube]]. It divided the [[Roman Empire]] from the unconquered [[Germanic tribes]]. The area of the town that stands today lay on the Germanic side. Bearing obvious witness to the Limes is a replica of a watchtower towards Niedernhausen near Dasbach on the Dasbacher H\u00f6he (heights). Even the Dasbach churchtower supposedly stands on the foundation of a Roman watchtower. Within the limits of neighbouring [[Taunusstein]] is likewise found such a replica near Orlen, right beside the remains of the [[Castra|castrum]] ''Zugmantel''.\n\nNear the outlying centre of Heftrich stood the castrum ''Alteburg'', of which, however, nothing more is to be seen.\n\nOn 15 July 2005, the Upper-Germanic-Rhaetian Limes (the Limes Germanicus) was raised to [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n===Regular events===\nAs a yearly event highlight, the ''Hessen-[[Jazz]] Festival'' or more recently ''Idstein JazzFestival'' has been drawing thousands of visitors for 20 years into the Old Town's laneways. On three days, during the first weekend in the Hesse summer holidays, up to 75 different jazz groups on a dozen stages play from Friday evening to Sunday live in an open-air concert.\n\nThe Unionskirche is the location for choral concerts of the [[Idsteiner Kantorei]] conducted by [[Carsten Koch (musician)|Carsten Koch]] twice a year, such as Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' and Bach's ''[[Christmas Oratorio (Bach)|Weihnachtsoratorium]]'' in 2009. For the annual [[European Heritage Days]] the \"Nassauische Kammerphilharmonie\" has performed a \"Sinfoniekonzert zum Tag des offenen Denkmals\", including a series of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s symphonies. The [[Rheingau Musik Festival]] staged concerts here with [[Elizabeth Parcells]], [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]] and [[ensemble amarcord]], among others.\n\nIn the church [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]] an annual choral concert is performed by the combined choirs Chor St. Martin and the chamber choir Martinis, conducted by Franz Fink, such as Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' in 1998 with [[Elisabeth Scholl]], [[Andreas Scholl]] and [[Max van Egmond]] and again in 2009 with [[Andreas Pruys]] and [[Klaus Mertens]].<ref>[http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/index.php?id=512&type=1 Matth\u00e4uspassion] on the St. Martin website (in German)</ref> The concert of 2011 was Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', with soloists [[Katia Plaschka]], Andreas Scholl, [[Ulrich Cordes]] and [[Markus Flaig]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=809&type=1 |title=Mit Hingabe und Pr\u00e4zision |language=German |author=Beke Heeren-Pradt |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2011 |publisher=Wiesbadener Tagblatt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331022114/http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=809&type=1 |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other concerts in the church have included music of [[Graham Waterhouse]], the duo propram of [[Giora Feidman]] and organist [[Matthias Eisenberg]] in 2008 and a concert of [[Kalevi Kiviniemi]] in 2010.\n\nAlthough the town of Idstein hosts only a small vineyard, whose wines are not for sale but poured at special occasions, there is nonetheless a yearly wine festival, mainly presenting wines from the near [[Rheingau]].\n\nEvery other year, in the spring, the ''Idsteiner Hexenmarkt'' (Witches' Market) is held in the castle and palace area, an event with [[Middle Ages|medieval]] crafts and entertainment.\n\nIn the summer, from June to August on the third day of each of those months, the ''Alteburger Markt'' is held in Idstein-Heftrich, on the site of the Roman castrum Alteburg.\n\nThe youth centre in Idstein offers a monthly event plan with hip hop, metal, DJ night and punk rock, offering at irregular intervals, for instance live concerts by local bands.\n\nSince 2003, the \"Monkey Jump Festival\" has been held annually. A great number of bands perform in the town's various pubs and restaurants during the festival.\n\nSince 2004, the Idstein [[International Women's Day|Women's Day]] ''Frauen in Balance'' (\"Women in Balance\") has been held annually at the ''Gerberhaus'', in collaboration with the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis equality commissioner.\n\n==Famous people==\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n[[File:Wenck, Friedrich August Wilhelm.jpg|thumb|150px|Friedrich August Wilhelm Wenck (1810)]]\n*[[Henriette Charlotte of Nassau-Idstein]] (1693\u20131734), consort of [[Maurice Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg]]\n* Henriette Maria Luise von Hayn (1722\u20131782), poet\n* [[Johann Andreas Benignus Bergstr\u00e4sser]] (1732-1812), entomologist and Rector of the University of Hanover\n* [[Helfrich Bernhard Wenck]] (1739\u20131803), historian and educator \n* [[Friedrich August Wilhelm Wenck]] (1741\u20131810), historian\n* Wilhelm Snell (1789\u20131851), professor of jurisprudence and politician in Switzerland\n* Wilhelm August Kobb\u00e9 (1802\u20131881), diplomat\n* Marx L\u00f6wenstein (1824\u20131889), German-American multimillionaire\n* [[Karl Hill]] (1831\u20131893), operatic baritone, who created Klingsor in ''[[Parsifal]]'' in [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]]\n* Carl Jakob Frankenbach (1861\u20131937), painter and illustrator\n* Ferdinand Abt (1877\u20131962), sculptor\n* Walther Schultze (1893\u20131970), dermatologist\n* Klaus-Peter Sattler (born 1941), composer\n* Gerhard Krum (born 1947), politician\n* Patrick van Hecke, alias Dirrrty Franz, namesake of the German [[crunk]] group [[:de:Dirrrty Franz & die b-Side Boyz|Dirrrty Franz & die B-Side Boyz]]\n* Stefanie Werner (born 1970), renowned architect in New York\n\n===People connected with Idstein===\n[[File:William August Kobb\u00e9.JPG|thumb|150px|William August Kobb\u00e9 (1900)]]\n* [[Arnold I, Count of Laurenburg]] (died ''c.'' 1148), was from 1124 [[Vogt]] of Idstein.\n* [[Adolf, King of Germany|Adolf of Nassau]] (''c.'' 1255\u20131298), used Idstein Castle as one of his two main residences before 1292, when he became [[King of the Romans]]\n* [[Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg]] (''c.'' 1255\u20131313), was the consort of Adolf of Nassau\n* [[Sebastian Stoskopff]] (1597\u20131657), Alsatian painter, lived and died in Idstein\n* [[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]], mathematician, geologist, and engineer, attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Idstein\n* Johann Baptist Friedrich Anton von Franqu\u00e9 (1796\u20131865), physician\n* [[William August Kobb\u00e9]] (1840\u20131931), U.S. Army general, was the son of Wilhelm Kobb\u00e9, born in Idstein \n* [[Gustav Kobb\u00e9]] (1857\u20131918), American author of ''[[The Complete Opera Book]]'', was another son of Wilhelm Kobb\u00e9\n* [[Ernst Toepfer]] (1877\u20131955), painter, lived for parts of his life in Idstein and died there\n* Wolf Meyer-Erlach (1891\u20131982), theologian, college teacher, university rector;

Because of its well preserved historical Altstadt (Old Town) it is part of the ''Deutsche Fachwerkstra\u00dfe'' ([[German Timber-Frame Road]]), connecting towns with fine [[Fachwerk (Germany)|fachwerk]] buildings and houses.<ref>[http://www.deutsche-fachwerkstrasse.de/uk/cont.php3 German Half-Timbered House Road] website, Idstein in the section \"From the Lahn Valley to the Rheingau Region</ref> In 2002, the town hosted the 42nd [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nIdstein lies in the [[Taunus]] mountain range, about {{convert|16|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Wiesbaden]]. The town's landmark is the ''Hexenturm'' ([[Witches' Tower]]), a 12th-century [[bergfried]] and part of [[Idstein Castle]].\n\nThe Old Town is found between the two brooks running through town, the Wolfsbach in the east and the W\u00f6rsbach in the west, on a high ridge reaching up to {{convert|400|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. This comes to an end in the Old Town's north end with the castle and palace crags, behind which the two brooks run together. On the Wolfsbach, remnants of the like-named, now forsaken village can still be made out. The estate agent Gassenbach in the town's south goes back to an old settlement called Gassenbach; for the last few years, it has belonged to the ''Dom\u00e4ne Mechtildshausen'',<ref>[http://wjw.aisys.ag/seiten/deutsch/domaene.php Dom\u00e4ne Mechtildshausen] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110531152453/http://wjw.aisys.ag/seiten/deutsch/domaene.php |date=2011-05-31 }} website (in German)</ref> an [[organic farming]] operation.\n\nWest of town, beyond the W\u00f6rsbach valley, lies another high ridge with peaks ranging from the Hohe Kanzel ({{convert|592|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the Ro\u00dfberg ({{convert|426|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the R\u00fcgert ({{convert|402|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to the Rosenkippel ({{convert|379|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}); to the south, the Galgenberg ({{convert|348|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) forms another high area over to the Dasbach Heath.

With about 25,700 inhabitants, Idstein is the second biggest town in the district (after [[Taunusstein]]).\n\n==History==\nIdstein, which had its first documentary mention in 1102 as ''Etichenstein'', was granted town and market rights in 1287 by King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]]. Besides the ''Hexenturm'' near the old Nassau castle that has already been mentioned, the town has a [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] town centre with many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings. The town's oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410.\n\nFrom the documentary mention in 1102 until 1721, Idstein was, with interruptions, residence of the Counts of [[House of Nassau|Nassau-Idstein]] and other Nassau lines. One of the Counts, [[Adolf of Germany]], was, as a compromise candidate, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1292 to 1298, later falling in battle against the anti-king [[Albert I of Germany|Albrecht I of Habsburg]].\n\nThe Nassau Counts' holdings were subdivided many times among heirs, with the parts being brought together again whenever a line died out. This yielded an older Nassau-Idstein line from 1480 to 1509, later merging once again with Nassau-Wiesbaden and Nassau-Weilburg and, from 1629 to 1721, a newer Nassau-Idstein line.\n\n[[File:Idstein De Merian Hassiae.jpg|thumb|400px|Idstein \u2013 Extract from ''Topographia Hassiae'' by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] the Younger, 1655]]\nIn the 17th century, Count [[Johann (Nassau-Idstein)|Johann of Nassau-Idstein]] persecuted witches in Idstein.<ref>[http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-hexenverfolgung.htm Die Hexenverfolgung in Idstein] nassau-info.de</ref>\n\nIn 1721, Idstein passed to Nassau-Ottweiler, and in 1728 to Nassau-Usingen, thereby losing its status as a residence town, although it became the seat of the Nassau Archives and of an ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Oberamt]]''.\n\nNassau-Usingen was united with Nassau-Weilburg in 1806 into the [[Duchy of Nassau]], becoming a member of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. After the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866, [[Prussia]] annexed the Duchy as the Prussian province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nThe residential palace from the 17th century is used by the ''Pestalozzischule'' as a school building. It was expanded with a new building below the palace.\n\nFrom the late 18th century to the mid 20th, Idstein was the centre of an important leather industry. During the [[Second World War]], many women became [[Arbeitseinsatz|forced labour]] for work in the tanneries. In 1959, the dominant tannery in the middle of the town core was shut down for economic reasons. The lands right at the edge of the Old Town lay empty and were used until the 1980s as a carpark. Today, new shops and apartments surround the L\u00f6herplatz, which is now a marketplace.\n\nThe private ''Kalmenhof'' clinic in Idstein was drawn into the [[National Socialism|Nazi]] [[Euthanasia]] programme. Under [[Action T4]], the Kalmenhof served as a way station for the \"killing institute\" at [[Hadamar Clinic|Hadamar]]. After the gassings at Hadamar came to an end in the face of public protests, especially from the churches, the Kalmenhof itself, in the course of ''[[Karl Brandt|Aktion Brandt]]'', became a killing institute; patients here were murdered with poison injections.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nShortly after the war, reports of young wards being mishandled came to light.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/specials/wissen/index.jsp?rubrik=6558&key=standard_document_3613168 |title=HR Online \u00fcber den Kalmenhof |access-date=2008-11-17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060519070211/http://www.hr-online.de/website/specials/wissen/index.jsp?rubrik=6558&key=standard_document_3613168 |archive-date=2006-05-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.vaeter-aktuell.papaserver.de/politik/politik-1949-1994/2004-Heimkinder-Kongress.htm Presseberichte Heimkinder-Kongress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218204612/http://www.vaeter-aktuell.papaserver.de/politik/politik-1949-1994/2004-Heimkinder-Kongress.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}</ref>\n\nEleven formerly independent villages were merged as of 1971 into Idstein, under the framework of municipal reform.\n\n==Population development==\n[[File:St Martin Idstein.JPG|thumb|300px|View from the Hexenturm to [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]], 2010]]\n<small>(as of 31 December)</small>\n{|\n!Year!!Population\n|-\n|1998\n|align=\"right\" |22,346\n|-\n|1999\n|align=\"right\" |22,611\n|-\n|2000\n|align=\"right\" |22,611\n|-\n|2001\n|align=\"right\" |22,786\n|-\n|2002\n|align=\"right\" |22,998\n|-\n|2003\n|align=\"right\" |22,893\n|-\n|2004\n|align=\"right\" |22,894\n|-\n|2005\n|align=\"right\" |23,229\n|-\n|2006\n|align=\"right\" |25,696\n|}\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Azure a round castle wall embattled with two portcullises open, the wall enclosing two towers, the whole Or, with peaked roofs gules, between the portcullises an inescutcheon azure with a lion rampant Or armed and langued gules among six billets Or.\n\nThe [[inescutcheon]] is the arms borne by the [[House of Nassau]].

However, the traffic volume in the town core is still very high.\n\nAt intersections in the town core, [[roundabout]]s have improved the traffic flow, in some places noticeably. The ''S\u00fcdtangente'' (south \"tangent\" road), which had been planned since 1981, was completed in 2009, reducing traffic in town further. It links two new development areas. Of the \u20ac9,000,000 for the project, roughly 60% was borne by the [[States of Germany|state]] of Hesse.\n\n===Local transport===\nWithin Idstein town limits are two railway stations on the [[Main-Lahn Railway]] (''Main-Lahn-Bahn''), Idstein and W\u00f6rsdorf. There are hourly trains serving the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden\u2013Niedernhausen\u2013Limburg run into the evening. In [[Niedernhausen]] there is also a transfer point with S-Bahn line S2 towards [[Dietzenbach]] through the Frankfurt and Offenbach S-Bahn tunnels.\n\nThe Idstein town bus (''de Idstaaner'') serves 3 lines:\n*221 Railway station\u2013Eisenbach\u2013Taubenberg\u2013G\u00e4nsberg\u2013ZOB Schulgasse\u2013Railway station (formerly 401)\n*222 Railway station\u2013ZOB Schulgasse\u2013G\u00e4nsberg\u2013Taubenberg\u2013Eisenbach\u2013Railway station (formerly 402)\n*223 (booster line) Railway station\u2013Dasbach\u2013Heftrich\u2013Niederrod (formerly 403)\n\nThe town bus is run by ORN (''Omnibusverkehr Rhein-Nahe''). It uses mainly Midi low-floor buses built by [[MAN SE|MAN]]. Most journeys made by bus 223 are arranged [[Demand responsive transport|in response to demand]].\n\nMoreover, many regional buses also serve Idstein, linking important areas not served by the town bus as they go.\n*220 Idstein\u2013[[Niedernhausen]]\u2013Oberjosbach (formerly 5460)\n*224 Idstein\u2013Ehrenbach\u2013G\u00f6rsroth\u2013Idstein\n*225 Railway station\u2013ZOB\u2013Nassauviertel\u2013H\u00fcnstetten\u2013Neuhof\u2013(Wiesbaden)\n*226 Railway station\u2013ZOB\u2013Nassauviertel\u2013Wallrabenstein\u2013Ketternschwalbach (formerly 103)\n*227 G\u00f6rsroth\u2013Idstein\n*230 Idstein\u2013Esch\u2013[[Bad Camberg]] (formerly 5465)\n*233 Idstein/[[Bad Camberg]]\u2013Esch\u2013W\u00fcstems\n*239 Idstein\u2013[[Waldems]]\n*271 ZOB\u2013Railway station\u2013Am W\u00f6rtzgarten\u2013Neuhof\u2013Platte\u2013Wiesbaden main railway station (formerly 5461)\n\nSince timetable changes in July 2007, many journeys, particularly on weekends or in the evening, have been served by [[Demand responsive transport|demand-responsive]] buses.\n\nBus services in the countryside around Idstein (the ''Idsteiner Land'') are likewise run by ORN, which contracts the work out to companies such as Omnibus Mester from Eppstein-Bremthal, Omnibus Weber, Paul-Reisen or Wahl-Reisen (all from H\u00fcnstetten).\n\n===Established businesses===\nRoughly 200 small and midsize businesses, mainly in crafts and retail sales, characterize Idstein's business life; four out of every five have fewer than ten employees.\n\nAmong the bigger businesses in town are, for instance, RS systeme GmbH, Motorola GmbH,<ref>[http://www.motorola.com/content.jsp?globalObjectId=924-1588 Motorola]</ref> [[Jack Wolfskin]], DG-Verlag (distribution and logistics), E. Schmitz Trading & Technical Services GmbH, [[Black & Decker]]/ELU-Gruppe (Elektrowerkzeuge<!--This is part of the business's name. Don't translate it.-->) and Thermoplast + Apparatebau GmbH (thermoplastic [[Injection molding|injection-moulded]] articles).\n\nAnother important employer and factor in the economy is the ''Landeswohlfahrtsverband Hessen'' (Hesse State Welfare Federation) with its SPZ ([[Pediatrics|paediatric]] centre) Kalmenhof, an institution aiding youths and people with handicaps.\n\nAs an historically important and modern middle centre and the heart of the ''Idsteiner Land'', Idstein has at its disposal a multi-faceted retail structure. Its location on the Frankfurt/Wiesbaden \u2013 Limburg railway and the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and a great number of commuters put the great shopping centres in [[Limburg an der Lahn]] and [[Wiesbaden]] as well as those throughout the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Region]] in direct competition with the local retailers.\n\n===Major building projects===\nIn the course of the 2002 [[Hessentag]], many great building (and sometimes conversion) projects were undertaken. The building of the connecting road ''Tiergartenspange'' reduced traffic in the Old Town.\n\nThree new building areas have been developed:\n*Nassau-Viertel (mixed-use area in the town's northwest along ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 275)\n*South bypass road\n*Taunusviertel (in the town's southeast)\n\n====Major building projects since ''Hessentag''====\n*New building work on the ''Grundschule Auf der Au'' ([[primary school]]) and the ''Erich-K\u00e4stner-Schule'' (completed 2005)\n*New building work on the police station (inner town, completed 2006) in connection with conversion work on the ''Amtsgericht'' (court, still in progress)\n*Conversion work on the former ''Geldmacher-Gel\u00e4nde'' (piece of real estate, diagonally across from the Kappus complex): fast-food restaurant ([[Burger King]], not far from the [[McDonald's]], which has been there a while longer), automotive parts dealer and a discount market (completed June/August 2007)\n*New building work on the Campus Europa Hochschule Fresenius (college in the inner town, under construction)\n*New building work on the Tournesol-Allwetterbad (swimming pool) with [[biomass]] [[power station]] in the Nassau-Viertel\n*New building work on the health centre/hospital\n*''Kappus-Anlage'' (at the \"railway station roundabout\"): doctors' centre and discount market (completed 2008)\n*Ramp onto the [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] from ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 275 towards [[Frankfurt]] (completed: April 2008)\n\n===Public institutions===\n* Idstein [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau|Protestant]] parish\n* Idstein [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]] Catholic parish\n* Idstein volunteer fire brigade\n* Idstein youth centre\n\n===State institutions===\n* ''Amtsgericht'' (court)\n* [[Technisches Hilfswerk]] (THW)\n* ''Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum Kalmenhof'' (State Welfare Federation institution)\n\n===Education===\n* Taubenbergschule (primary school)\n* Alteburgschule Heftrich (primary school)\n* Franz-Kade-Schule (W\u00f6rsdorf primary school)\n* Limesschule (cooperative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Hauptschule]] and [[Realschule]] branches)\n* Grundschule Auf der Au (primary school)\n* Erich K\u00e4stner-Schule (school for those in need of learning help)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]]schule ([[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]])\n* Hochschule Fresenius (college)\n* Volkshochschule Rheingau-Taunus ([[folk high school]])\n\n===Hospital===\nIn 2008, the hospital moved into a new \u20ac22,000,000, 90-bed building on an {{convert|18000|m2|abbr=on}} plot on Robert-Koch-Stra\u00dfe. The [[States of Germany|state]] provided a subsidy of \u20ac17,200,000 (earlier, \u20ac3,000,000 came from the district, which had forgone part of the buying price for the former district hospitals at Idstein und Bad Schwalbach).\n\n===Swimming pool===\nA partly prefabricated all-weather pool came into being (after some delays) in spring 2010 in the Nassau-Viertel for \u20ac19,000,000. The town is subsidizing the more than \u20ac2,500,000 plot on ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 275 and the yearly \u20ac500,000 operating costs. For the manufacturer, it is, with its cupola, biomass power plant and natural bathing pond a demonstration project near [[Frankfurt Airport]].\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Buildings===\n\n====Unionskirche====\n{{Main|Unionskirche, Idstein}}\nThe ''Unionskirche'', whose outer appearance is quite plain, holds within its splendour. The building history of the church, originally consecrated to Saint [[Martin of Tours]] as a monastery church, reaches back to the 13th century. In the mid 14th century a new building in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style arose, which was remodeled in the 17th century.\n<gallery>\nFile:Unionskirche Idstein facing altar.JPG|Inside of the [[Unionskirche, Idstein|Unionskirche]] towards the main altar.\nFile:Unionskirche Idstein organ and ceiling.jpg|[[Walcker Orgelbau|Walcker organ]] and ceiling\nFile:IdsteinUnionskircheDeckengemaelde.jpg|Ceiling\nFile:IdsteinUnionskircheSeitenkapelle.jpg|''Reiterch\u00f6rlein''\n</gallery>\n\nIn 1553 Idstein turned [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. The church was decorated in Baroque style in the 17th century, unusually rich for a Protestant church. The ceiling in the main nave was thoroughly covered with large-scale oil paintings from the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch]] school of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. Several well known works by Rubens form the basis of scenes from the life of Christ on the walls and ceiling; for example ''The Wedding at Cana''<ref name=\"cana\">\n{{cite web|title=Anordnung der Wand- und Deckenbilder in der Unionskirche Idstein (Layout of the wall- and ceiling-paintings in the Unionchurch, Idstein)|publisher=Evangelische Kirchengemeinde Idstein|url=http://www.ev-kirche-idstein.de/web/pages/unionskirche/bilder.php|access-date=15 June 2011|language=German|quote=Click on numbered descriptions to see images.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112803/http://www.ev-kirche-idstein.de/web/pages/unionskirche/bilder.php|archive-date=22 July 2011|df=}}</ref> on the south wall is largely based on Rubens's painting ''The Feast of Herod''<ref name=\"natgaledin\">{{cite news\n |title=The Feast of Herod\n |publisher=National Galleries of Scotland Online Collections\n |url=http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_search/4:324/results/0/5382/\n |accessdate=13 January 2007\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608075558/http://www.nationalgalleries.org/index.php/collection/online_search/4:324/results/0/5382/\n |archive-date=8 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref> which hangs today in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe church's name refers to the church union declared in Idstein in 1817 whereby the [[Protestant Church|Reformed]] and [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] churches in the [[Duchy of Nassau]] united to the [[Protestant Church in Nassau]], today the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]].\n\n====Residence palace====\n[[File:Idstein-Schloss.jpg|thumb|''Residenzschloss'']]\nThe [[Renaissance]]-style ''Schloss'' was built in 1614\u20131634 by Jost and Henrich Heer (H\u00f6er) for Count Ludwig (d. 1627) and his son Count Johann (d. 1677) by incorporating older building materials. It stands on a craggy massif between the town's two brooks. It is believed that the crags on which the palace is built were already built up in the 11th century.\n\nA bridged gap in the crags separates it from the old castle area from the 11th century; through this gap today runs an important road.\n\nDuring the time when the last Idstein prince, Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein (1665\u20131721), was ruling, the building was given its interior design under [[Maximilian von Welsch]]'s guidance. The now partly missing ceiling stucco was done by Carlo Maria Pozzi. At the main entrance door is a great alliance coat of arms of Count Johann and his consort from about 1635.\n\nThe palace has been home to the ''Pestalozzischule'' since 1946 and may be visited on guided tours.\n[[File:IdsteinBurgHexenturm.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Idstein Castle]] and ''Hexenturm'']]\n\n====Castle and ''Hexenturm''====\n[[File:IdsteinGedenktafel.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque to the victims of the witch trials]]\nThe castle in the area stretching from the gateway arch building on the town side to the bridge over to the ''Schloss'' arose between 1497 and 1588. With the remodelling done on the palace itself in the 17th century, this area also underwent far-reaching changes, partly losing its defensive functions, which, it is worth noting, were no longer up to date anyway.\n\nThe castle's [[keep]], known as the ''Hexenturm'', {{convert|42|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall, walls more than {{convert|3|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} thick, even given overall diameter of just under {{convert|12|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}, is Idstein's oldest building. [[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] borings show that work began on the tower as early as 1170 (not, as had long been assumed, about 1350). It received its \"butter churn\" shape, built in stages, about 1500. (Building researchers see in it a rare time capsule, because in the 20th century, almost nothing was changed beyond the last work in 1963, which entailed nothing more than some new plastering outside and small touch-ups with cement inside).\n\nNo [[witch]]es or [[warlock]]s were ever imprisoned in the ''Hexenturm''. However, on a cliff wall at the foot of the keep, a plaque has been placed in memory of those murdered after being accused of witchcraft. Idstein was notorious for its witch trials about 1676.\n[[File:Idstein Killingerhaus-Fassade.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Killingerhaus'']]\n\n====Other historic buildings====\n[[File:Idstein-Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Town Hall with gateway arch building]]\nThe old town core is small. It is distinguished by a many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] buildings, some opulently painted and decorated, in which the Rhenish influences on the Hessian-Franconian timber-frame building style can already be seen. Therefore, Idstein is part of the German Framework Road. The town core stretches between the castle area with its ''Hexenturm'' and the ''H\u00f6erhof'', the representative timber-frame building built in 1620\u20131626 by the palace building master on the heights across from the ''Schloss''. The painter Ernst Toepfer bought the property in 1911 and restored the building. Today, the ''H\u00f6erhof'' is a stylish hotel and restaurant with an idyllic inner courtyard.\n\nRight at the Nassau castle's gateway arch building, standing over K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz, is the Town Hall (''Rathaus'') from 1698, in a rather odd way over the passage that separates the Old Town from the castle. Also worth mentioning is the carillon (''Glockenspiel''). A rockslide from the crags destroyed the Town Hall in 1928, but it was rebuilt between 1932 and 1934.\n\nK\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz is seamlessly ringed by representative timber-frame houses, mainly dating from about 1600. To the Town Hall's left stands the ''Schiefes Haus'' (\"Crooked House\"), which was renovated a few years ago, and which Nicolay, the major of the town militia, had built in 1527. On the way out of the square towards the ''Unionskirche'', is the richly adorned ''Killingerhaus'' built in 1527, which has served as a museum and tourism office since 1987. It is one of Germany's most important timber-frame houses with regards to art history. According to one story, the building was originally built in [[Strasbourg]], and when the owner moved to Idstein, he brought the house with him.\n\nThe rest of the old downtown core is also characterized by its many timber-frame houses and estate complexes from the 16th and 17th centuries, some of which have been lavishly renovated. This is particularly so along the Obergasse (\"Upper Lane\"), which leads from K\u00f6nig-Adolf-Platz out of the town and meets the old town wall on the H\u00f6erhof heights. Somewhat below that stands the ''Stockheimer Hof'', which was built in the late 16th century as the seat of the Lords of Stockheim. After they died out, ownership passed to the family von Calm between 1768 and 1776, giving the property on which it stands its current name, Kalmenhof. Until 2005, the timber-frame building was being used by the ''Sozialp\u00e4dagogisches Zentrum SPZ Kalmenhof''. On the way from the ''Killingerhaus'' to the ''H\u00f6erhof'', one house has a humorous [[Dog Latin]] inscription. ''\"Sita vsvilate inis taberce inis\"'' (which is actually a misspelling of ''Sieht aus wie Latein, ist aber keines'' \u2013 \"Looks like Latin, but is not\").\n\nAs a last witness to the former leather industry, the ''Gerberhaus'' (\"Tanners' House\") stands at L\u00f6herplatz below the ''Unionskirche''; it is the former storage shed on the W\u00f6rsbach. L\u00f6herplatz was, beginning in the [[Middle Ages]] the place where the tanneries and leather processing works were found owing to the demand for water, and also the need to have the works outside town given the attendant stench that went forth from them. The ''Gerberhaus'', after a thorough renovation, nowadays serves as an exhibition and cabaret event venue.\n\nStretching east of the old town core from the marketplace, which itself dates from about 1700, is a [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] town expansion. Its streets match the ideals of town building at that time with right-angled intersections, the timber-frame houses lining them pragmatic and far less decorated than in the town core. Building \"sins\" and great changes have been avoided, and instead, restoration is what was more often done, thereby preserving an impressive, unbroken ensemble of these buildings.\n\n====St. Martin====\n[[File:St. Martin, Idstein, service.jpg|thumb|Service in St. Martin, 2011]]\n{{Main|St. Martin, Idstein}}\nAs the former neogothic Catholic parish church St. Magdalena was too small for a growing population after [[World War II]], a new church St. Martin was built instead, designed by the architect [[:de:Johannes Krahn|Johannes Krahn]], resembling a [[Basilica#Christianization of the Roman basilica|Roman basilica]] with open sandstone walls and a band of windows below the ceiling, consecrated in 1964.<ref>[http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=103&type=1 St. Martin church] on the St. Martin website (in German, pictured)</ref> In 2006 a new organ was installed by [[Orgelbau Mebold]].\n\n===Limes===\n[[File:Karte limes.jpg|thumb|Map of Upper Germanic Limes]]\nThe municipal area was crossed by the [[Limes Germanicus]], a line of frontier forts begun in AD 86 by the Romans which stretched from near [[Bonn]] on the [[Rhine]] to near [[Regensburg]] on the [[Danube]]. It divided the [[Roman Empire]] from the unconquered [[Germanic tribes]]. The area of the town that stands today lay on the Germanic side. Bearing obvious witness to the Limes is a replica of a watchtower towards Niedernhausen near Dasbach on the Dasbacher H\u00f6he (heights). Even the Dasbach churchtower supposedly stands on the foundation of a Roman watchtower. Within the limits of neighbouring [[Taunusstein]] is likewise found such a replica near Orlen, right beside the remains of the [[Castra|castrum]] ''Zugmantel''.\n\nNear the outlying centre of Heftrich stood the castrum ''Alteburg'', of which, however, nothing more is to be seen.\n\nOn 15 July 2005, the Upper-Germanic-Rhaetian Limes (the Limes Germanicus) was raised to [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].\n\n===Regular events===\nAs a yearly event highlight, the ''Hessen-[[Jazz]] Festival'' or more recently ''Idstein JazzFestival'' has been drawing thousands of visitors for 20 years into the Old Town's laneways. On three days, during the first weekend in the Hesse summer holidays, up to 75 different jazz groups on a dozen stages play from Friday evening to Sunday live in an open-air concert.\n\nThe Unionskirche is the location for choral concerts of the [[Idsteiner Kantorei]] conducted by [[Carsten Koch (musician)|Carsten Koch]] twice a year, such as Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' and Bach's ''[[Christmas Oratorio (Bach)|Weihnachtsoratorium]]'' in 2009. For the annual [[European Heritage Days]] the \"Nassauische Kammerphilharmonie\" has performed a \"Sinfoniekonzert zum Tag des offenen Denkmals\", including a series of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s symphonies. The [[Rheingau Musik Festival]] staged concerts here with [[Elizabeth Parcells]], [[Chanticleer (ensemble)|Chanticleer]] and [[ensemble amarcord]], among others.\n\nIn the church [[St. Martin, Idstein|St. Martin]] an annual choral concert is performed by the combined choirs Chor St. Martin and the chamber choir Martinis, conducted by Franz Fink, such as Bach's ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' in 1998 with [[Elisabeth Scholl]], [[Andreas Scholl]] and [[Max van Egmond]] and again in 2009 with [[Andreas Pruys]] and [[Klaus Mertens]].<ref>[http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/index.php?id=512&type=1 Matth\u00e4uspassion] on the St. Martin website (in German)</ref> The concert of 2011 was Handel's ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', with soloists [[Katia Plaschka]], Andreas Scholl, [[Ulrich Cordes]] and [[Markus Flaig]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=809&type=1 |title=Mit Hingabe und Pr\u00e4zision |language=German |author=Beke Heeren-Pradt |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=21 September 2011 |publisher=Wiesbadener Tagblatt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331022114/http://www.st-martin-idstein.de/?id=809&type=1 |archive-date=31 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Other concerts in the church have included music of [[Graham Waterhouse]], the duo propram of [[Giora Feidman]] and organist [[Matthias Eisenberg]] in 2008 and a concert of [[Kalevi Kiviniemi]] in 2010.\n\nAlthough the town of Idstein hosts only a small vineyard, whose wines are not for sale but poured at special occasions, there is nonetheless a yearly wine festival, mainly presenting wines from the near [[Rheingau]].\n\nEvery other year, in the spring, the ''Idsteiner Hexenmarkt'' (Witches' Market) is held in the castle and palace area, an event with [[Middle Ages|medieval]] crafts and entertainment.\n\nIn the summer, from June to August on the third day of each of those months, the ''Alteburger Markt'' is held in Idstein-Heftrich, on the site of the Roman castrum Alteburg.\n\nThe youth centre in Idstein offers a monthly event plan with hip hop, metal, DJ night and punk rock, offering at irregular intervals, for instance live concerts by local bands.\n\nSince 2003, the \"Monkey Jump Festival\" has been held annually. A great number of bands perform in the town's various pubs and restaurants during the festival.\n\nSince 2004, the Idstein [[International Women's Day|Women's Day]] ''Frauen in Balance'' (\"Women in Balance\") has been held annually at the ''Gerberhaus'', in collaboration with the Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis equality commissioner.\n\n==Famous people==\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n[[File:Wenck, Friedrich August Wilhelm.jpg|thumb|150px|Friedrich August Wilhelm Wenck (1810)]]\n*[[Henriette Charlotte of Nassau-Idstein]] (1693\u20131734), consort of [[Maurice Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg]]\n* Henriette Maria Luise von Hayn (1722\u20131782), poet\n* [[Johann Andreas Benignus Bergstr\u00e4sser]] (1732-1812), entomologist and Rector of the University of Hanover\n* [[Helfrich Bernhard Wenck]] (1739\u20131803), historian and educator \n* [[Friedrich August Wilhelm Wenck]] (1741\u20131810), historian\n* Wilhelm Snell (1789\u20131851), professor of jurisprudence and politician in Switzerland\n* Wilhelm August Kobb\u00e9 (1802\u20131881), diplomat\n* Marx L\u00f6wenstein (1824\u20131889), German-American multimillionaire\n* [[Karl Hill]] (1831\u20131893), operatic baritone, who created Klingsor in ''[[Parsifal]]'' in [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]]\n* Carl Jakob Frankenbach (1861\u20131937), painter and illustrator\n* Ferdinand Abt (1877\u20131962), sculptor\n* Walther Schultze (1893\u20131970), dermatologist\n* Klaus-Peter Sattler (born 1941), composer\n* Gerhard Krum (born 1947), politician\n* Patrick van Hecke, alias Dirrrty Franz, namesake of the German [[crunk]] group [[:de:Dirrrty Franz & die b-Side Boyz|Dirrrty Franz & die B-Side Boyz]]\n* Stefanie Werner (born 1970), renowned architect in New York\n\n===People connected with Idstein===\n[[File:William August Kobb\u00e9.JPG|thumb|150px|William August Kobb\u00e9 (1900)]]\n* [[Arnold I, Count of Laurenburg]] (died ''c.'' 1148), was from 1124 [[Vogt]] of Idstein.\n* [[Adolf, King of Germany|Adolf of Nassau]] (''c.'' 1255\u20131298), used Idstein Castle as one of his two main residences before 1292, when he became [[King of the Romans]]\n* [[Imagina of Isenburg-Limburg]] (''c.'' 1255\u20131313), was the consort of Adolf of Nassau\n* [[Sebastian Stoskopff]] (1597\u20131657), Alsatian painter, lived and died in Idstein\n* [[Karl Christian von Langsdorf]], mathematician, geologist, and engineer, attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Idstein\n* Johann Baptist Friedrich Anton von Franqu\u00e9 (1796\u20131865), physician\n* [[William August Kobb\u00e9]] (1840\u20131931), U.S. Army general, was the son of Wilhelm Kobb\u00e9, born in Idstein \n* [[Gustav Kobb\u00e9]] (1857\u20131918), American author of ''[[The Complete Opera Book]]'', was another son of Wilhelm Kobb\u00e9\n* [[Ernst Toepfer]] (1877\u20131955), painter, lived for parts of his life in Idstein and died there\n* Wolf Meyer-Erlach (1891\u20131982), theologian, college teacher, university rector; 1951\u20131963 parish administrator in Idstein-W\u00f6rsdorf\n* Karlhans Krohn (1908\u20132003), sport teacher; popularizer of the game [[peteca]], spent his later years in Idstein\n* Wilhelm Fresenius (1913\u20132004), chemist and industrialist\n* [[Werner Schuster (politician)|Werner Schuster]] (1939\u20132001), physician, [[health informatics]] specialist and politician\n* [[Christiane Kohl]], soprano, grew up in Idstein\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n* [[Hermann M\u00fcller (Idstein)|Hermann M\u00fcller]] (1935\u20132013), former mayor of Idstein\n* [[Erivan Haub]] (born 1932), owner of the [[Tengelmann Group]], lived for some years in Idstein. nominated 2008\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Official website}} {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.nassau-info.de/geschichte-hexenverfolgung.htm Persecution of witches in Idstein] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.ev-kirche-idstein.de/ Unionskirche website] {{in lang|de}}\n*{{curlie|World/Deutsch/Regional/Europa/Deutschland/Hessen/Landkreise/Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis/St\u00e4dte_und_Gemeinden/Idstein|Idstein}} {{in lang|de}}\n{{Towns and municipalities in Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis district}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rheingau-Taunus-Kreis]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idstein"}

The film follows a hotel manager ensnared in an [[assassination]] plot by a [[Terrorism|terrorist]] while aboard a [[red-eye flight]] to [[Miami]]. The [[film score]] was composed and conducted by [[Marco Beltrami]]. It was distributed by [[DreamWorks Pictures]] and was released on August 19, 2005. The film received positive reviews from critics and fans of Craven's work and was a box office success. An extended version of the film, which added previously unused footage to increase the running time, was broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network several times.\n\n==Plot==\nHotel manager Lisa Reisert ([[Rachel McAdams]]) arrives at [[Dallas Love Field]] to take a [[red-eye flight]] back to [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. She meets a handsome young man named Jackson Rippner ([[Cillian Murphy]]), also traveling to Miami. While waiting to board, they share a drink at the airport bar and engage in small talk. \n\nLisa is surprised to find that Jackson is seated beside her. After takeoff, Jackson's charming demeanor quickly turns sinister as he informs Lisa that he works for a [[domestic terrorist]] organization planning to assassinate Charles Keefe ([[Jack Scalia]]), the current [[United States Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security]]. Lisa's managerial position at the Lux Atlantic Hotel in Miami, where Keefe and his family are staying, is crucial to their plot. As Acting Manager, Lisa must make a call from the [[in-flight phone]] to order the Keefe family be moved to a targeted room where a missile launched from a boat in the harbor will strike. Her non-compliance will result in Jackson's [[hitman]] accomplice killing Lisa's father, Joe ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]).\n\nWhile Jackson is distracted, Lisa writes a warning inside the self-help book she had previously given away to a friendly fellow-passenger ([[Angela Paton]]). Jackson head-butts Lisa unconscious and retrieves the book before the woman reads the message. She revives half an hour later and is forced to make the call to the hotel. When a storm disrupts the sky phone service mid-conversation with her co-worker, Cynthia ([[Jayma Mays]]), Lisa pretends to be ordering the room change until Jackson catches on. She then persuades Jackson to let her use the restroom while the phone service is still disrupted. Lisa writes a fake bomb threat in soap on the mirror; Jackson, checking on her, sees it and angrily wipes it off, then roughs her up in the restroom. A young girl waiting outside becomes suspicious and tells the flight attendant that Jackson is inside with Lisa, but it is dismissed as a sexual escapade. \n\nWhen the sky phones are operational again, Lisa calls Cynthia and has her move the Keefe family to the targeted suite. She then pleads with Jackson to call off the accomplice waiting outside her father's house, but he refuses until the assassination is confirmed.\n\nAs the plane lands at [[Miami International Airport]], Lisa reveals that the knife scar Jackson noticed on her upper chest was due to a violent rape at knife point two years earlier and which she swore would never happen again. She then stabs Jackson in the throat with a [[ballpoint pen]], grabs his phone, and flees the plane and terminal. Once outside, Lisa steals an unattended SUV. She calls Cynthia, telling her to evacuate the hotel and warn the Keefes. Cynthia, the Keefes, and [[U.S. Secret Service]] agents escape seconds before a [[FGM-148 Javelin|Javelin missile]] hits the room.\n\nThe cell phone's battery dies as Lisa is calling her father. Arriving at his house and seeing the assassin at the front door, she hits and kills him with the car when he shoots at her with a [[suppressor|suppressed]] pistol. Lisa's father is unharmed and has called 9-1-1. Lisa calls Cynthia, unaware Jackson arrived and incapacitated her father. Jackson pursues Lisa throughout the house. As they struggle, he throws her down the staircase. Lisa, stunned, retrieves the dead hitman's gun and shoots Jackson. Wounded, he disarms Lisa and is about to kill her when a revived Joe shoots Jackson with the gun. Lisa returns to the hotel to provide assistance where Keefe praises both women for their actions.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rachel McAdams]] as Lisa Reisert\n* [[Cillian Murphy]] as Jackson Rippner\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Joe Reisert\n* [[Jayma Mays]] as Cynthia\n* [[Jack Scalia]] as Charles Keefe\n* [[Robert Pine (actor)|Robert Pine]] as Bob Taylor\n* Teresa Press-Marx as Marianne Taylor\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Nice Lady\n* [[Suzie Plakson]] as Senior Flight Attendant\n* Monica McSwain as Junior Flight Attendant\n* [[Laura Johnson]] as Blonde Woman\n* [[Loren Lester]] as Doctor\n* [[Max Kasch]] as Headphone Kid\n* [[Kyle Gallner]] as Headphone Kid's Brother\n* Brittany Oaks as Rebecca\n* [[Beth Toussaint]] as Lydia Keefe\n* [[Colby Donaldson]] as Keefe's Head Bodyguard\n* [[Marc Macaulay]] as Coast Guard Officer\n* [[Jenny Wade]] as Coffee Shop Girl\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Red Eye'' opened theatrically on August 19, 2005, in 3,079 venues, earning $16,167,662 in its opening weekend, ranking second in the domestic box office behind ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'' ($21,422,815).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2005&wknd=33&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for August 19-21, 2005 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=August 22, 2005 | accessdate=November 26, 2015}}</ref> At the end of its run, eight weeks later (on October 13), the film grossed $57,891,803 in the United States and Canada, and $37,685,971 overseas for a worldwide total of $95,577,774.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]].

Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\").<ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion \u2013 from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] \u2013 during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as \"[[acts of reparation]]\" for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These \"[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|acts of reparation to Jesus Christ]]\" do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{See also|Life of Christ in art}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nEach episode of the Passion, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]], that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, or with the addition of a 15th, the resurrection. Since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or [[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. Ninth-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscripts begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba|''turba'']] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one person speaks simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n*''Summa Passionis'' settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"''summa Passionis''\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"''exordium''\" (introduction) and \"''conclusio''\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a Passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]) and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant: see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section.

The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels.

It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

[[Luke 22:43\u201344]] adds that Jesus was terrified, and sweat blood; however, the oldest manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke do not contain these two verses, the other three canonical gospels don't mention this event either, and various manuscripts contain these verses elsewhere, even in the Gospel of Matthew (suggesting repeated attempts at insertion); thus, most modern scholars consider this tradition a later [[Christian interpolation]], probably to counter [[docetism]].<ref name=Aland>{{Cite book |last=Aland |first= Kurt |authorlink=Kurt Aland |last2=Aland |first2=Barbara |authorlink2=Barbara Aland |others=Erroll F.

Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\").<ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion \u2013 from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] \u2013 during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as \"[[acts of reparation]]\" for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These \"[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|acts of reparation to Jesus Christ]]\" do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{See also|Life of Christ in art}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nEach episode of the Passion, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels.

It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150.

The current campus is now located beside Parco Ravizza, between Via Sarfatti and Viale Bligny and consists of several buildings, all within walking distance to [[Porta Ticinese]], the [[Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio]]:\n*The first building in Via Sarfatti was designed in 1936 by the Italian [[architect]] [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. It contains classrooms, an aula magna, a [[restaurant]], and most of the administrative [[office]]s. Its entrance features two [[lion]] statues which are the subject of several university [[myth]]s.\n*The ''pensionato'' building, which faces Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was inaugurated in 1956 by architect Giovanni Muzio and hosts some grand halls, some of the [[Canteen (place)|canteen]] and [[dormitory]] facilities (350 bedrooms on 5 floors), and some faculty offices. The different floors have an irregular form and bear the shape of a symmetric \"L\" letter, which stands for Laude.\n*The [[SDA Bocconi]] building, which is also in Via Ferdinando Bocconi, was opened in 1985 and features two blocks with a distinct set of dark metal panels. The building was extended in 2001, especially to host EGEA, the university bookstore. The campus [[Association football pitch|football pitch]] is placed between the ''pensionato'' and the [[SDA Bocconi]] building.\n*The modern ''Velodromo'' building was projected by [[Ignazio Gardella]] and opened in 2001. It is called so due to its form resembling an [[ellipsoid]] [[velodrome]]. Each of its four floors has about ten classrooms with a capacity of 150. The ''Velodromo'' uses a [[geothermal exchange heat pump]] as its [[air conditioning]] system, which provides [[energy conservation]].<ref>[http://www.turismo.comune.milano.it/pls/milano/!turismo?pid=21504&_first=8 Milano per Me - Itinerari - Conoscere Milano - Ravizza<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A [[marble]] statue of Ferdinando Bocconi overlooks the foyer of the ground floor.\n*Close by, in Piazza Sraffa, are the [[Library]] building (also built by Giovanni Muzio in 1962), the campus [[chapel]] ''\"San Ferdinando\"'', and some smaller buildings such as those with the offices of the Language Center and other [[extracurricular]] activities.\n*In 2007, a new building was inaugurated in Via Guglielm\u00f6 R\u00f6ntgen known as Grafton Building from the name of the Irish practice [[Grafton Architects]] which designed the innovative building.
