Dental composite resins have certain properties that will benefit patients according to the patient's cavity. It has a micro-mechanical retention property that makes composite more effective for filling small cavities where amalgam fillings are not as effective and could therefore fall out (due to the macro-mechanical retention property of amalgam). Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of [[Bis-GMA]] and other dimethacrylate [[monomer]]s (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as [[silica]] and in most current applications, a [[photoinitiator]]. [[Dimethylglyoxime]] is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann|title=Dental Materials|authors=Robert G.

Depending on the skill of the dentist, patient characteristics and the type and location of damage, composite restorations can have similar longevity to amalgam restorations. (See [[Dental composite#Longevity and clinical performance|Longevity and clinical performance]].) In comparison to amalgam, the appearance of resin-based composite restorations is far superior.\n\n==History of use==\nTraditionally resin-based composites set by a chemical setting reaction through [[polymerization]] between two pastes.

Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than [[silicate]]s and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with [[polishing]], difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Microfilled Period'''\n\nIn 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market.<ref name=\":3\" /> These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most [[Dental restoration|restorations]] provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Hybrid Period'''\n\nHybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as [[Glass ionomer cement|resin-modified glass ionomer cements]] (RMGICs).<ref name=\":0\" /> The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule.<ref name=\":0\" /> The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for [[Tooth decay|Class II cavities]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials|last=Vanherle|first=Guido|last2=Smith|first2=Dennis C|publisher=Peter Szule Publishing Co.|year=1985|isbn=|location=The Netherlands|pages=28\u201329|quote=}}</ref> RMGICs can be used instead.

In the 1990s and 2000s, such composites were greatly improved and have a compression strength sufficient for use in posterior [[Tooth|teeth]].\n[[image:MethmethacrylateBPA-glyc.png|thumb|left|334px|Chemical structure of [[bis-GMA]] (bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate), bearing two polymerizable groups, it is prone to form a crosslinked polymer that is used in dental restorations.<ref name=Ull/>]]\n\n==Method and clinical application==\nToday's composite resins have low polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which allows them to be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely.  The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth.  Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rueggeberg|first1=Frederick|title=State-of-the-art: Dental Photocuring - A review|journal=Dental Materials|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2010.10.021|pmid=21122903}}</ref>), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see [[Light activated resin]]).  It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2\u20133&nbsp;mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2\u20133&nbsp;mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kubo|first=Shisei|date=2011-02-01|title=Longevity of resin composite restorations|journal=Japanese Dental Science Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=43\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.jdsr.2010.05.002|issn=1882-7616}}</ref>\n\nThe most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by [[aluminum oxide]] disks. Classically, [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class III]] composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized.  Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \"sandwiched\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s.  The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% [[phosphoric acid]] and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-[[eugenol]]. Composite resins for [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class II]] restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations.  Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. | title = Is it the end of the road for dental amalgam?

Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler [[glasses]] and [[glass ceramics]]. The [[filler (materials)|filler]] gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=Bonsor|first=Steven|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref> Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material. Ceramic fillers include zirconia-silica and zirconium oxide.\n\nMatrices such as BisHPPP and BBP, contained in the universal adhesive BiSGMA, have been demonstrated to increase the cariogenicity of bacteria leading to the occurrence of secondary caries at the composite-dentin interface. BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of [[glycosyltransferase]] in S. mutans bacteria,  which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials.  BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sadeghinejad|first=Lida|last2=Cvitkovitch|first2=Dennis G|last3=Siqueira|first3=Walter L.|last4=Merritt|first4=Justin|last5=Santerre|first5=J Paul|last6=Finer|first6=Yoav|date=2017-02-01|title=Mechanistic, Genomic and Proteomic Study on the Effects of BisGMA-derived Biodegradation Product on Cariogenic Bacteria|journal=Dental Materials |volume=33|issue=2|pages=175\u2013190|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2016.11.007|pmc=5253116|pmid=27919444}}</ref>\n\nA coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: [[camphorquinone]] (CQ), [[phenylpropanedione]] (PPD) or [[lucirin]] (TPO)) begins the [[polymerization]] reaction of the resins when blue light is applied. Various additives can control the rate of reaction.\n\n=== Filler types and particle size ===\nResin filler can be made of glasses or ceramics. Glass fillers are usually made of crystalline silica, silicone dioxide, lithium/barium-aluminium glass, and borosilicate glass containing zinc/strontium/lithium. Ceramic fillers are made of zirconia-silica, or zirconium oxide.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials|last=J.|first=Bonsor, Stephen|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|others=Pearson, Gavin J.|isbn=9780702031588|location=Amsterdam|pages=73\u201375|oclc=824491168}}</ref>\n\nFillers can be further subdivided based on their particle size and shapes such as:\n\n==== Macrofilled filler ====\nMacrofilled fillers have a particle size ranging from 5 - 10&nbsp;\u00b5m. They have good mechanical strength but poor wear resistance. Final restoration is difficult to polish adequately leaving rough surfaces, and therefore this type of resin is plaque retentive.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Microfilled filler ====\nMicrofilled fillers are made of colloidal silica with a particle size of 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m. Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Hybrid filler ====\nHybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Nanofilled filler ====\nNanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70&nbsp;nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Bulk filler ====\nBulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material.&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=J.|last2=Jowett|first2=A.|last3=Gallacher|first3=A.|last4=Nixon|first4=P.|title=Bulk-fill resin-based composite restorative materials: a review|journal=BDJ|language=en|volume=222|issue=5|pages=337\u2013344|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.214|pmid=28281590|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nAdvantages of composites:\n\n* Appearance: The main advantage of a direct dental composite over traditional materials such as [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] is improved tooth tissue-mimicry. Composites can be in a wide range of tooth colors allowing near invisible restoration of teeth. Composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior teeth region - see [[Aesthetic anterior composite restoration|Aesthetic anterior composite restorations]].\n* Bonding to tooth structure: Composite fillings micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens the tooth's structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth to allow a micro-mechanical bond to the tooth allows good adhesion of the restoration to the tooth. Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with the current generation of dentin bonding agents. \n* Tooth-sparing preparation: The fact that composite fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, there is no need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or \"box\") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration. \n* Less-costly and more conservative alternative to [[dental crown]]s: In some situations, a composite restoration may be offered as a less-expensive (though possibly less durable) alternative to a dental crown, which can be a very expensive treatment. Installation of a dental crown usually requires removal of significant healthy tooth material so the crown can fit over or into the natural tooth. Composite restoration conserves more of the natural tooth.\n*Alternative to tooth removal: As a composite restoration bonds to the tooth and can restore the original physical integrity of a damaged or decayed tooth, in some cases composite restoration can preserve a tooth that might not be salvageable with amalgam restoration. For example, depending on the location and extent of decay, it might not be possible to create a void (a \"box\") of the geometry necessary to retain an amalgam filling.\n* Versatility: Composite fillings can be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Dental Health and Tooth Fillings|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-fillings?page=2|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> which would not be repairable using amalgam fillings.\n* Repairability: In many cases of minor damage to a composite filling, the damage can be easily repaired by adding additional composite. An amalgam filling might require complete replacement.\n*Longer working time: The light-curing composite allows the on-demand setting and longer working time to some degree for the operator compared to amalgam restoration.\n* Reduced quantity of mercury released to the environment: Composites avoid mercury environmental contamination associated with dentistry. When amalgam fillings are drilled for height adjustment, repair or replacement, some mercury-containing amalgam is inevitably washed down drains. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Environmental impact|Dental amalgam controversy - Environmental impact]]) When amalgam fillings are prepared by dentists, improperly disposed excess material may enter landfills or be incinerated. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam fillings releases mercury into the environment. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Cremation|Dental amalgam controversy - Cremation]])\n* Reduced mercury exposure for dentists: Preparing new amalgam fillings and drilling into existing amalgam fillings exposes dentists to mercury vapor. Use of composite fillings avoids this risk, unless the procedure also involves removing an existing amalgam filling. A review article found studies indicating that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rklund1991\">{{cite journal |author=Bj\u00f8rklund G |title=Mercury in the dental office.

Some dental insurance plans may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds.

Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held [[Dental Curing Light|curing light]] that emits specific [[wavelength]]s keyed to the [[Radical initiator|initiator]] and [[catalyst]] packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble [[porosity]].\n\nDirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling cavity preparations\n* Filling gaps ([[Diastema (dentistry)|diastemas]]) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Minor reshaping of teeth\n* Partial crowns on single teeth\n\n=== Setting mechanisms of resin composite ===\nTypes of setting mechanisms:\n* Chemical cure (self-cure / dark cure)\n* Light cure\n* Dual cure (setting both chemically and by light)\nChemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together.\n\nLight cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl-methacrylate (amine) or diketone.They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500&nbsp;nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum.  The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light.\n\nDual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing.\n\nChemical [[polymerisation inhibitor]]s (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.\n\n=== Classification of resin composites according to handling characteristics ===\nThis classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics:\n* Universal: advocated for general use, oldest subtype of resin composite\n* Flowable: fluid consistency, used for very small restorations\n* Packable: stiffer, more viscous material used solely for posterior parts of the mouth\n\nManufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading.\n\n'''Universal:'''\nThis is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching.\n[[File:Flowable composite.jpg|thumb|263x263px|The use of flowable composite in early decay of lower molar teeth.]]\n'''Flowable:'''\nFlowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin-based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37\u201353%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable.\n\n'''Packable:'''\nPackable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) \u2013 thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite.\n\n==Indirect dental composites==\n\nIndirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way.\nAs a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps<ref name=\"ElevenYearEvaluation\">Composite resin fillings and inlays.

For example, an entire crown can be cured in a single process cycle in an extra-oral curing unit, compared to a millimeter layer of a filling.\n\nAs a result, full crowns and even bridges (replacing multiple teeth) can be fabricated with these systems.\n\nIndirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling [[Dental caries|cavities]] in teeth, as fillings, [[Inlays and onlays|inlays and/or onlays]]\n* Filling gaps (diastemas) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Reshaping of teeth\n* Full or partial [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]]s on single teeth\n* Bridges spanning 2-3 teeth\n\nA stronger, tougher and more durable product is expected in principle.

Dental composite resins have certain properties that will benefit patients according to the patient's cavity. It has a micro-mechanical retention property that makes composite more effective for filling small cavities where amalgam fillings are not as effective and could therefore fall out (due to the macro-mechanical retention property of amalgam). Synthetic resins evolved as restorative materials since they were insoluble, of good tooth-like appearance, insensitive to dehydration, easy to manipulate and reasonably inexpensive. Composite resins are most commonly composed of [[Bis-GMA]] and other dimethacrylate [[monomer]]s (TEGMA, UDMA, HDDMA), a filler material such as [[silica]] and in most current applications, a [[photoinitiator]]. [[Dimethylglyoxime]] is also commonly added to achieve certain physical properties such as flow-ability. Further tailoring of physical properties is achieved by formulating unique concentrations of each constituent.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann|title=Dental Materials|authors=Robert G.

(See [[Dental composite#Longevity and clinical performance|Longevity and clinical performance]].)

Composite resins displayed superior qualities, in that they had better mechanical properties than [[silicate]]s and unfulfilled resins. Composite resins were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with composite resins at this time were that they had poor appearance, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with [[polishing]], difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Microfilled Period'''\n\nIn 1978, various microfilled systems were introduced into the European market.<ref name=\":3\" /> These composite resins were appealing, in that they were capable of having an extremely smooth surface when finished. These microfilled composite resins also showed a better clinical colour stability and higher resistance to wear than conventional composites, which favoured their tooth tissue-like appearance as well as clinical effectiveness. However, further research showed a progressive weakness in the material over time, leading to micro-cracks and step-like material loss around the composite margin. In 1981, microfilled composites were improved remarkably with regard to marginal retention and adaptation. It was decided, after further research, that this type of composite could be used for most [[Dental restoration|restorations]] provided the acid etch technique was used and a bonding agent was applied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''The Hybrid Period'''\n\nHybrid composites were introduced in the 1980s and are more commonly known as [[Glass ionomer cement|resin-modified glass ionomer cements]] (RMGICs).<ref name=\":0\" /> The material consists of a powder containing a radio-opaque fluoroaluminosilicate glass and a photoactive liquid contained in a dark bottle or capsule.<ref name=\":0\" /> The material was introduced, as resin composites on their own were not suitable for [[Tooth decay|Class II cavities]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Posterior Composite Resin Dental Restorative Materials|last=Vanherle|first=Guido|last2=Smith|first2=Dennis C|publisher=Peter Szule Publishing Co.|year=1985|isbn=|location=The Netherlands|pages=28\u201329|quote=}}</ref> RMGICs can be used instead.

The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely.  The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth.  Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470&nbsp;nm<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rueggeberg|first1=Frederick|title=State-of-the-art: Dental Photocuring - A review|journal=Dental Materials|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=39\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2010.10.021|pmid=21122903}}</ref>), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see [[Light activated resin]]).  It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2\u20133&nbsp;mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2\u20133&nbsp;mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, of good appearance, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kubo|first=Shisei|date=2011-02-01|title=Longevity of resin composite restorations|journal=Japanese Dental Science Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=43\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.jdsr.2010.05.002|issn=1882-7616}}</ref>\n\nThe most desirable finish surface for a composite resin can be provided by [[aluminum oxide]] disks. Classically, [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class III]] composite preparations were required to have retention points placed entirely in dentin. A syringe was used for placing composite resin because the possibility of trapping air in a restoration was minimized.  Modern techniques vary, but conventional wisdom states that because there have been great increases in bonding strength due to the use of dentin primers in the late 1990s, physical retention is not needed except for the most extreme of cases. Primers allow the dentin's collagen fibers to be \"sandwiched\" into the resin, resulting in a superior physical and chemical bond of the filling to the tooth. Indeed, composite usage was highly controversial in the dental field until primer technology was standardized in the mid to late 1990s.  The enamel margin of a composite resin preparation should be beveled in order to improve the appearance and expose the ends of the enamel rods for acid attack. The correct technique of enamel etching prior to placement of a composite resin restoration includes etching with 30%-50% [[phosphoric acid]] and rinsing thoroughly with water and drying with air only. In preparing a cavity for restoration with composite resin combined with an acid etch technique, all enamel cavosurface angles should be obtuse angles. Contraindications for composite include varnish and zinc oxide-[[eugenol]]. Composite resins for [[Dental restoration#Restoration classifications|Class II]] restorations were not indicated because of excessive occlusal wear in the 1980s and early 1990s. Modern bonding techniques and the increasing unpopularity of amalgam filling material have made composites more attractive for Class II restorations.  Opinions vary, but composite is regarded as having adequate longevity and wear characteristics to be used for permanent Class II restorations. Whether composite materials last as long or has the leakage and sensitivity properties when compared to Class II amalgam restorations was described as a matter of debate in 2008.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. | title = Is it the end of the road for dental amalgam?

Without a filler the resin wears easily, exhibits high shrinkage and is exothermic. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler [[glasses]] and [[glass ceramics]]. The [[filler (materials)|filler]] gives the composite greater strength, wear resistance, decreased polymerisation shrinkage, improved translucency, fluorescence and colour, and a reduced exothermic reaction on polymerisation. It also however causes the resin composite to become more brittle with an increased elastic modulus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=Bonsor|first=Steven|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=71}}</ref> Glass fillers are found in multiple different compositions allowing an improvement on the optical and mechanical properties of the material.

BisHPPP and BBP cause an increase of [[glycosyltransferase]] in S. mutans bacteria,  which results in increased production of sticky glucans that allow S.mutans' adherence to the tooth. This results in a cariogenic biofilms at the interface of composite and tooth. The cariogenic activity of bacteria increases with concentration of the matrix materials.  BisHPPP has furthermore been shown to regulate bacterial genes, making bacteria more cariogenic, thus compromising the longevity of composite restorations. Researchers are highlighting the need for new composite materials to be developed which eliminate the cariogenic products currently contained in composite resin and universal adhesives.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sadeghinejad|first=Lida|last2=Cvitkovitch|first2=Dennis G|last3=Siqueira|first3=Walter L.|last4=Merritt|first4=Justin|last5=Santerre|first5=J Paul|last6=Finer|first6=Yoav|date=2017-02-01|title=Mechanistic, Genomic and Proteomic Study on the Effects of BisGMA-derived Biodegradation Product on Cariogenic Bacteria|journal=Dental Materials |volume=33|issue=2|pages=175\u2013190|doi=10.1016/j.dental.2016.11.007|pmc=5253116|pmid=27919444}}</ref>\n\nA coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between these two components.

Resin with this type of filler is easier to polish compared to macrofilled. However, its mechanical properties are compromised as filler load is lower than in conventional (only 40-45% by weight). Therefore, it is contraindicated for load-bearing situations, and has poor wear resistance.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Hybrid filler ====\nHybrid filler contains particles of various sizes with filler load of 75-85% by weight. It was designed to get the benefits of both macrofilled and microfilled fillers. Resins with hybrid filler have reduced thermal expansion and higher mechanical strength. However, it has higher polymerisation shrinkage due to a larger volume of diluent monomer which controls viscosity of resin.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Nanofilled filler ====\nNanofilled composite has a filler particle size of 20-70&nbsp;nm. Nanoparticles form nanocluster units and act as a single unit. They have high mechanical strength similar to hybrid material, high wear resistance, and are easily polished. However, nanofilled resins are difficult to adapt to the cavity margins due to high volume of filler.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Bulk filler ====\nBulk filler is composed of non-agglomerated silica and zirconia particles. It has nanohybrid particles and filler load of 77% by weight. Designed to decrease clinical steps with possibility of light curing through 4-5mm incremental depth, and reduce stress within remaining tooth tissue. Unfortunately, it is not as strong in compression and has decreased wear resistance compared to conventional material.&nbsp;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chesterman|first=J.|last2=Jowett|first2=A.|last3=Gallacher|first3=A.|last4=Nixon|first4=P.|title=Bulk-fill resin-based composite restorative materials: a review|journal=BDJ|language=en|volume=222|issue=5|pages=337\u2013344|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2017.214|pmid=28281590|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Advantages==\nAdvantages of composites:\n\n* Appearance: The main advantage of a direct dental composite over traditional materials such as [[amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]] is improved tooth tissue-mimicry. Composites can be in a wide range of tooth colors allowing near invisible restoration of teeth. Composite fillings can be closely matched to the color of existing teeth. Aesthetics are especially critical in anterior teeth region - see [[Aesthetic anterior composite restoration|Aesthetic anterior composite restorations]].\n* Bonding to tooth structure: Composite fillings micro-mechanically bond to tooth structure. This strengthens the tooth's structure and restores its original physical integrity. The discovery of acid etching (producing enamel irregularities ranging from 5-30 micrometers in depth) of teeth to allow a micro-mechanical bond to the tooth allows good adhesion of the restoration to the tooth. Very high bond strengths to tooth structure, both enamel and dentin, can be achieved with the current generation of dentin bonding agents. \n* Tooth-sparing preparation: The fact that composite fillings are glued (bonded) to the tooth means that unlike amalgam fillings, there is no need for the dentist to create retentive features destroying healthy tooth. Unlike amalgam, which just fills a hole and relies on the geometry of the hole to retain the filling, composite materials are bonded to the tooth. In order to achieve the necessary geometry to retain an amalgam filling, the dentist may need to drill out a significant amount of healthy tooth material. In the case of a composite restoration, the geometry of the hole (or \"box\") is less important because a composite filling bonds to the tooth. Therefore less healthy tooth needs to be removed for a composite restoration. \n* Less-costly and more conservative alternative to [[dental crown]]s: In some situations, a composite restoration may be offered as a less-expensive (though possibly less durable) alternative to a dental crown, which can be a very expensive treatment. Installation of a dental crown usually requires removal of significant healthy tooth material so the crown can fit over or into the natural tooth. Composite restoration conserves more of the natural tooth.\n*Alternative to tooth removal: As a composite restoration bonds to the tooth and can restore the original physical integrity of a damaged or decayed tooth, in some cases composite restoration can preserve a tooth that might not be salvageable with amalgam restoration. For example, depending on the location and extent of decay, it might not be possible to create a void (a \"box\") of the geometry necessary to retain an amalgam filling.\n* Versatility: Composite fillings can be used to repair chipped, broken or worn teeth<ref name=WebMD>{{cite web|title=Dental Health and Tooth Fillings|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-fillings?page=2|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=23 November 2013}}</ref> which would not be repairable using amalgam fillings.\n* Repairability: In many cases of minor damage to a composite filling, the damage can be easily repaired by adding additional composite. An amalgam filling might require complete replacement.\n*Longer working time: The light-curing composite allows the on-demand setting and longer working time to some degree for the operator compared to amalgam restoration.\n* Reduced quantity of mercury released to the environment: Composites avoid mercury environmental contamination associated with dentistry. When amalgam fillings are drilled for height adjustment, repair or replacement, some mercury-containing amalgam is inevitably washed down drains. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Environmental impact|Dental amalgam controversy - Environmental impact]]) When amalgam fillings are prepared by dentists, improperly disposed excess material may enter landfills or be incinerated. Cremation of bodies containing amalgam fillings releases mercury into the environment. (See [[Dental amalgam controversy#Cremation|Dental amalgam controversy - Cremation]])\n* Reduced mercury exposure for dentists: Preparing new amalgam fillings and drilling into existing amalgam fillings exposes dentists to mercury vapor. Use of composite fillings avoids this risk, unless the procedure also involves removing an existing amalgam filling. A review article found studies indicating that dental work involving mercury may be an occupational hazard with respect to reproductive processes, glioblastoma (brain cancer), renal function changes, allergies and immunotoxicological effects.<ref name=\"Bj\u00f8rklund1991\">{{cite journal |author=Bj\u00f8rklund G |title=Mercury in the dental office.

Most current microhybrid and nanohybrid composites have a polymerization shrinkage that ranges from 2% to 3.5%. Composite shrinkage can be reduced by altering the molecular and bulk composition of the resin.<ref>For example, ''UltraSeal XT Plus'' uses Bis-GMA without dimethacrylate and was found to have a shrinkage of 5.63%, 30 minutes after curing.  On the other hand, this same study found that ''Heliomolar'', which uses Bis-GMA, UDMA and decandiol dimethacrylate, had a shrinkage of 2.00%, 30 minutes after curing.{{cite journal|title= Polymerization shrinkage and contraction stress of dental resin composites|journal=Dental Materials|year=2005|first=CJ|last= KLEVERLAAN|volume=21|issue=12|pages=1150\u20137|doi= 10.1016/j.dental.2005.02.004|url=|pmid= 16040118|last2= Feilzer|first2= AJ }} Retrieved 2009-04-16.</ref> In the field of dental restorative materials, reduction of composite shrinkage has been achieved with some success.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\" /> Among the newest materials, silorane resin exhibits lower polymerization shrinkage, compared to the dimethacrylates.<ref name=\"DOI10.4103/0972-0707.45247\"/>\n* Durability: In some situations, composite fillings may not last as long as amalgam fillings under the pressure of chewing, particularly if used for large cavities.

Due to the longer time involved, the fee charged by a dentist for a composite restoration may be higher than for an amalgam restoration.<ref name=\"WebMD\"/> \n*Costs: Composite restoration cases generally have limited insurance coverage. Some dental insurance plans may provide reimbursement for composite restoration only on front teeth where amalgam restorations would be particularly objectionable on cosmetic grounds. Thus, patients may be required to pay the entire charge for composite restorations on posterior teeth. For example one dental insurer states that most of their plans will pay for resin (i.e. composite) fillings only \"on the teeth where their cosmetic benefit is critical: the six front teeth (incisors and cuspids) and on the facial (cheek side) surfaces of the next two teeth (bicuspids).\"<ref name=\"Delta Dental\"/> Even if charges are paid by private insurance or government programs, the higher cost is incorporated in dental insurance premiums or tax rates. In the UK, dental composites are not covered by NHS for the restoration of posterior teeth. Patients, therefore, may require to pay the entire charge of the treatment or have to pay according to the private charge rate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/dentists/whats-available-on-the-nhs/|title=What's available on the NHS?|date=2018-08-02|website=nhs.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Direct dental composites==\n[[File:Polymerisationslampe an 20090930 03.JPG|thumb|right|A hand-held wand that emits primary blue light (\u03bbmax=450-470nm) is used to cure the resin within a dental patient's mouth.]]Direct dental composites are placed by the dentist in a clinical setting. Polymerization is accomplished typically with a hand held [[Dental Curing Light|curing light]] that emits specific [[wavelength]]s keyed to the [[Radical initiator|initiator]] and [[catalyst]] packages involved. When using a curing light, the light should be held as close to the resin surface as possible, a shield should be placed between the light tip and the operator's eyes. Curing time should be increased for darker resin shades. Light cured resins provide denser restoration than self-cured resins because no mixing is required that might introduce air bubble [[porosity]].\n\nDirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling cavity preparations\n* Filling gaps ([[Diastema (dentistry)|diastemas]]) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Minor reshaping of teeth\n* Partial crowns on single teeth\n\n=== Setting mechanisms of resin composite ===\nTypes of setting mechanisms:\n* Chemical cure (self-cure / dark cure)\n* Light cure\n* Dual cure (setting both chemically and by light)\nChemically cured resin composite is a two-paste system (base and catalyst) which starts to set when the base and the catalyst are mixed together.\n\nLight cured resin composites contains a photo-initiator (e.g. camphorquinone) and an accelerator. The activator present in light activated composite is diethyl-amino-ethyl-methacrylate (amine) or diketone.They interact when exposed to light at wavelength of 400-500&nbsp;nm, i.e, blue region of the visible light spectrum.  The composite sets when it is exposed to light energy at a set wavelength of light. Light cured resin composites are also sensitive to ambient light, and therefore, polymerisation can begin before use of the curing light.\n\nDual cured resin composite contains both photo-initiators and chemical accelerators, allowing the material to set even where there is insufficient light exposure for light curing.\n\nChemical [[polymerisation inhibitor]]s (e.g. monomethyl ether of hydroquinone) are added to the resin composite to prevent polymerisation of the material during storage, increasing its shelf life.\n\n=== Classification of resin composites according to handling characteristics ===\nThis classification divides resin composite into three broad categories based on their handling characteristics:\n* Universal: advocated for general use, oldest subtype of resin composite\n* Flowable: fluid consistency, used for very small restorations\n* Packable: stiffer, more viscous material used solely for posterior parts of the mouth\n\nManufacturers manipulate the handling characteristics by altering the constituents of the material. Generally, the stiffer materials (packable) exhibit a higher filler content whilst fluid materials (flowable) exhibit lower filler loading.\n\n'''Universal:'''\nThis is the traditional presentation of resin composites and performs well in many situations. However, their use is limited in specialised practice where more complex aesthetic treatments are undertaken. Indications include: the restoration of class I, II and III and IV where aesthetics is not paramount, and the repair of non-carious tooth surface loss (NCTSL) lesions. Contraindications include: restoration of ultraconservative cavities, in areas where aesthetics is critical, and where insufficient enamel is available for etching.\n[[File:Flowable composite.jpg|thumb|263x263px|The use of flowable composite in early decay of lower molar teeth.]]\n'''Flowable:'''\nFlowable composites represent a relatively newer subset of resin-based composite material, dating back to the mid-1990s. Compared to universal composite, flowables have a reduced filler content (37\u201353%) thereby exhibiting ease of handling, lower viscosity, compressive strength, wear resistance and greater polymerisation shrinkage. Due to the poorer mechanical properties, flowable composites should be used with caution in high stress-bearing areas. However, due to its favourable wetting properties, it can adapt intimately to enamel and dentine surfaces. Indications include: restoration of small class I cavities, preventive resin restorations (PRR), fissure sealants, cavity liners, repair of deficient amalgam margins, and class V (abfraction) lesions caused by NCTSL. Contraindications include: in high stress-bearing areas, restoration of large multi-surface cavities, and if effective moisture control is unattainable.\n\n'''Packable:'''\nPackable composites were developed to be used in posterior situations. Unlike flowable composite, they exhibit a higher viscosity thereby necessitating greater force upon application to 'pack' the material into the prepared cavity. Their handling characteristics is more similar to dental amalgam, in that greater force is required to condense the material into the cavity. Therefore, they can be thought of as 'tooth-coloured amalgam'. The increased viscosity is achieved by a higher filler content (>60% by volume) \u2013 thereby making the material stiffer and more resistant to fracture, two properties that are ideal for materials to be used in the posterior region of the mouth. The disadvantage of the associated increased filler content is the potential risk of introducing voids along the cavity walls and between each layer of material. In order to seal any marginal deficiencies, the use of a single layer of flowable composite at the base of a cavity has been advocated when undertaking Class II posterior composite restorations when using packable composite.\n\n==Indirect dental composites==\n\nIndirect composite is cured outside the mouth, in a processing unit that is capable of delivering higher intensities and levels of energy than handheld lights can. Indirect composites can have higher filler levels, are cured for longer times and curing shrinkage can be handled in a better way.\nAs a result, they are less prone to shrinkage stress and marginal gaps<ref name=\"ElevenYearEvaluation\">Composite resin fillings and inlays.

For example, an entire crown can be cured in a single process cycle in an extra-oral curing unit, compared to a millimeter layer of a filling.\n\nAs a result, full crowns and even bridges (replacing multiple teeth) can be fabricated with these systems.\n\nIndirect dental composites can be used for:\n* Filling [[Dental caries|cavities]] in teeth, as fillings, [[Inlays and onlays|inlays and/or onlays]]\n* Filling gaps (diastemas) between teeth using a shell-like veneer or\n* Reshaping of teeth\n* Full or partial [[Crown (dentistry)|crown]]s on single teeth\n* Bridges spanning 2-3 teeth\n\nA stronger, tougher and more durable product is expected in principle.

They form the family '''Furnariidae'''. The [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla''), which breeds in [[North America]], is not a furnariid \u2013 rather it is a distantly related bird of the [[New World warbler|wood warbler]] family, Parulidae.\n\nThe ovenbirds are a diverse group of [[insectivore]]s which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely \"oven-like\" clay nests built by the [[hornero]]s, although most other ovenbirds build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock.<ref name=Remsen2003>Remsen, J.

Lynx Edicions, Barcelona.</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"oven\" ''(horno)'' gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid. The eggs hatch after  15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.<ref name=EoB>{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Willis, Edwin O.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 162\u2013163|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}}</ref>\n\nThey are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from 9 to 35&nbsp;cm in length.<ref name=EoB/> While individual species often are habitat specialists, species of this family can be found in virtually any [[Neotropical]] habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by [[rufous hornero]]s, to tropical [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren [[Andean]] highlands inhabited by several species of [[Geositta|miners]]. Two species, the [[Chilean seaside cinclodes|seaside]] and the [[surf cinclodes]], are associated with rocky coasts.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nRecently, the [[woodcreeper]]s (formerly Dendrocolaptidae) were merged into this family, following analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]].<ref name=Irestedt2002/> While confirming the overall [[phylogenetic]] pattern, other scientists instead opted for maintaining the woodcreepers as a separate family, while splitting the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) into two families, Furnariidae and Scleruridae.<ref name=Moyle/>\n\nThe systematics of the Dendrocolaptinae were reviewed by Raikow (1994)<ref name=Raikow/> based on morphology and by Irestedt ''et al.'' (2004)<ref name=Irestedt2004/> based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Using the latter approach, the suspected major lineages of the Furnariinae (foliage-gleaners, spinetails, and true ovenbirds) were confirmed, but some new lineages were discovered and the relationships of several genera had to be revised.<ref name=Fjeldsa/><ref name=\"DerryberryClaramunt2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Derryberry|first1=Elizabeth P.|last2=Claramunt|first2=Santiago|last3=Derryberry|first3=Graham|last4=Chesser|first4=R.

They form the family '''Furnariidae'''. The [[ovenbird]] (''Seiurus aurocapilla''), which breeds in [[North America]], is not a furnariid \u2013 rather it is a distantly related bird of the [[New World warbler|wood warbler]] family, Parulidae.\n\nThe ovenbirds are a diverse group of [[insectivore]]s which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely \"oven-like\" clay nests built by the [[hornero]]s, although most other ovenbirds build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock.<ref name=Remsen2003>Remsen, J. V., Jr. 2003. Family Furnariidae (ovenbirds). Pages 162\u2013357 in J. del Hoyo, A. Elliott and D. A. Christie eds. Handbook of the birds of the world, Vol. 8, broadbills to tapaculos. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona.</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"oven\" ''(horno)'' gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid. The eggs hatch after  15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.<ref name=EoB>{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author= Willis, Edwin O.|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher= Merehurst Press|location=London|pages= 162\u2013163|isbn= 978-1-85391-186-6}}</ref>\n\nThey are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from 9 to 35&nbsp;cm in length.<ref name=EoB/> While individual species often are habitat specialists, species of this family can be found in virtually any [[Neotropical]] habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by [[rufous hornero]]s, to tropical [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian]] lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren [[Andean]] highlands inhabited by several species of [[Geositta|miners]]. Two species, the [[Chilean seaside cinclodes|seaside]] and the [[surf cinclodes]], are associated with rocky coasts.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nRecently, the [[woodcreeper]]s (formerly Dendrocolaptidae) were merged into this family, following analysis of [[DNA sequence|sequences]].<ref name=Irestedt2002/> While confirming the overall [[phylogenetic]] pattern, other scientists instead opted for maintaining the woodcreepers as a separate family, while splitting the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) into two families, Furnariidae and Scleruridae.<ref name=Moyle/>\n\nThe systematics of the Dendrocolaptinae were reviewed by Raikow (1994)<ref name=Raikow/> based on morphology and by Irestedt ''et al.'' (2004)<ref name=Irestedt2004/> based on analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Using the latter approach, the suspected major lineages of the Furnariinae (foliage-gleaners, spinetails, and true ovenbirds) were confirmed, but some new lineages were discovered and the relationships of several genera had to be revised.<ref name=Fjeldsa/><ref name=\"DerryberryClaramunt2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Derryberry|first1=Elizabeth P.|last2=Claramunt|first2=Santiago|last3=Derryberry|first3=Graham|last4=Chesser|first4=R.

{"title_page": "Dental impression", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Alginate impression body.jpg|thumb|An impression body, made from [[alginate]] impression material.]]\n[[File:Toothmold.jpg|thumb|A custom dental model or cast.]]\n\nA '''dental impression''' is a negative imprint of hard (teeth) and soft tissues in the mouth from which a positive reproduction (cast or model) can be formed. It is made by placing an appropriate material in a stock or custom dental impression tray which is designed to roughly fit over the dental arches. Impression material is of liquid or semi-solid nature when first mixed and placed in the mouth. It then sets to become an elastic solid (usually takes a few minutes depending upon the material), leaving an imprint of person's [[dentition]] and surrounding structures of oral cavity.\n\n== Uses ==\nImpressions, and the study models, are used in several areas of dentistry including:\n* diagnosis and treatment planning\n* [[prosthodontic]]s (such as making [[denture]]s)\n* [[orthodontics]]\n* [[restorative dentistry]] (e.g. to make impressions of teeth which have been prepared to receive indirect extracoronal restorations such as crowns, bridges, inlays and onlays)                            [[File:Wax mock up.jpg|thumb|Wax mock up of crowns on a cast made from an impression]]\n* [[maxillofacial prosthetics]] (prosthetic rehabilitation of intra-oral and extra-oral defects due to trauma, congenital defects, and surgical resection of tumors) \n* [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] for both intra-oral and or extra-oral aims (e.g. [[dental implant]]s)\nThe required type of material for taking an impression and the area that it covers will depend on the clinical indication. Common materials used for dental impressions are:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials|last=J.|first=Bonsor, Stephen|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|others=Pearson, Gavin J.|isbn=9780702031588|location=Amsterdam|pages=243\u2013251|oclc=824491168}}</ref>\n* non rigid materials: \n** reversible hydrocolloids: [[agar]]\n** irreversible hydrocolloids: [[sodium alginate]]\n** elastomeric materials: \n*** [[silicone]]s ([[polyvinyl siloxane]]): [[condensation]]-[[curing (chemistry)|cured]] silicones, addition silicones, vinyl polyether silicones (VPES)\n*** polyethers\n*** polysulphides\n* rigid materials:\n** [[plaster of Paris]]\n** impression compound\n** zinc oxide and eugenol-based impression paste\n\n==Techniques for taking impression ==\nImpressions can also be described as '''mucostatic''' or '''mucocompressive''', being defined both by the impression material used and the type of impression tray used (i.e. spaced or closely adapted). ''Mucostatic'' means that the impression is taken with the mucosa in its normal resting position. These impressions will generally lead to a denture which has a good fit during rest, but during chewing, the denture will tend to pivot around incompressible areas (e.g. [[torus palatinus]]) and dig into compressible areas. ''Mucocompressive'' means that the impression is taken when the mucosa is subject to compression. These impressions will generally lead to a denture that is most stable during function but not at rest. Dentures are at rest most of the time, so it could be argued that mucostatic impressions make better dentures, however in reality it is likely that tissue adaption to the presence of either a denture made with a mucostatic or a mucocompressive technique make little difference between the two in the long term.\nAnother type of impression technique is selective pressure technique in which stress bearing areas are compressed and stress relief areas are relieved such that both the advantages of muco static and muco compressive techniques are achieved.\n\n** User Guide of Dental Impression material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-keGMbCHC2A\n\n==Special techniques==\n\n* \"Wash impression\" \u2013 this is a very thin layer of low viscosity impression material which is used to record fine details. Usually it is the second stage, where the runny impression material is used after an initial impression taken with a more viscous material.\n* Two phase one stage: the putty and low body weight impression materials are inserted to the mouth at once .\n* Two phase two stage: first the putty is set in the mouth then low body weight material is added on the top of ready impression and inserted to the mouth to get the final accurate impression\n* Functional impression (also known as secondary impression)\n* [[Neutral zone (dentistry)|Neutral zone]] impression\n* Window technique\n* Altered cast technique\n* Applegate technique\n\n=== Impression for provision of fixed prosthesis ===\nWhen taking impression for provision of crown and bridge work, the preparation border needs to be accurately captured by the light bodied impression material. For this reason, the gingival tissues need to be pushed away from the preparation margin in order to make it accessible to the impression material. One way to retract gingival tissues away from the tooth is by insertion of a retraction cord into the [[Gingival sulcus|gingival crevice]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=John F. McCabe, Angus W. G. Walls|publisher=Wiley|year=1990|isbn=978-1-118-69712-2|location=|pages=143}}</ref>\n\n==Impression materials==\nImpression materials can be considered as follows:\n\n===Rigid===\n\n==== Plaster of Paris (impression plaster) ====\nPlaster of Paris is traditionally used as a casting material once the impression has been taken, however its use as an impression material is occasionally useful in edentate patients.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Clinical Guide to Applied Dental Materials|last=Stephen J. Bonsor, Gavin J. Pearson|publisher=Elsevier|year=2013|isbn=978-0-7020-3158-8|location=United Kingdom|pages=237\u2013273}}</ref> The tissues are not displaced during impression taking, hence the material is termed ''mucostatic.'' Mainly composed of \u03b2-calcium sulphate hemihydrate, impression plaster has a similar composition and setting reaction to the casting material with an increase in certain components to control the initial expansion that is observed with Plaster of Paris. Additionally, more water is added to the powder than with the casting material to aid in good flow during impression taking. As the impression material is very similar to the casting material to be used, it requires the incorporation of a separating medium (e.g. sodium alginate) to aid in separating the cast from the impression. If a special tray is to be used, impression plaster requires 1\u20131.5mm spacing for adequate thickness.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Hydrophilic\n* Good detail reproduction\n* Good dimensional stability (contraction on setting)\n* Good patient tolerance\n* 2\u20133 minutes working time\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Brittle\n* No recovery from deformation. Therefore, if an undercut is present the material will have to be broken off the impression and then glued back together prior to casting\n* Excess salivation by the patient could have adverse effect on detail reproduction\n\n==== Impression compound ====\nImpression compound has been used for many years as an impression material for removable prostheses. Although its use has recently declined with the advent of better materials. Due to its poor flow characteristics, it is unable to reproduce fine detail and so its use is somewhat limited to the following scenarios:\n* Primary impressions of complete dentures\n* Border moulding of trays\n* Extension of trays\n* Achieving mucocompression in the post-dam area when working impressions are taken for complete dentures\nImpression compound is a thermoplastic material; it is presented as a sheet of material, which is warmed in hot water (> 55\u201360&nbsp;\u00b0C) for one minute, and loaded on a tray prior to impression taking. Once in the mouth, the material will harden and record the detail of the soft tissues. The impression can further be hardened by placing it in cold water after use. Impressions with compound should be poured within an hour as the material exhibits poor dimensional stability. There are two main presentations of impression compound: red compound and greenstick. The latter is mainly used for border moulding and recording the post-dam area.\n\n==== Vinyl polysiloxane impression material (impression material) ====\nvinyl polysiloxane dental impression materials used for making accurate dental impressions with excellent reproducibility. It is available in Putty and light body consistencies to aid dentists make perfect impressions for fabrication of crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays and veneers.\nExample [https://www.gcindiadental.com/products/impression-making/flexceed/ Flexceed]\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Better reproduction detail with two viscosities (Putty & Light Body)\n* Exhibits pseudo-plastic properties for precision which is not found in alginates\n* Superior tear strength than any other VPS material\n* Better dimensional stability \u2013 multiple models can be poured up to two weeks\n* Good hydrophilicity\n* Compatible with gypsum products\n* Superior wetting characteristics ensuring gypsum working cast is hard with smooth surface\n* Can be subjected to cold sterilization without compromising the details and dimensional stability of the impression\n\n==== Zinc-oxide eugenol plaster (impression paste) ====\nImpression paste is traditionally used to take the working (secondary) impressions for a complete denture. When used with a special tray it requires 1&nbsp;mm of spacing to allow for enough thickness of the material; this is also termed a ''close fitting'' special tray.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is available as a two-paste system:\n* Base paste: zinc oxide \n* Catalyst paste: eugenol \nThe two pastes should be used in equal amounts and blended together with a stainless steel spatula (Clarident spatula) on a paper pad. Zinc-oxide Eugenol plaster will produce a mucostatic impression.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Thermoplastic \u2013 can be heated to aid removal from the casting material\n* Good detail reproduction\n* Good dimensional stability (0.15% shrinkage on setting)\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Rigid \u2013 presence of undercuts can distort the final material or cause the section engaged to separate from resultant impression\n\n== Impression waxes ==\n\n===Non rigid===\n\n====Hydrocolloid====\n\n===== Agar =====\n[[Agar]] is a material which provides high accuracy. Therefore, it is used in [[fixed prosthodontics]] (crowns, bridges) or when a dental model has to be duplicated by a dental technician.  Agar is a true hydrophilic material, hence the teeth do not need to be dried before placing it into the mouth.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is a reversible hydrocolloid which means that its physical state can be changed by altering its temperature which allows to reuse the material multiple times. The material comes in form of tubes or cartridges. A special hardware is required in the process of taking agar impressions, namely a water bath and rim lock trays with coiled edges allowing passage of cold water for cooling the material to set while in the mouth. The bath consists of three containers filled with water at different temperatures: the first is set at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C to liquefy the agar, the second is used to lower down the temperature of the material for safe intra-oral use (usually set at 43\u201346&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the third one is used for storage and is set at 63\u201366&nbsp;\u00b0C. The storage container can maintain agar tubes and cartridges at temperature 63\u201366&nbsp;\u00b0C for several days for convenient immediate use. The tray is connected to a hose, material is loaded onto the tray and placed in the mouth over the preparation \u2013 an adequate thickness of the material is required, otherwise distortion may occur upon removal from the mouth. The other end of the hose is connected to a cold water source. The hydrocolloid is then cooled down through the tray wall which results in setting of the material.

The overall setting double composition reaction is as follows:\n\n''Potassium (sodium) alginate + calcium sulphate dihydrate + water \u2192 calcium alginate + potassium (sodium) sulphate''\n\nSodium phosphate is added as a retarder which preferentially reacts with calcium ions to delay the set of the material.\n\nAlginate has a mixing time of 45\u201360 secs, a working time of 45 secs (fast set) and 75 secs (regular set). The setting time can be between 1 \u2013 4.5 mins which can be varied by the temperature of water used: the cooler the water, the slower the set and vice versa. You want to ensure that the material is fully set before removal from the mouth.\n\nThe water content that the completed impression is exposed to must be controlled. Improper storage can either result in [[Syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]] (the material contracts upon standing and exudes liquid) or [[imbibition]] (water uptake which is uncontrolled in extent and direction). Therefore, the impression must be stored correctly, which involves wrapping the set material in a damp tissue and storing it in a sealed polythene bag until the impression can be cast. Alginate is used in dental circumstances when less accuracy is required. For example, this includes the creation of study casts to plan dental cases and design [[prosthesis]], and also to create the primary and working impressions for denture construction.\n\nSeveral faults can be encountered when using an alginate impression material, but these can generally be avoided through adequate mixing, correct speculation, correct storage of the set material, and timely pouring of the impression.\n\nDue to the increased accuracy of elastomers, they are recommended for taking secondary impressions over alginate. Patients both preferred the overall experience of having an impression taken with an elastomer than with alginate, and also favoured the resultant dentures produced.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hyde|first1=T.P|last2=Craddock|first2=H.L|last3=Gray|first3=J.C|last4=Pavitt|first4=S.H|last5=Hulme|first5=C|last6=Godfrey|first6=M|last7=Fernandez|first7=C|last8=Navarro-Coy|first8=N|last9=Dillon|first9=S|last10=Wright|first10=J|last11=Brown|first11=S|last12=Dukanovic|first12=G|last13=Brunton|first13=P.A|title=A Randomised Controlled Trial of complete denture impression materials|journal=Journal of Dentistry|date=2013|volume=42|issue=8|pages=895\u2013901|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2014.02.005|pmid=24995473|pmc=4119301}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages:\n* Easy flow \n* Cheap \n* Reproduction of adequate detail \n* Fast setting time \n* Minimal tissue displacement in the mouth\n\nDisadvantages:\n* It has poor dimensional stability\n* Poor tear strength\n* If it is unsupported, it distorts\n* Easy to include air during mixing\n* A minimum thickness of 3&nbsp; mm is required which is hard to achieve in thin areas in between the teeth\n* To buy best quality impression material you can get online dental material companies like  \n*[https://www.adentalls.com/product-category/dental-material/impression-material/.html Al-Falah Dental Supply]\n\n=== Non-aqueous elastomeric impression materials ===\nAs stated above, there are times clinically where the accuracy of an alginate impression is not acceptable, particularly for the construction of [[fixed prosthodontics]]. Agar may be used but as discussed has a number of technical difficulties in its use. As such elastomers were developed to capture the fine detail and accuracy required.\n\n==== Polysulphides ====\n[[Polysulphide]]s have become increasingly unpopular due to their unpleasant taste/smell. The material is presented as a paste to paste system mixed by a dental nurse prior to use. The material sets by a condensation polymerisation reaction. Initially the polymer chains increase in length causing a slight increase in temperature, of 3\u20134&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is then followed by cross linking of the polymer chains and finally the release of water as a by product. This later reaction slightly contracts the material making it stiffer and more resistant to permanent deformation. When poured and cast this slight contraction means the resulting model is slightly larger and as such creates space for the luting cement.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Good tear resistance\n* Dimensionally stable \u2013 some shrinkage on set with release of by-product\n* Good Accuracy\n* Most flexible elastomer\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Reduced patient satisfaction \u2013&nbsp;distinct unpleasant taste and smell\n* Long setting time\n* Requires excellent moisture control\n* Difficult to mix\n\n==== Polyethers ====\n[[Polyethers]] are the most hydrophilic impression material of the hydrophobic elastomers. This property makes it a commonly used material in general practice as it more likely to capture preparation margins when moisture control is not perfect.\n\nPresented as a paste to paste system the material is often used with a monophase impression technique, meaning both the material syringed round the preparation and the bulk within the tray are the same material. Note when mixing polyether the base to accelerator ratio is not 1:1 with most elastomers but 1:4.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Most [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] elastomeric impression material\n* Dimensionally stable \u2013 minimal shrinkage on set with release of by-product\n* Good accuracy\n* Monophase impression\n* Good tear resistance\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Can be too stiff \u2013 deep undercuts and space under a bridge [[Fixed prosthodontics|pontic]] should be blocked out with soft (modelling) wax to prevent inadvertently removing bridge with impression\nIndications:\n* [[Fixed prosthodontics|Indirect cast restorations]], especially in cases where moisture control cannot be guaranteed\n* Locating and the pick up of [[Dental implant|implant]] analogues in preparation for placement of superstructure\n* Functional impression taking in removable prosthodontics\n\n==== Silicones ====\n[[File:Keep-smiling-5.jpg|thumb|Impression taken with silicon]]\nThere are two types of [[silicone]] impression material, addition and condensation (reflecting each of their setting reactions). Silicones are inherently hydrophobic and as such require excellent moisture control for optimal use.\n\n===== Addition silicone =====\nAddition silicones have become the most used impression material in advanced restorative dentistry. There are many forms available, based on their differing amounts of filler content. This dictates the flow properties of each type with more filler resulting in a thicker, less flowable material. The most common forms are: extra light-bodied (low filler content), light-bodied, universal or medium-bodied, heavy-bodied and putty (high filler content). However each type follows the same addition polymerisation reaction and is presented as a paste to paste system. The reaction does not produce any by-product making it dimensionally stable and very accurate.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Good detail reproduction\n* Excellent dimensional stability \u2013 no shrinkage on set\n* High patient acceptance\n* More than one model can be poured from one cast\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Hydrophobe|Hydrophobic]] \u2013 requires excellent moisture control\n* Too accurate \u2013 impression may not be compensated for during [[Investment casting|investment]] and casting, resulting in too small a die being produced and subsequently too small a restoration.\n* Poor tear resistance\n* Expensive\nIndications:\n* Indirect cast restorations\n* Multiple models required\n* Impressions for [[Dentures|removable prosthodontics]] &nbsp;\n* Bite registration material\nContraindications\n* Inadequate moisture control\n\n===== Condensation silicone =====\nCondensation silicones are commonly used as a putty, paste or light bodied material. The systems are usually presented as a paste or putty and a liquid/paste catalyst; meaning accurate proportioning is difficult to achieve resulting in varied outcomes. For example, the setting reaction of putty is started by kneading a low viscosity paste accelerator into a bulk of silicone with high filler content.\n\nAs stated the material sets by a condensation reaction forming a three-dimensional silicone matrix whilst releasing ethyl alcohol as a by-product. This in turn results in a minimally exothermic set with marked shrinkage on setting (shrinkage being relative to filler content, where high filler content has reduced shrinkage).\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Accurate\n* High patient acceptance\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Hydrophobic \u2013 requires excellent moisture control\n* Unreliable dimensional stability \u2013 difficult to accurately proportion components leading to variable results\n* Marked shrinkage on setting with release of by-product\nIndications:\n* Indirect cast restorations\n* Matrices for indirect/direct restoration\n* Working impressions for metal based removable prosthodontics and relines\n* Lab putty\n\n==Impression trays==\n\nAn impression tray is a container which holds the impression material as it sets, and supports the set impression until after casting. Impression trays can be separated into two main categories- stock trays and special trays.\n\n===Stock trays===\n\nStock trays are used to take primary impressions and come in a range of sizes and shapes, and can be plastic or metal. Stock trays can be rounded (designed to fit the mouths of people with no remaining teeth) or squared (designed to fit people with some remaining teeth). They can be full arch, covering all the teeth in either the upper or lower jaw in one impression, or a partial coverage tray, designed to fit over about three teeth (used when making crowns). The stock tray with the closest size and shape to the patient's own arch dimensions is selected for impressions.\n\nStock trays must meet various requirements in order to obtain a satisfactory impression. A good stock tray will:\n* Be rigid enough to endure the force of the dental impression material being positioned in the mouth. Flexure of the tray under force would cause the tray to be distorted, so when the impression tray is removed the impression would be narrower and distorted. This is particularly important for plastic stock trays.\n* Be of appropriate dimensions to obtain the most accurate impression of the region being reproduced possible. Inadequate extension of an impression tray where the impression material is not supported would likely cause distortions in the impression of the area.\n* Be loose enough around the dental arch to not touch the soft tissues of the mouth.\n* Have a sturdy handle to allow the tray to be easily removed from the mouth.\n* Be easily disinfected, unless for single use. Disposable trays are often preferred due to increasing legislation about infection control in medicine and dentistry.\n\nStock trays can be dentate or edentulous, and perforated (used with alginate) or non-perforated (allows the impression material to run through the holes and increase the bond of the impression material to the tray when set).\n\n====Plastic stock trays====\n\nPlastic stock trays are generally injection moulded from a high-impact styrene such as polystyrene. The Triple Tray is a type of plastic tray used for taking impressions for a crown using the double arch or dual bite impression technique. It is used for taking impressions of the tooth preparation and the opposing teeth, by the use of a special impression material, usually elastomer. The accuracy of the results is however subject to the ability of the patient to close their teeth when the tray is present in the mouth. It cannot produce results of the complete arch, therefore its usefulness is limited.\n\n====Metal stock trays====\n\nMetal stock trays are often preferred over plastic stock trays, due to the lack of rigidity in plastic stock trays. Although expensive to purchase, they have the benefit of being reusable, so can be more cost-efficient in the long-term.\n\n===Special trays===\n\nA special tray is an impression tray custom made for an individual patient by a denturist (dental technician), usually made from acrylic, such as [[polymethyl methacrylate]], or shellac. A stock tray is used to make a preliminary impression, from which a model can be cast. This is then used for wax to make the tray to be laid down. The thickness corresponds to specific spacing, and can be classed as spaced, where about 3mm of space is left between the tray and the mucosa for the impression material to occupy, or closely adapted, where less space is left for the impression material. This is determined by the impression material to be used.\n\nSpecific features can be given to the special tray to improve the accuracy of the impression such as a window which can help to record displaceable tissues such as flabby ridges when used with a less viscous impression material. Special trays can be given perforations if required by drilling holes in tray.\n\nCustomised trays have been less frequently used since the advent of putties. This is due to the putty providing good support for light bodied material, and showing very little dimensional change which provides a fine detailed dental impression. There is now a large increase in the variety of stock trays available.\n\n===Tray adhesives===\n\nTray adhesives are used to ensure the retention of the impression material in the impression tray, with or without the presence of perforations, and are based on contact adhesive technology. Maximum retention can be achieved with the presence of both a tray adhesive and perforations in the impression tray. The adhesive is applied to the internal surface of the tray, as well as over the margins to ensure the binding of the outer edge of the impression material to the tray. A suitable amount of adhesive (usually two thin coats) should be applied to the tray to prevent pooling of the adhesive which can weaken the bond between the tray and impression material. The adhesive should be completely dried prior to impression-taking. \nTray adhesives usually come in a screw-top bottle with a brush attached to the lid that can be used for applying the adhesive. Overtime, the adhesive can accumulate around the cap, causing the evaporation of the solvent, and consequently the thickening of the adhesive. This can reduce the efficacy of the adhesive to bind to the tray.\n\n====Types====\nVarious tray adhesives are available, corresponding to the impression material used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |  Impression materials and corresponding adhesives\n<ref>Bonsor, Stephen, J., Pearson, Gavin, J.

It is made by placing an appropriate material in a stock or custom dental impression tray which is designed to roughly fit over the dental arches. Impression material is of liquid or semi-solid nature when first mixed and placed in the mouth. It then sets to become an elastic solid (usually takes a few minutes depending upon the material), leaving an imprint of person's [[dentition]] and surrounding structures of oral cavity.\n\n== Uses ==\nImpressions, and the study models, are used in several areas of dentistry including:\n* diagnosis and treatment planning\n* [[prosthodontic]]s (such as making [[denture]]s)\n* [[orthodontics]]\n* [[restorative dentistry]] (e.g. to make impressions of teeth which have been prepared to receive indirect extracoronal restorations such as crowns, bridges, inlays and onlays)                            [[File:Wax mock up.jpg|thumb|Wax mock up of crowns on a cast made from an impression]]\n* [[maxillofacial prosthetics]] (prosthetic rehabilitation of intra-oral and extra-oral defects due to trauma, congenital defects, and surgical resection of tumors) \n* [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]] for both intra-oral and or extra-oral aims (e.g. [[dental implant]]s)\nThe required type of material for taking an impression and the area that it covers will depend on the clinical indication.

''Mucostatic'' means that the impression is taken with the mucosa in its normal resting position. These impressions will generally lead to a denture which has a good fit during rest, but during chewing, the denture will tend to pivot around incompressible areas (e.g. [[torus palatinus]]) and dig into compressible areas. ''Mucocompressive'' means that the impression is taken when the mucosa is subject to compression. These impressions will generally lead to a denture that is most stable during function but not at rest. Dentures are at rest most of the time, so it could be argued that mucostatic impressions make better dentures, however in reality it is likely that tissue adaption to the presence of either a denture made with a mucostatic or a mucocompressive technique make little difference between the two in the long term.\nAnother type of impression technique is selective pressure technique in which stress bearing areas are compressed and stress relief areas are relieved such that both the advantages of muco static and muco compressive techniques are achieved.\n\n** User Guide of Dental Impression material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-keGMbCHC2A\n\n==Special techniques==\n\n* \"Wash impression\" \u2013 this is a very thin layer of low viscosity impression material which is used to record fine details. Usually it is the second stage, where the runny impression material is used after an initial impression taken with a more viscous material.\n* Two phase one stage: the putty and low body weight impression materials are inserted to the mouth at once .\n* Two phase two stage: first the putty is set in the mouth then low body weight material is added on the top of ready impression and inserted to the mouth to get the final accurate impression\n* Functional impression (also known as secondary impression)\n* [[Neutral zone (dentistry)|Neutral zone]] impression\n* Window technique\n* Altered cast technique\n* Applegate technique\n\n=== Impression for provision of fixed prosthesis ===\nWhen taking impression for provision of crown and bridge work, the preparation border needs to be accurately captured by the light bodied impression material. For this reason, the gingival tissues need to be pushed away from the preparation margin in order to make it accessible to the impression material. One way to retract gingival tissues away from the tooth is by insertion of a retraction cord into the [[Gingival sulcus|gingival crevice]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=John F.

Mainly composed of \u03b2-calcium sulphate hemihydrate, impression plaster has a similar composition and setting reaction to the casting material with an increase in certain components to control the initial expansion that is observed with Plaster of Paris. Additionally, more water is added to the powder than with the casting material to aid in good flow during impression taking. As the impression material is very similar to the casting material to be used, it requires the incorporation of a separating medium (e.g. sodium alginate) to aid in separating the cast from the impression. If a special tray is to be used, impression plaster requires 1\u20131.5mm spacing for adequate thickness.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Hydrophilic\n* Good detail reproduction\n* Good dimensional stability (contraction on setting)\n* Good patient tolerance\n* 2\u20133 minutes working time\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Brittle\n* No recovery from deformation. Therefore, if an undercut is present the material will have to be broken off the impression and then glued back together prior to casting\n* Excess salivation by the patient could have adverse effect on detail reproduction\n\n==== Impression compound ====\nImpression compound has been used for many years as an impression material for removable prostheses. Although its use has recently declined with the advent of better materials. Due to its poor flow characteristics, it is unable to reproduce fine detail and so its use is somewhat limited to the following scenarios:\n* Primary impressions of complete dentures\n* Border moulding of trays\n* Extension of trays\n* Achieving mucocompression in the post-dam area when working impressions are taken for complete dentures\nImpression compound is a thermoplastic material; it is presented as a sheet of material, which is warmed in hot water (> 55\u201360&nbsp;\u00b0C) for one minute, and loaded on a tray prior to impression taking. Once in the mouth, the material will harden and record the detail of the soft tissues. The impression can further be hardened by placing it in cold water after use. Impressions with compound should be poured within an hour as the material exhibits poor dimensional stability. There are two main presentations of impression compound: red compound and greenstick. The latter is mainly used for border moulding and recording the post-dam area.\n\n==== Vinyl polysiloxane impression material (impression material) ====\nvinyl polysiloxane dental impression materials used for making accurate dental impressions with excellent reproducibility. It is available in Putty and light body consistencies to aid dentists make perfect impressions for fabrication of crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays and veneers.\nExample [https://www.gcindiadental.com/products/impression-making/flexceed/ Flexceed]\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Better reproduction detail with two viscosities (Putty & Light Body)\n* Exhibits pseudo-plastic properties for precision which is not found in alginates\n* Superior tear strength than any other VPS material\n* Better dimensional stability \u2013 multiple models can be poured up to two weeks\n* Good hydrophilicity\n* Compatible with gypsum products\n* Superior wetting characteristics ensuring gypsum working cast is hard with smooth surface\n* Can be subjected to cold sterilization without compromising the details and dimensional stability of the impression\n\n==== Zinc-oxide eugenol plaster (impression paste) ====\nImpression paste is traditionally used to take the working (secondary) impressions for a complete denture. When used with a special tray it requires 1&nbsp;mm of spacing to allow for enough thickness of the material; this is also termed a ''close fitting'' special tray.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is available as a two-paste system:\n* Base paste: zinc oxide \n* Catalyst paste: eugenol \nThe two pastes should be used in equal amounts and blended together with a stainless steel spatula (Clarident spatula) on a paper pad.

Therefore, it is used in [[fixed prosthodontics]] (crowns, bridges) or when a dental model has to be duplicated by a dental technician.  Agar is a true hydrophilic material, hence the teeth do not need to be dried before placing it into the mouth.<ref name=\":1\" /> It is a reversible hydrocolloid which means that its physical state can be changed by altering its temperature which allows to reuse the material multiple times. The material comes in form of tubes or cartridges. A special hardware is required in the process of taking agar impressions, namely a water bath and rim lock trays with coiled edges allowing passage of cold water for cooling the material to set while in the mouth. The bath consists of three containers filled with water at different temperatures: the first is set at 100&nbsp;\u00b0C to liquefy the agar, the second is used to lower down the temperature of the material for safe intra-oral use (usually set at 43\u201346&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the third one is used for storage and is set at 63\u201366&nbsp;\u00b0C. The storage container can maintain agar tubes and cartridges at temperature 63\u201366&nbsp;\u00b0C for several days for convenient immediate use. The tray is connected to a hose, material is loaded onto the tray and placed in the mouth over the preparation \u2013 an adequate thickness of the material is required, otherwise distortion may occur upon removal from the mouth. The other end of the hose is connected to a cold water source. The hydrocolloid is then cooled down through the tray wall which results in setting of the material. The models should be poured as soon as possible to avoid changes in dimensional stability.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern dentistry offers other materials (e.g. elastomerics) which provide high accuracy impressions and are easier to use hence agar is used less frequently.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n* high accuracy\n* hydrophilic \n* reusable\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n* complex procedural steps\n* significant start-up cost of the hardware\n\n===== Alginate =====\n[[Alginic acid|Alginate]], on the other hand, is an irreversible hydrocolloid. It exists in two phases: either as a viscous liquid, or a solid gel, the transition generated by a chemical reaction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bonsor|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Pearson|first2=Gavin J.|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone|isbn=9780702031588|pages=245\u2013248}}</ref>\nThe impression material is created through adding water to the powdered alginate which contains a mixture of sodium and potassium salts of alginic acid. The overall setting double composition reaction is as follows:\n\n''Potassium (sodium) alginate + calcium sulphate dihydrate + water \u2192 calcium alginate + potassium (sodium) sulphate''\n\nSodium phosphate is added as a retarder which preferentially reacts with calcium ions to delay the set of the material.\n\nAlginate has a mixing time of 45\u201360 secs, a working time of 45 secs (fast set) and 75 secs (regular set). The setting time can be between 1 \u2013 4.5 mins which can be varied by the temperature of water used: the cooler the water, the slower the set and vice versa. You want to ensure that the material is fully set before removal from the mouth.\n\nThe water content that the completed impression is exposed to must be controlled. Improper storage can either result in [[Syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]] (the material contracts upon standing and exudes liquid) or [[imbibition]] (water uptake which is uncontrolled in extent and direction). Therefore, the impression must be stored correctly, which involves wrapping the set material in a damp tissue and storing it in a sealed polythene bag until the impression can be cast. Alginate is used in dental circumstances when less accuracy is required. For example, this includes the creation of study casts to plan dental cases and design [[prosthesis]], and also to create the primary and working impressions for denture construction.\n\nSeveral faults can be encountered when using an alginate impression material, but these can generally be avoided through adequate mixing, correct spatulation, correct storage of the set material, and timely pouring of the impression.\n\nDue to the increased accuracy of elastomers, they are recommended for taking secondary impressions over alginate. Patients both preferred the overall experience of having an impression taken with an elastomer than with alginate, and also favoured the resultant dentures produced.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hyde|first1=T.P|last2=Craddock|first2=H.L|last3=Gray|first3=J.C|last4=Pavitt|first4=S.H|last5=Hulme|first5=C|last6=Godfrey|first6=M|last7=Fernandez|first7=C|last8=Navarro-Coy|first8=N|last9=Dillon|first9=S|last10=Wright|first10=J|last11=Brown|first11=S|last12=Dukanovic|first12=G|last13=Brunton|first13=P.A|title=A Randomised Controlled Trial of complete denture impression materials|journal=Journal of Dentistry|date=2013|volume=42|issue=8|pages=895\u2013901|doi=10.1016/j.jdent.2014.02.005|pmid=24995473|pmc=4119301}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages:\n* Easy flow \n* Cheap \n* Reproduction of adequate detail \n* Fast setting time \n* Minimal tissue displacement in the mouth\n\nDisdavantages:\n* It has poor dimensional stability\n* Poor tear strength\n* If it is unsupported, it distorts\n* Easy to include air during mixing\n* A minimum thickness of 3&nbsp;mm is required which is hard to achieve in thin areas in between the teeth\n\n=== Non-aqueous elastomeric impression materials ===\nAs stated above, there are times clinically where the accuracy of an alginate impression is not acceptable, particularly for the construction of [[fixed prosthodontics]]. Agar may be used but as discussed has a number of technical difficulties in its use. As such elastomers were developed to capture the fine detail and accuracy required.\n\n==== Polysulphides ====\n[[Polysulphide]]s have become increasingly unpopular due to their unpleasant taste/smell. The material is presented as a paste to paste system mixed by a dental nurse prior to use. The material sets by a condensation polymerisation reaction. Initially the polymer chains increase in length causing a slight increase in temperature, of 3\u20134&nbsp;\u00b0C. This is then followed by cross linking of the polymer chains and finally the release of water as a by product. This later reaction slightly contracts the material making it stiffer and more resistant to permanent deformation. When poured and cast this slight contraction means the resulting model is slightly larger and as such creates space for the luting cement.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Good tear resistance\n* Dimensionally stable \u2013 some shrinkage on set with release of by-product\n* Good Accuracy\n* Most flexible elastomer\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Reduced patient satisfaction \u2013&nbsp;distinct unpleasant taste and smell\n* Long setting time\n* Requires excellent moisture control\n* Difficult to mix\n\n==== Polyethers ====\n[[Polyethers]] are the most hydrophilic impression material of the hydrophobic elastomers. This property makes it a commonly used material in general practice as it more likely to capture preparation margins when moisture control is not perfect.\n\nPresented as a paste to paste system the material is often used with a monophase impression technique, meaning both the material syringed round the preparation and the bulk within the tray are the same material. Note when mixing polyether the base to accelerator ratio is not 1:1 with most elastomers but 1:4.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Most [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] elastomeric impression material\n* Dimensionally stable \u2013 minimal shrinkage on set with release of by-product\n* Good accuracy\n* Monophase impression\n* Good tear resistance\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Can be too stiff \u2013 deep undercuts and space under a bridge [[Fixed prosthodontics|pontic]] should be blocked out with soft (modelling) wax to prevent inadvertently removing bridge with impression\nIndications:\n* [[Fixed prosthodontics|Indirect cast restorations]], especially in cases where moisture control cannot be guaranteed\n* Locating and the pick up of [[Dental implant|implant]] analogues in preparation for placement of superstructure\n* Functional impression taking in removable prosthodontics\n\n==== Silicones ====\n[[File:Keep-smiling-5.jpg|thumb|Impression taken with silicon]]\nThere are two types of [[silicone]] impression material, addition and condensation (reflecting each of their setting reactions). Silicones are inherently hydrophobic and as such require excellent moisture control for optimal use.\n\n===== Addition silicone =====\nAddition silicones have become the most used impression material in advanced restorative dentistry. There are many forms available, based on their differing amounts of filler content. This dictates the flow properties of each type with more filler resulting in a thicker, less flowable material. The most common forms are: extra light-bodied (low filler content), light-bodied, universal or medium-bodied, heavy-bodied and putty (high filler content). However each type follows the same addition polymerisation reaction and is presented as a paste to paste system. The reaction does not produce any by-product making it dimensionally stable and very accurate.\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Good detail reproduction\n* Excellent dimensional stability \u2013 no shrinkage on set\n* High patient acceptance\n* More than one model can be poured from one cast\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Hydrophobe|Hydrophobic]] \u2013 requires excellent moisture control\n* Too accurate \u2013 impression may not be compensated for during [[Investment casting|investment]] and casting, resulting in too small a die being produced and subsequently too small a restoration.\n* Poor tear resistance\n* Expensive\nIndications:\n* Indirect cast restorations\n* Multiple models required\n* Impressions for [[Dentures|removable prosthodontics]] &nbsp;\n* Bite registration material\nContraindications\n* Inadequate moisture control\n\n===== Condensation silicone =====\nCondensation silicones are commonly used as a putty, paste or light bodied material. The systems are usually presented as a paste or putty and a liquid/paste catalyst; meaning accurate proportioning is difficult to achieve resulting in varied outcomes. For example, the setting reaction of putty is started by kneading a low viscosity paste accelerator into a bulk of silicone with high filler content.\n\nAs stated the material sets by a condensation reaction forming a three-dimensional silicone matrix whilst releasing ethyl alcohol as a by-product. This in turn results in a minimally exothermic set with marked shrinkage on setting (shrinkage being relative to filler content, where high filler content has reduced shrinkage).\n\nAdvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Accurate\n* High patient acceptance\nDisadvantages:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Hydrophobic \u2013 requires excellent moisture control\n* Unreliable dimensional stability \u2013 difficult to accurately proportion components leading to variable results\n* Marked shrinkage on setting with release of by-product\nIndications:\n* Indirect cast restorations\n* Matrices for indirect/direct restoration\n* Working impressions for metal based removable prosthodontics and relines\n* Lab putty\n\n==Impression trays==\n\nAn impression tray is a container which holds the impression material as it sets, and supports the set impression until after casting. Impression trays can be separated into two main categories- stock trays and special trays.\n\n===Stock trays===\n\nStock trays are used to take primary impressions and come in a range of sizes and shapes, and can be plastic or metal. Stock trays can be rounded (designed to fit the mouths of people with no remaining teeth) or squared (designed to fit people with some remaining teeth). They can be full arch, covering all the teeth in either the upper or lower jaw in one impression, or a partial coverage tray, designed to fit over about three teeth (used when making crowns). The stock tray with the closest size and shape to the patient's own arch dimensions is selected for impressions.\n\nStock trays must meet various requirements in order to obtain a satisfactory impression. A good stock tray will:\n* Be rigid enough to endure the force of the dental impression material being positioned in the mouth. Flexure of the tray under force would cause the tray to be distorted, so when the impression tray is removed the impression would be narrower and distorted. This is particularly important for plastic stock trays.\n* Be of appropriate dimensions to obtain the most accurate impression of the region being reproduced possible. Inadequate extension of an impression tray where the impression material is not supported would likely cause distortions in the impression of the area.\n* Be loose enough around the dental arch to not touch the soft tissues of the mouth.\n* Have a sturdy handle to allow the tray to be easily removed from the mouth.\n* Be easily disinfected, unless for single use. Disposable trays are often preferred due to increasing legislation about infection control in medicine and dentistry.\n\nStock trays can be dentate or edentulous, and perforated (used with alginate) or non-perforated (allows the impression material to run through the holes and increase the bond of the impression material to the tray when set).\n\n====Plastic stock trays====\n\nPlastic stock trays are generally injection moulded from a high-impact styrene such as polystyrene. The Triple Tray is a type of plastic tray used for taking impressions for a crown using the double arch or dual bite impression technique. It is used for taking impressions of the tooth preparation and the opposing teeth, by the use of a special impression material, usually elastomer. The accuracy of the results is however subject to the ability of the patient to close their teeth when the tray is present in the mouth. It cannot produce results of the complete arch, therefore its usefulness is limited.\n\n====Metal stock trays====\n\nMetal stock trays are often preferred over plastic stock trays, due to the lack of rigidity in plastic stock trays. Although expensive to purchase, they have the benefit of being reusable, so can be more cost-efficient in the long-term.\n\n===Special trays===\n\nA special tray is an impression tray custom made for an individual patient by a denturist (dental technician), usually made from acrylic, such as [[polymethyl methacrylate]], or shellac. A stock tray is used to make a preliminary impression, from which a model can be cast. This is then used for wax to make the tray to be laid down. The thickness corresponds to specific spacing, and can be classed as spaced, where about 3mm of space is left between the tray and the mucosa for the impression material to occupy, or closely adapted, where less space is left for the impression material. This is determined by the impression material to be used.\n\nSpecific features can be given to the special tray to improve the accuracy of the impression such as a window which can help to record displaceable tissues such as flabby ridges when used with a less viscous impression material. Special trays can be given perforations if required by drilling holes in tray.\n\nCustomised trays have been less frequently used since the advent of putties. This is due to the putty providing good support for light bodied material, and showing very little dimensional change which provides a fine detailed dental impression. There is now a large increase in the variety of stock trays available.\n\n===Tray adhesives===\n\nTray adhesives are used to ensure the retention of the impression material in the impression tray, with or without the presence of perforations, and are based on contact adhesive technology. Maximum retention can be achieved with the presence of both a tray adhesive and perforations in the impression tray. The adhesive is applied to the internal surface of the tray, as well as over the margins to ensure the binding of the outer edge of the impression material to the tray. A suitable amount of adhesive (usually two thin coats) should be applied to the tray to prevent pooling of the adhesive which can weaken the bond between the tray and impression material. The adhesive should be completely dried prior to impression-taking. \nTray adhesives usually come in a screw-top bottle with a brush attached to the lid that can be used for applying the adhesive. Overtime, the adhesive can accumulate around the cap, causing the evaporation of the solvent, and consequently the thickening of the adhesive. This can reduce the efficacy of the adhesive to bind to the tray.\n\n====Types====\nVarious tray adhesives are available, corresponding to the impression material used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" |  Impression materials and corresponding adhesives\n<ref>Bonsor, Stephen, J., Pearson, Gavin, J.

{"title_page": "Uhlenburg", "text_new": "[[File:Uhlenburg Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.1|Hill of the main part of the castle. Right: the rampart]]\n'''Uhlenburg''' is the site (''[[Burgstall]]'') of a [[lowland castle]] that was built in the 14th century close to the [[Aller (Germany)|River Aller]] near [[Essel]] in the German state of [[Lower Saxony]]. This [[Late Middle Ages]] aristocratic seat only existed for a few decades towards the end of the 14th century and was destroyed by force in 1393/94.\n\n== Location ==\nThe castle site lies roughly a kilometre east of [[Essel]] and about 1&nbsp;km north of [[Buchholz (Aller)]] in the flood plain of the Aller valley at a height of 25 m above [[Normalnull|N.N.]]. The site is located in a loop of the river, about 250 m from the Aller itself. The former castle terrain, like the rest of the wide valley is extensively used as [[pasture]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Uhlenburg Steinsch\u00fcttung.jpg|thumb|Southern slope of the keep by the present-day pond. 2004 stone reinforcement to prevent erosion]]\n[[File:Uhlenburg Wallanschnitt.jpg|thumb|Erosion on a section of the rampart]]\n[[File:Uhlenburg Bodenunebenheiten.jpg|thumb|Uneven ground on the motte]]\nUhlenburg consisted of a small [[inner ward]] and a large [[outer ward]] that adjoined its northern side. The almost square inner bailey was built on a [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] with sides some 30 metres long. Today it only has a height of about 1.5 metres and a pond borders it to the south. In 2004 the banks of the pond were reinforced with stones to prevent erosion. West of the motte a rampart guards the ditch. The entire complex was surrounded by a castle [[moat|ditch]] and it is possible that the two wards were on islands surrounded by a large area of water. On the eastern side of the motte is a flat depression on an area of 11 x 20 m. An embankment runs from here across the ditch, so it can be assumed that this was the entrance. In the pond a row of stakes was found that belonged to the old castle and could have been part of a [[palisade]]. \n\nThe terrain of the outer bailey is slightly raised above the surrounding lowland. It is roughly 100 m long and up to 40 m wide. The whole castle site is surrounding by a narrow stretch of water, which in the west and north could have been a loop in the old course of the Aller.\n\n== Archaeological excavations ==\nIt is probable that the first, apparently rather amateurish, excavations on the castle site took place in 1906. This unearthed a number of iron objects, including a chain. In 1926 excavations were carried out by a teacher and his pupil. According to the records the debris of a building was found in the area of the keep but no plan could be established. The find included pieces of brick, clay, boulders, pieces of pottery and bones. Particularly interesting was the presence of charcoal everywhere, which led to the conclusion that the castle was destroyed by a fire. \n\nIn 2001 the castle site attracted strong interest from archaeologists due to the well-preserved state of its ruins. Since then a comprehensive investigation has been carried out. This included physical inspections of the site, a [[magnetometer|magnetic survey]], ground resistance measurements and [[aerial photography]]. The results showed that the earth mound of the motte conceals a layer of rubble. Wooden stakes found in the wet soil underground were submitted for [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological dating]] and found to date from around 1370\u20131380. Other finds during the ground inspections were shards of pottery and pieces of roof tile. One exceptional find was the discovery of a [[Seal (impression)|seal]] stamp made of a lead-tin [[alloy]] which portrayed the [[coat of arms]] of the lords of [[Hademstorf]] as the former lords of the castle.\n \nIn spite of intensive surveying, a more recent excavation has not been carried out and is not planned. The historic monument can be reserved for future research as the conditions in the wet valley of the Aller are ideal for its preservation.\n\n== History ==\nThe owners of the castle were the lords of [[Hademstorf]], whose family line was first mentioned in 1237. In 1372 the brothers Bruno, Johann and Heinrich were recorded as lords of Hademsdorf. Uhlenburg was mentioned in a deed dated 1394. In this, the lords of Hademsdorf complained to the L\u00fcneburg district administrator (''Landrat''), that the [[Duchy of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Dukes of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]  [[Henry the Mild, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Henry I]] and [[Bernard I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Bernard I]] had destroyed Uhlenburg, an act which contravened the L\u00fcneburg Treaty (''[[L\u00fcneburger Sate]]''). Presumably the dukes were attacking the local nobility in order to extend their territory and gain control over the toll sites on the Aller. According to the deed the keep and two ladies chambers were destroyed; other buildings had been saved. In 1410, after his imprisonment, Heinrich von Hademsdorf swore an oath of truce (''Urfehde'') with Henry I. It is not known if the imprisonment was connected with the destruction of Uhlenburg.\n\n== Similar fortifications in the local area ==\nWithin the neighbourhood, in the valley of the [[Aller (Germany)|Aller]], there is a number of other medieval castles, some of similar design. These fortifications include those in [[Bierde]], [[Ahlden (Aller)|Ahlden]] ([[Bunkenburg]]), [[Essel]] ([[Blankenburg Castle (Essel)|Blankenburg Castle]]), [[Hodenhagen]] ([[Hodenhagen Castle]]), [[Rethem (Aller)|Rethem]] and [[Grethem]] ([[Blankenhagen Castle]]). \n\nUhlenburg belongs to the group of former castles, that were researched between 2003 and 2005 by the ''Burgenlandschaft Aller-Leine-Tal'' (B.A.L.T.) project. The project was supported by the European aid programme LEADER+, because it had located castle sites in the [[Aller-Leine Valley]] area.\n\n== Literature ==\n* Burgen im Fluss, Herausgeber: Landkreis Soltau-Fallingbostel, Bad Fallingbostel, 2005, {{ISBN|3-00-017281-5}} \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wz-net.de/newsseiten.php?&artikel=107550415&red=21&ausgabe=27084 Aerial photograph of the castle site] (black and white)\n*[http://www.museum-badfallingbostel.de/3000-20040305_01.html Newspaper report of the castle site and the discoveries in 2003]\n*[http://husp100h.xyz German government]\n\n{{Coord|52.687517|N|9.666252|E|type:landmark_region:DE-NI}}\n\n[[Category:Heidekreis]]\n[[Category:Castles in Lower Saxony]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Germany]]\n[[Category:Heidmark]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Uhlenburg Panorama.jpg|thumb|upright=2.1|Hill of the main part of the castle.
