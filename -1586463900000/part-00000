Located on the west side of the [[Strait of Georgia]], the island is bordered by [[Mayne Island]] to the Southeast, [[Saltspring Island]] to the west and [[Valdes Island]] to the Northwest. Galiano is part of the [[Capital G, British Columbia|Capital Regional District Electoral Area G]], and has a permanent population of 1044 inhabitants as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=DPL&Code1=590004&Geo2=CD&Code2=6204&Data=Count&SearchText=galiano&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, and designated places, 2016 census |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2008-05-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nGaliano takes its name from Spanish explorer [[Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano]], who explored the area in 1792,<ref>{{cite bcgnis|5236|Galiano Island}}</ref> (the island is twinned with his home city - [[Cabra, Spain|Cabra]] in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish province)|C\u00f3rdoba province]], [[Spain]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alcalagaliano.com/ |title=Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Dionisio Alcal\u00e1-Galiano - Inicio |publisher=Alcalagaliano.com |date= |access-date=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228155404/http://www.alcalagaliano.com/ |archive-date=2011-12-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Retrato del brigadier de la Real Arada Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano (ca. 1843) - An\u00f3nimo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano]] (1760-1805)]]\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, Galiano Island was long inhabited by aboriginal people from the [[Penelakut]] First Nation as well as other [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] peoples, who used the island as a summer fishing colony. [[Midden pits]] at Montague Harbour suggest at least 3000 years of habitation<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/history.htm|title=Galiano Island: A Historical Sketch|website=galianomuseum.ca|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>. In the late 1770s, before Europeans had even arrived in the area, the small pox epidemic reached the Coast Salish region, killing as much as 30% of region's original population<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/smallpox|title=Smallpox in Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Subsequent outbreaks would reduce the First Nations population even further over the following century.\n\nIn 1792, Spanish navigator Dionisio Galiano was dispatched by the Spanish crown to seek out the rumoured [[Northwest Passage]]. After returning from Nootka sound, Galiano and his two vessels, ''[[Sutil (ship)|Sutil]]'' and ''Mexicana'', entered the Straight of Juan de Fuca later that year. While sailing near modern day Point Roberts, Galiano encountered the Britsh expedition led by Captain [[George Vancouver]]<ref>Kendrick, John (1990). ''The Voyage of'' Sutil ''and'' Mexicana'', 1792: The last Spanish exploration of the Northwest Coast of America''. Spokane, Washington: The Arthur H. Clark Company. pp. 43, 51\u201352, 208\u2013209. </ref>. The two exchanged maps and parted ways on friendly terms, despite the somewhat hostile  [[Nootka Crisis|relations between their mother countries]]. Galiano then proceeded to circumnavigate Vancouver Island, confirming it to indeed be an island, and returned to Mexico shortly after to report his findings. He would later die at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached [[San Francisco]] in 1858, nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] became an important port for miners on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Fraser Canyon gold fields]]. Due to increased interest and in the area, the Royal Navy hydrographer Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was tasked with mapping the area around Galiano Island in 1859, and decided to name the island in honour of the Spanish navigator who had visited the region 67 years prior<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn the early years of European settlement the island\u2019s primary industries were fishing and logging. Poor soil on the island limited the development of widespread agriculture found on other Gulf Islands, such as nearby Saltspring. Early settlement included a pioneer farming community on the shores of \u201cPlumper Pass\u201d (later renamed Active Pass). Other settlers, such as Scotty Georgeson (a Shetland Islander who married a Fraser Valley Sto:lo woman), also held land and had family on Galiano in this early period<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBeginning in the 1870s a small number of Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese, also decided to settle the area for its abundance of fish stock and timber. These Japanese immigrants, primarily from [[Wakayama prefecture]], brought with them methods of charcoal production, who\u2019s evidence can still be found on the island today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/pit-kiln/|title=Japanese Charcoal Pit Kiln|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many of these Japanese settlers continued to operate salteries on the North end of the island until the outbreak of [[internment of Japanese Canadians|war with Japan]].\n\nFollowing confederation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871 and the subsequent the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the nearby Lower Mainland exploded in population. By 1928 this had spilled over, and the small community on Galiano had grown large enough to construct the Galiano Community hall, which is still in use today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/new/pages/2004020022.htm|title=Dance at the Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. In the 1960s logging rights for much of the island were given to [[MacMillan Bloedel]] for resource extraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianostory.com/OVERVIEW.HTM|title=The Story of Galiano Island: across thirty important years|last=Griffiths|first=Margaret|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many environmentally conscious residents objected to the widespread logging, leading to many disputes including ''MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.vlex.com/vid/macmillan-v-galiano-island-681204801|title=Macmillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Enviromentalism and the 1960s counter-culture continue to heavily influence the culture of the island to this day. In 2006 the riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands, to which Galiano is a part, elected Canada's first [[Green Party of Canada|Green]] member of parliament, [[Elizabeth May]].\n\nAs of the 21st century, the logging industry has all but halted on the island, replaced by industries such as tourism and a local art scene.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Arbutus Tree (7743626674).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arbutus menziesii|Arbutus tree]] in Montague Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Roca Seta.JPG|thumb|Sandstone formation on the west coast of Galiano]]\n\nLocated on the western edge of the [[Salish Sea]], Galiano is a long, narrow island, {{convert|27.5|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in length and {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} at its narrowest point.\n\nMount Galiano is Galiano\u2019s highest point, rising 311 metres (1020 feet) above sea level. The summit provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. Just west of Mt. Galiano is Sutil Mountain, an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after Capt. Galiano's flagship. \n\nThe western coast of the island (facing [[Trincomali Channel]]) is characterized by its unique sandstone formations and caves. \n\n===Ecology===\n\nDue to its mild climate, Galiano Island is home to a large variety of animals and plants. In a major flight path for migrating birds, Galiano has hundreds of bird species,<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island Check List | website=iNaturalist.ca | date=2009-07-29 | url=https://inaturalist.ca/check_lists/288913-Galiano-Island-Check-List?iconic_taxon=3 | ref={{sfnref | iNaturalist.ca | 2009}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> such as [[bald eagle]]s, [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s. Off its shores are resident and transient populations of [[Killer whale|orca whales]], [[Harbor seal|seals]], [[Sea otter|otters]], [[Steller sea lion|sea lions]] as well as many other varieties of sea life. The island is also home to a large population of deer.\n\nMany native tree species such as [[arbutus menziesii|Arbutus trees]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coastal douglas fir]] thrive on the island and can be found in abundance. While most of the Island has been logged in the years since European settlement, limited old growth forests still exist, for example on the southern side Bluffs Park <ref>{{Cite report |url=https://galianoconservancy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/final_report_complete.pdf|title=Galiano Island Landscape Classification and Up-close Workshop Series Final Report |first=Kate |last=Emmings |first2=Keith |last2=Erickson |date=June 2004 |publisher=Galiano Conservancy Association}}</ref>.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Galiano Island is classified as [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Warm-Summer Mediterranean (Csb)]] under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system which is characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Similar to the other [[Southern Gulf Islands|Gulf Islands]], the [[rain shadow]] effect of the [[Olympic Mountains|Olympic]] and [[Vancouver Island Ranges|Vancouver Island mountains]], and the moderating effects of the ocean, are the dominant influences on the climate of Galiano Island. The combined effects of low precipitation, warm temperatures, and high number of sunshine hours often result in an annual moisture deficit on Galiano Island from mid-June to early October. This deficit can often reach drought conditions in areas of recent clearcuts and can result in an extreme forest fire hazard in the summer months<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.islandstrustconservancy.ca/media/64549/itfmgmtplanvanillaleafland.pdf|title=Vanilla Leaf Land Nature Reserve (DL 58) Galiano Island Management Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Galiano Island]]\n|metric first = 1\n|single line = 1\n|Jan high C = 6.3\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 10.1\n|Apr high C = 13.0\n|May high C = 16.4\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.8\n|Sep high C = 18.8\n|Oct high C = 13.9\n|Nov high C = 9.5\n|Dec high C = 6.6\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 3.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.1\n|Apr mean C = 8.5\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 14.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 16.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.8\n|Oct mean C = 9.8\n|Nov mean C = 6.2\n|Dec mean C = 3.7\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 0.5\n|Feb low C = 1.1\n|Mar low C = 2.1\n|Apr low C = 4.1\n|May low C = 6.7\n|Jun low C = 9.6\n|Jul low C = 11.2\n|Aug low C = 11.1\n|Sep low C = 8.9\n|Oct low C = 5.8\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 153\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112\n|Mar precipitation mm = 90\n|Apr precipitation mm = 59\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 36\n|Jul precipitation mm = 24\n|Aug precipitation mm = 29\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 98\n|Nov precipitation mm = 165\n|Dec precipitation mm = 162\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = climate-data.org\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salish Orca at Sturdies Bay, Galiano Island.jpg|thumb|left|top|Sturdies Bay, the BC Ferries terminal]]\nGaliano Island is accessible by vehicle via the [[BC Ferries]] terminal at [[Sturdies Bay]], located on [[Active Pass]]. Vehicle and passenger ferry service runs from [[Tsawwassen ferry terminal|Tsawwassen]] ([[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]) on the mainland and [[Swartz Bay]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]) on Vancouver Island most days of the year. Additionally, there are numerous inter-island ferries that connect the Gulf Islands, which are scheduled less frequently.\n\nMoorage is available at several public wharves for boat traffic: Sturdies Bay, (walking distance to the Village), Montague Harbour, Whalers Bay and Retreat Cove. Private moorage is available at Montague Harbour Marina and the Galiano Oceanfront Inn (Sturdies Bay). Limited water taxi service to nearby islands like Saltspring is also availible out of Sturdies Bay and Montague Harbour.\n\nDaily, regularly scheduled floatplane service is offered from Downtown Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport through [[Seair Seaplanes]] to Montague Harbour. There is regularly scheduled floatplane service from Seattle daily through [[Kenmore Air]], either through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Kenmore Air Harbor and Seattle Lake Union.\n\nOnce on the Island, most areas can be accessed by paved road, however some logging roads remain in use in the less traveled sections of the Island.\n\n== Parks ==\nGaliano is home to many popular public parks like Montague Harbour and Dionisio as well as privately owned parks such as Tapovan Peace Park.\n\n[[File:MontagueHarbourBoats.jpg|thumb|right|View from Shell Beach at Montague Harbour Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Orcas and Seals at Dionisio.jpg|thumb|Orcas and Seals at Dionisio Provincial Park]]\n\n*[[Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park]] is one of the most popular parks in the Gulf Islands.  It is unique for its Shell Beach, which is a west-facing beach with worn shells covering the whole expanse of the beach instead of sand. For thousands of years, it was the location of a midden used by Coast Salish people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=2014-01-23 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/galiano-island | ref={{sfnref | The Canadian Encyclopedia | 2014}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. Montague Harbour is popular with the recreational boating community; the harbour is often crowded with [[yacht]]s and [[sailboat]]s during the warmer months of June, July, and August.  The Park's mooring buoys are in limited supply and cannot be reserved, but the harbour is well sheltered if one chooses to anchor.  A marina with moorage, gas dock, several small stores, and a cafe (summer only) is located at the southern end of the harbour.  A public dock is near the marina.\n\n*[[Dionisio Point Provincial Park]] is a boat-access only, rugged natural park at the north end of the island with beautiful beaches that the local islanders call Coon Bay. Here you will find a unique shoreline with sandstone formations, a sandy beach for swimming, tidal pools, colourful wildflowers, and forests that fill this beautiful provincial park. \n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park] is Galiano's oldest wilderness park, established by community subscription in 1948. With {{convert|130|ha|acres|abbr=on}}, it extends far inland into virgin forest, as well having high cliffs and a long sandy beach.\n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/mount-galiano/ Mount Galiano] is Galiano\u2019s highest point. It rises 314 meters (1030 feet) above sea level. The top provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. \n\n*[http://biogaliano.org/2017/09/22/mount-sutil/ Sutil Mountain] in the southeastern part of the island is an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after [[Sutil (ship)|Capt. Galiano's flagship]].\n\n*[[Collinson Point Provincial Park]] is essentially the shoreline of Mount Galiano, and is important in protecting the marine life of the approaches to Active Pass.\n\n*[[Bodega Ridge Provincial Park]] consists of a ridge that rises over 240 metres above sea level, with views over many of the Gulf Islands' hundreds of islands and islets and beyond to the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula. High cliffs are home to raptors like peregrine falcons and bald eagles, as well as trees like [[Thuja plicata|cedars]] and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n*Tapovan Peace Park is a [[Tapovan]] of some 200 acres in the middle of the Island, dedicated to [[Sri Chinmoy]]. It features many hiking trails named by the word \"peace\", each in a different language, and a veritable stairway to heaven ascending the high cliff.\n\n*[https://www.crd.bc.ca/project/past-capital-projects-and-initiatives/matthews-point-management-plan Matthews Point Park] is a 25-hectare [[Capital Regional District]] Park that preserves over a kilometre of waterfront on [[Active Pass]], of which 300 metres are broad sandy beach. It was named after a pioneer family whose descendants in England later contributed towards the Park purchase. There is also a hiking loop along the clifftops.<ref>CRD, Matthews Point Management Plan https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/parks-pdf/matthews-point-management-plan-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=1c13f6ca_4</ref> It adjoins and is connected to [http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park].\n\n*The [http://conservancy.bc.ca/trincomali-nature-sanctuary/ Trincomali Nature Sanctuary] is an area of sheer cliffs that has been set aside by the [[Islands Trust]] for the preservation of [[Double-crested cormorants]] and [[Peregrine Falcons]], among other species.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment bodies that oversee the island include [[Government of Canada|Federal]], [[Politics of British Columbia|Provincial]] and the [[Capital Regional District]] as well as the Islands Trust whose mandate is to establish land-use bylaws to \"preserve and protect\" the island, most notably in terms of development. For most of the twentieth century roughly half of the land on Galiano was owned by the logging firm [[MacMillan Bloedel]]. As a result, Galiano was not as extensively developed as neighboring islands. When the firm sold its holdings on Galiano, debate about development issues sharpened, and the Islands Trust set minimum lot sizes to limit development.\n\nLocal elections are held every three years to determine who will be the island's two Trustees.\n\nThere is one Indian Reserve on the island, Galiano Indian Reserve No. 9, located at the northern tip of the island operating under Penelakut administration.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|33539|Galiano Indian Reserve 9}}</ref><ref>[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Reserve/Settlement/Village Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214525/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng |date=2012-05-15 }}</ref>.\n\n== Tourism ==\nDue to the minimal development of Galiano, tourism on the island has remained limited and sustainable. There are two proper hotels and several cabin resorts, but most accommodation comes in the form of Bed and Breakfasts, the Montague Provincial Park Campsite or holiday rentals. Activities on Galiano Island include hiking, boating, visiting art galleries, golfing and exploring beaches, as well as frequent musical events.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThe powerline [[HVDC Vancouver-Island]] crosses Galiano Island in southwestly direction as overhead powerline section, which ends at a cable terminal on [[Parker Island]].\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Brett Gaylor]]\n*[[Iona Campagnolo]]\n*[[Jane Rule]]\n*[[Audrey Thomas]]\n*[[Marie Clements]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:MontagueHarbourCliffside.jpg|Montague Harbour sunset\nFile:Mount Galiano 2.jpg|View from Mt.

Located on the west side of the [[Strait of Georgia]], the island is bordered by [[Mayne Island]] to the Southeast, [[Saltspring Island]] to the west and [[Valdes Island]] to the Northwest. Galiano is part of the [[Capital G, British Columbia|Capital Regional District Electoral Area G]], and has a permanent population of 1044 inhabitants as of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=DPL&Code1=590004&Geo2=CD&Code2=6204&Data=Count&SearchText=galiano&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, and designated places, 2016 census |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2008-05-11 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nGaliano takes its name from Spanish explorer [[Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano]], who explored the area in 1792,<ref>{{cite bcgnis|5236|Galiano Island}}</ref> (the island is twinned with his home city - [[Cabra, Spain|Cabra]] in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spanish province)|C\u00f3rdoba province]], [[Spain]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alcalagaliano.com/ |title=Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Dionisio Alcal\u00e1-Galiano - Inicio |publisher=Alcalagaliano.com |date= |access-date=2011-11-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228155404/http://www.alcalagaliano.com/ |archive-date=2011-12-28 |df= }}</ref>).  \n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Retrato del brigadier de la Real Arada Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano (ca. 1843) - An\u00f3nimo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dionisio Alcal\u00e1 Galiano]] (1760-1805)]]\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, Galiano Island was long inhabited by aboriginal people from the [[Penelakut]] First Nation as well as other [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] peoples, who used the island as a summer fishing colony. [[Midden pits]] at Montague Harbour suggest at least 3000 years of habitation<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/history.htm|title=Galiano Island: A Historical Sketch|website=galianomuseum.ca|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>. In the late 1770s, before Europeans had even arrived in the area, the small pox epidemic reached the Coast Salish region, killing as much as 30% of region's original population<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/smallpox|title=Smallpox in Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Subsequent outbreaks would reduce the First Nations population even further over the following century.\n\nIn 1792, Spanish navigator Dionisio Galiano was dispatched by the Spanish crown to seek out the rumoured [[Northwest Passage]]. After returning from Nootka sound, Galiano and his two vessels, ''[[Sutil (ship)|Sutil]]'' and ''Mexicana'', entered the Straight of Juan de Fuca later that year. While sailing near modern day Point Roberts, Galiano encountered the Britsh expedition led by Captain [[George Vancouver]]<ref>Kendrick, John (1990). ''The Voyage of'' Sutil ''and'' Mexicana'', 1792: The last Spanish exploration of the Northwest Coast of America''. Spokane, Washington: The Arthur H. Clark Company. pp. 43, 51\u201352, 208\u2013209. </ref>. The two exchanged maps and parted ways on friendly terms, despite the somewhat hostile  [[Nootka Crisis|relations between their mother countries]]. Galiano then proceeded to circumnavigate Vancouver Island, confirming it to indeed be an island, and returned to Mexico shortly after to report his findings. He would later die at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWhen news of the discovery of gold on the British Columbia mainland reached [[San Francisco]] in 1858, nearby [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] became an important port for miners on their way to the [[Fraser Canyon Gold Rush|Fraser Canyon gold fields]]. Due to increased interest and in the area, the Royal Navy hydrographer Captain [[George Henry Richards]] was tasked with mapping the area around Galiano Island in 1859, and decided to name the island in honour of the Spanish navigator who had visited the region 67 years prior<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn the early years of European settlement the island\u2019s primary industries were fishing and logging. Poor soil on the island limited the development of widespread agriculture found on other Gulf Islands, such as nearby Saltspring. Early settlement included a pioneer farming community on the shores of \u201cPlumper Pass\u201d (later renamed Active Pass). Other settlers, such as Scotty Georgeson (a Shetland Islander who married a Fraser Valley Sto:lo woman), also held land and had family on Galiano in this early period<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nBeginning in the 1870s a small number of Asian immigrants, particularly Japanese, also decided to settle the area for its abundance of fish stock and timber. These Japanese immigrants, primarily from [[Wakayama prefecture]], brought with them methods of charcoal production, who\u2019s evidence can still be found on the island today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/pit-kiln/|title=Japanese Charcoal Pit Kiln|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many of these Japanese settlers continued to operate salteries on the North end of the island until the outbreak of [[internment of Japanese Canadians|war with Japan]].\n\nFollowing confederation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871 and the subsequent the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, the nearby Lower Mainland exploded in population. By 1928 this had spilled over, and the small community on Galiano had grown large enough to construct the Galiano Community hall, which is still in use today<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianomuseum.ca/new/pages/2004020022.htm|title=Dance at the Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. In the 1960s logging rights for much of the island were given to [[MacMillan Bloedel]] for resource extraction<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://galianostory.com/OVERVIEW.HTM|title=The Story of Galiano Island: across thirty important years|last=Griffiths|first=Margaret|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Many environmentally conscious residents objected to the widespread logging, leading to many disputes including ''MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.vlex.com/vid/macmillan-v-galiano-island-681204801|title=Macmillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Galiano Island Trust Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Enviromentalism and the 1960s counter-culture continue to heavily influence the culture of the island to this day. In 2006 the riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands, to which Galiano is a part, elected Canada's first [[Green Party of Canada|Green]] member of parliament, [[Elizabeth May]].\n\nAs of the 21st century, the logging industry has all but halted on the island, replaced by industries such as tourism and a local art scene.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n[[File:Arbutus Tree (7743626674).jpg|thumb|left|[[Arbutus menziesii|Arbutus tree]] in Montague Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Roca Seta.JPG|thumb|Sandstone formation on the west coast of Galiano]]\n\nLocated on the western edge of the [[Salish Sea]], Galiano is a long, narrow island, {{convert|27.5|km|mi|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} in length and {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} at its narrowest point.\n\nMount Galiano is Galiano\u2019s highest point, rising 311 metres (1020 feet) above sea level. The summit provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. Just west of Mt. Galiano is Sutil Mountain, an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after Capt. Galiano's flagship. \n\nThe western coast of the island (facing [[Trincomali Channel]]) is characterized by its unique sandstone formations and caves. \n\n===Ecology===\n\nDue to its mild climate, Galiano Island is home to a large variety of animals and plants. In a major flight path for migrating birds, Galiano has hundreds of bird species,<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island Check List | website=iNaturalist.ca | date=2009-07-29 | url=https://inaturalist.ca/check_lists/288913-Galiano-Island-Check-List?iconic_taxon=3 | ref={{sfnref | iNaturalist.ca | 2009}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> such as [[bald eagle]]s, [[heron]]s and [[cormorant]]s. Off its shores are resident and transient populations of [[Killer whale|orca whales]], [[Harbor seal|seals]], [[Sea otter|otters]], [[Steller sea lion|sea lions]] as well as many other varieties of sea life. The island is also home to a large population of deer.\n\nMany native tree species such as [[arbutus menziesii|Arbutus trees]], [[Thuja plicata|western red cedar]] and [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coastal douglas fir]] thrive on the island and can be found in abundance. While most of the Island has been logged in the years since European settlement, limited old growth forests still exist, for example on the southern side Bluffs Park <ref>{{Cite report |url=https://galianoconservancy.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/final_report_complete.pdf|title=Galiano Island Landscape Classification and Up-close Workshop Series Final Report |first=Kate |last=Emmings |first2=Keith |last2=Erickson |date=June 2004 |publisher=Galiano Conservancy Association}}</ref>.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Galiano Island is classified as [[warm-summer Mediterranean climate|Warm-Summer Mediterranean (Csb)]] under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system which is characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Similar to the other [[Southern Gulf Islands|Gulf Islands]], the [[rain shadow]] effect of the [[Olympic Mountains|Olympic]] and [[Vancouver Island Ranges|Vancouver Island mountains]], and the moderating effects of the ocean, are the dominant influences on the climate of Galiano Island. The combined effects of low precipitation, warm temperatures, and high number of sunshine hours often result in an annual moisture deficit on Galiano Island from mid-June to early October. This deficit can often reach drought conditions in areas of recent clearcuts and can result in an extreme forest fire hazard in the summer months<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.islandstrustconservancy.ca/media/64549/itfmgmtplanvanillaleafland.pdf|title=Vanilla Leaf Land Nature Reserve (DL 58) Galiano Island Management Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Galiano Island]]\n|metric first = 1\n|single line = 1\n|Jan high C = 6.3\n|Feb high C = 8.1\n|Mar high C = 10.1\n|Apr high C = 13.0\n|May high C = 16.4\n|Jun high C = 19.4\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.8\n|Sep high C = 18.8\n|Oct high C = 13.9\n|Nov high C = 9.5\n|Dec high C = 6.6\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = 3.4\n|Feb mean C = 4.6\n|Mar mean C = 6.1\n|Apr mean C = 8.5\n|May mean C = 11.5\n|Jun mean C = 14.5\n|Jul mean C = 16.5\n|Aug mean C = 16.4\n|Sep mean C = 13.8\n|Oct mean C = 9.8\n|Nov mean C = 6.2\n|Dec mean C = 3.7\n|year mean C = 9.6\n|Jan low C = 0.5\n|Feb low C = 1.1\n|Mar low C = 2.1\n|Apr low C = 4.1\n|May low C = 6.7\n|Jun low C = 9.6\n|Jul low C = 11.2\n|Aug low C = 11.1\n|Sep low C = 8.9\n|Oct low C = 5.8\n|Nov low C = 2.9\n|Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 153\n|Feb precipitation mm = 112\n|Mar precipitation mm = 90\n|Apr precipitation mm = 59\n|May precipitation mm = 45\n|Jun precipitation mm = 36\n|Jul precipitation mm = 24\n|Aug precipitation mm = 29\n|Sep precipitation mm = 47\n|Oct precipitation mm = 98\n|Nov precipitation mm = 165\n|Dec precipitation mm = 162\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = climate-data.org\n}}\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Salish Orca at Sturdies Bay, Galiano Island.jpg|thumb|left|top|Sturdies Bay, the BC Ferries terminal]]\nGaliano Island is accessible by vehicle via the [[BC Ferries]] terminal at [[Sturdies Bay]], located on [[Active Pass]]. Vehicle and passenger ferry service runs from [[Tsawwassen ferry terminal|Tsawwassen]] ([[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]) on the mainland and [[Swartz Bay]] ([[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]) on Vancouver Island most days of the year. Additionally, there are numerous inter-island ferries that connect the Gulf Islands, which are scheduled less frequently.\n\nMoorage is available at several public wharves for boat traffic: Sturdies Bay, (walking distance to the Village), Montague Harbour, Whalers Bay and Retreat Cove. Private moorage is available at Montague Harbour Marina and the Galiano Oceanfront Inn (Sturdies Bay). Limited water taxi service to nearby islands like Saltspring is also availible out of Sturdies Bay and Montague Harbour.\n\nDaily, regularly scheduled floatplane service is offered from Downtown Vancouver and the Vancouver International Airport through [[Seair Seaplanes]] to Montague Harbour. There is regularly scheduled floatplane service from Seattle daily through [[Kenmore Air]], either through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Kenmore Air Harbor and Seattle Lake Union.\n\nOnce on the Island, most areas can be accessed by paved road, however some logging roads remain in use in the less traveled sections of the Island.\n\n== Parks ==\nGaliano is home to many popular public parks like Montague Harbour and Dionisio as well as privately owned parks such as Tapovan Peace Park.\n\n[[File:MontagueHarbourBoats.jpg|thumb|right|View from Shell Beach at Montague Harbour Provincial Park]]\n[[File:Orcas and Seals at Dionisio.jpg|thumb|Orcas and Seals at Dionisio Provincial Park]]\n\n*[[Montague Harbour Marine Provincial Park]] is one of the most popular parks in the Gulf Islands.  It is unique for its Shell Beach, which is a west-facing beach with worn shells covering the whole expanse of the beach instead of sand. For thousands of years, it was the location of a midden used by Coast Salish people.<ref>{{cite web | title=Galiano Island | website=The Canadian Encyclopedia | date=2014-01-23 | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/galiano-island | ref={{sfnref | The Canadian Encyclopedia | 2014}} | access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>. Montague Harbour is popular with the recreational boating community; the harbour is often crowded with [[yacht]]s and [[sailboat]]s during the warmer months of June, July, and August.  The Park's mooring buoys are in limited supply and cannot be reserved, but the harbour is well sheltered if one chooses to anchor.  A marina with moorage, gas dock, several small stores, and a cafe (summer only) is located at the southern end of the harbour.  A public dock is near the marina.\n\n*[[Dionisio Point Provincial Park]] is a boat-access only, rugged natural park at the north end of the island with beautiful beaches that the local islanders call Coon Bay. Here you will find a unique shoreline with sandstone formations, a sandy beach for swimming, tidal pools, colourful wildflowers, and forests that fill this beautiful provincial park. \n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park] is Galiano's oldest wilderness park, established by community subscription in 1948. With {{convert|130|ha|acres|abbr=on}}, it extends far inland into virgin forest, as well having high cliffs and a long sandy beach.\n\n*[http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/mount-galiano/ Mount Galiano] is Galiano\u2019s highest point. It rises 314 meters (1030 feet) above sea level. The top provides hikers with views over the Gulf Islands, the U.S. San Juan Islands and the distant mainland mountains as well. \n\n*[http://biogaliano.org/2017/09/22/mount-sutil/ Sutil Mountain] in the southeastern part of the island is an Ecological Reserve 290 meters (951 feet) above sea level, named after [[Sutil (ship)|Capt. Galiano's flagship]].\n\n*[[Collinson Point Provincial Park]] is essentially the shoreline of Mount Galiano, and is important in protecting the marine life of the approaches to Active Pass.\n\n*[[Bodega Ridge Provincial Park]] consists of a ridge that rises over 240 metres above sea level, with views over many of the Gulf Islands' hundreds of islands and islets and beyond to the mountains of the Olympic Peninsula. High cliffs are home to raptors like peregrine falcons and bald eagles, as well as trees like [[Thuja plicata|cedars]] and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n*Tapovan Peace Park is a [[Tapovan]] of some 200 acres in the middle of the Island, dedicated to [[Sri Chinmoy]]. It features many hiking trails named by the word \"peace\", each in a different language, and a veritable stairway to heaven ascending the high cliff.\n\n*[https://www.crd.bc.ca/project/past-capital-projects-and-initiatives/matthews-point-management-plan Matthews Point Park] is a 25-hectare [[Capital Regional District]] Park that preserves over a kilometre of waterfront on [[Active Pass]], of which 300 metres are broad sandy beach. It was named after a pioneer family whose descendants in England later contributed towards the Park purchase. There is also a hiking loop along the clifftops.<ref>CRD, Matthews Point Management Plan https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/parks-pdf/matthews-point-management-plan-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=1c13f6ca_4</ref> It adjoins and is connected to [http://www.galianoclub.org/club-programs/parks/bluffs-park/ Bluffs Park].\n\n*The [http://conservancy.bc.ca/trincomali-nature-sanctuary/ Trincomali Nature Sanctuary] is an area of sheer cliffs that has been set aside by the [[Islands Trust]] for the preservation of [[Double-crested cormorants]] and [[Peregrine Falcons]], among other species.\n\n==Government==\nGovernment bodies that oversee the island include [[Government of Canada|Federal]], [[Politics of British Columbia|Provincial]] and the [[Capital Regional District]] as well as the Islands Trust whose mandate is to establish land-use bylaws to \"preserve and protect\" the island, most notably in terms of development. For most of the twentieth century roughly half of the land on Galiano was owned by the logging firm [[MacMillan Bloedel]]. As a result, Galiano was not as extensively developed as neighboring islands. When the firm sold its holdings on Galiano, debate about development issues sharpened, and the Islands Trust set minimum lot sizes to limit development.\n\nLocal elections are held every three years to determine who will be the island's two Trustees.\n\nThere is one Indian Reserve on the island, Galiano Indian Reserve No. 9, located at the northern tip of the island operating under Penelakut administration.<ref>{{cite bcgnis|33539|Galiano Indian Reserve 9}}</ref><ref>[http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Reserve/Settlement/Village Detail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515214525/http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/fnp/Main/Search/RVDetail.aspx?RESERVE_NUMBER=06825&lang=eng |date=2012-05-15 }}</ref>.\n\n== Tourism ==\nDue to the minimal development of Galiano, tourism on the island has remained limited and sustainable.

From an old [[Virginia]] family, as a young man Coles was a neighbor and associate of presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], as well as secretary to President [[James Madison]] (1810 to 1815).\n\nAn anti-slavery advocate throughout his adult life, Coles inherited a plantation and slaves but eventually left Virginia for the [[Illinois Territory]] in order to set his slaves free. He [[Manumission|manumitted]] 19 slaves in 1819, and acquired land for them. In [[Illinois]], he twice led political campaigns that prevented the legitimization of slavery in the new state. Coles corresponded with and advised both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to free their slaves. In his final years in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], he helped shape early historians' views of the presidents' republican ideals.\n\n==Early life and education==\nColes was born on December 15, 1786, at [[Enniscorthy (Virginia)|Enniscorthy]],<ref name=\"virginia1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Delisted_Resources/002-0028_Enniscorthy_nomination_Delisted.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places : Enniscorthy |publisher=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu01428.xml |title=A Guide to the Enniscorthy Collection 1926-1970 Enniscorthy, Collection, 1926-1970 11606 |publisher=Ead.lib.virginia.edu |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/92456/news-top-buyer-enniscorthy-owner-waits-tyco-axe |title=Top buyer: Enniscorthy owner waits for Tyco axe &#124; The Hook - Charlottesville's weekly newspaper, news magazine |publisher=Readthehook.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> a plantation in central Virginia's [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] on the [[Hardware River]], a tributary of the [[James River]].

However, for years he received no reasonable offers, and so continued to operate it through an overseer.

The fear of appearing presumptuous distresses me, and would deter me from venturing thus to call your attention to a subject of such magnitude, and so beset with difficulties, as that of a general emancipation of the Slaves of Virginia, had I not the highest opinion of your goodness and liberality, in not only excusing me for the liberty I take, but in justly appreciating my motives in doing so.\n\nI will not enter on the right which man has to enslave his Brother man, nor upon the moral and political effects of Slavery on individuals or on Society; because these things are better understood by you than by me. My object is to entreat and beseech you to exert your knowledge and influence, in devising, and getting into operation, some plan for the gradual emancipation of Slavery. This difficult task could be less exceptionably, and more successfully performed by the revered Fathers of all our political and social blessings, than by any succeeding statesmen; and would seem to come with peculiar propriety and force from those whose valor wisdom and virtue have done so much in meliorating the condition of mankind. And it is a duty, as I conceive, that devolves particularly on you, from your known philosophical and enlarged view of subjects, and from the principles you have professed and practiced through a long and useful life, preeminently distinguished, as well by being foremost in establishing on the broadest basis the rights of man, and the liberty and independence of your Country, as in being throughout honored with the most important trusts by your fellow-citizens, whose confidence and love you have carried with you into the shades of old age and retirement. In the calm of this retirement you might, most beneficially to society, and with much addition to your own fame, avail yourself of that love and confidence to put into complete practice those hallowed principles contained in that renowned Declaration, of which you were the immortal author, and on which we bottomed our right to resist oppression, and establish our freedom and independence.\n\nI hope that the fear of failing, at this time, will have no influence in preventing you from employing your pen to eradicate this most degrading feature of British Colonial policy, which is still permitted to exist, notwithstanding its repugnance as well to the principles of our revolution as to our free Institutions. For however highly prized and influential your opinions may now be, they will be still much more so when you shall have been snatched from us by the course of nature. If therefore your attempt should now fail to rectify this unfortunate evil\u2014an evil most injurious both to the oppressed and to the oppressor\u2014at some future day when your memory will be consecrated by a grateful posterity, what influence, irresistible influence will the opinions and writings of Thomas Jefferson have on all questions connected with the rights of man, and of that policy which will be the creed of your disciples. Permit me then, my dear Sir, again to intreat you to exert your great powers of mind and influence, and to employ some of your present leisure, in devising a mode to liberate one half of our Fellowbeings from an ignominious bondage to the other; either by making an immediate attempt to put in train a plan to commence this goodly work, or to leave human Nature the invaluable Testament\u2014which you are so capable of doing\u2014how best to establish its rights: So that the weight of your opinion may be on the side of emancipation when that question shall be agitated, and that it will be sooner or later is most certain\u2014That it may be soon is my most ardent prayer\u2014that it will be rests with you.\n\nI will only add, as an excuse for the liberty I take in addressing you on this subject, which is so particularly interesting to me; that from the time I was capable of reflecting on the nature of political society, and of the rights appertaining to Man, I have not only been principled against Slavery, but have had feelings so repugnant to it, as to decide me not to hold them; which decision has forced me to leave my native state, and with it all my relations and friends. This I hope will be deemed by you some excuse for the liberty of this intrusion, of which I gladly avail myself to assure you of the very great respect and esteem with which I am, my dear Sir, your every sincere and devoted friend\n\n:''Edward Coles''\n\n----\n\n<br /><center>''Thomas Jefferson'' to ''Edward Coles''<br />August 25, 1814<br />Monticello</center><br />\nDEAR SIR,-- Your favour of July 31, was duly received, and was read with peculiar pleasure. The sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and time has only served to give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear not much serious willingness to relieve them & ourselves from our present condition of moral & political reprobation. From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the work of themselves & their fathers, few minds have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life has been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprize on their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of the principles which they invoked for themselves. In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the oldest, ablest, & most respected members, and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in the debate; but he was denounced as an enemy of his country, & was treated with the grossest indecorum. From an early stage of our revolution other & more distant duties were assigned to me, so that from that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and I may say till I returned to reside at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast, & had become as it were the vital spirit of every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my intercourse with them, since my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress I had hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear; and I have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds; or by the bloody process of St Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our Country, and offering asylum & arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over. As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that as emancipation of those born after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after a given age. This would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labour & substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce. For men probably of any color, but of this color we know, brought from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves, and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising young. In the meantime they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them. Their amalgamation with the other color produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent. I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector \"trementibus aequo humeris et inutile ferruncingi.\" No, I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors & perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to its consummation. It shall have all my prayers, & these are the only weapons of an old man. But in the meantime are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from all ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, & be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope then, my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass. That, on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian; insinuate & inculcate it softly but steadily, through the medium of writing and conversation; associate others in your labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on and press the proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment. It is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed, which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the English parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us. And you will be supported by the religious precept, \"be not weary in well-doing.\" That your success may be as speedy & complete, as it will be of honorable & immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently and sincerely pray as I assure you of my great friendship and respect. <br />\n::''Thomas Jefferson''\n<br/>\n----\n<br />\n<center>''Edward Coles'' to ''Thomas Jefferson''<br />September 26, 1814<br />Washington</center>\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must be permitted again to trouble you, my dear Sir, to return my grateful thanks for the respectful and friendly attention shown to my letter in your answer of the 25th ulto. Your favorable reception of sentiments not generally avowed if felt by our Countrymen, but which have ever been so inseparably interwoven with my opinions and feelings as to become as it were the rudder that shapes my course even against a strong tide of interest and of local partialities, could not but be in the highest degree gratifying to me. And your interesting and highly prized letter, conveying them to me in such flattering terms, would have been called forth my acknowledgments before this but for its having been forwarded to me to the Springs, and from thence it was again returned here before I received it, which was only a few days since.\n\nYour indulgent treatment encourages me to add\u2014that I feel very sensibly the force of your remarks on the impropriety of yielding to my repugnancies in abandoning my property in Slaves and my native State. I certainly should never have been inclined to yield to them if I had supposed myself capable of being instrumental in bringing about a liberation, or that I could by my example meliorate the condition of these oppressed people. If I could be convinced of being in the slightest degree useful in doing either, it would afford me very great happiness, and the more so as it would enable me to gratify many partialities by remaining in Virginia. But never having flattered myself with the hope of being able to contribute to either, I have long since determined, and should, but for my bad health ere this, have removed, carrying along with me those who had been my Slaves, to the Country North West of the river Ohio.\n\nYour prayers I trust will not only be heard with indulgence in Heaven, but with influence on earth. But I cannot agree with you that they are the only weapons of one at your age, nor that the difficult work of cleansing the escutchion of Virginia of the foul stain of slavery can best be done by the young. To effect so great and difficult an object great and extensive powers both of mind and influence are required, which can never be possessed in so great a degree by the young as by the old. And among the few of the former who might unite the disposition with the re-quisite capacity, they are too often led by ambitious views to go with the current of popular feeing, rather than to mark out a course for themselves, where they might be buffetted by the waves of opposition; and indeed it is feared these waves would in this case be too strong to be effectually resisted, by any but those who had gained by a previous course of useful employment the firmest footing in the confidence and attachment of their Country. It is with them, therefore, I am persuaded, that the subject of emancipation must originate; for they are the only persons who have it in their power effectually to arouse and enlighten the public sentiment, which in matters of this kind ought not to be expected to lead but to be led; nor ought it to be wondered at that there should prevail a degree of apathy with the general mass of mankind, where a mere passive principle of right has to contend against the weighty influence of habit and interest. On such a question there will always exist in society a kind of vis inertia, to arouse and overcome which require a strong impulse, which can only be given by those who have acquired a great weight of character, and on whom there devolves in this case a most solemn obligation. It was under these impressions that I looked to you, my dear sir, as the first of our aged worthies, to awaken our fellow Citizens from their infatuation to a proper sense of Justice and to the true interest of their country, and by proposing a system for the gradual emancipation of our Slaves, at once to form a rallying point for its friends, who enlightened by your wisdom and experience, and supported and encouraged by your sanction and patronage, might look forward to a propitious and happy result. Your time of life I had not considered as an obstacle to the undertaking. Doctor Franklin, to whom, by the way, Pennsylvania owes her early riddance of the evils of Slavery, was as actively and as usefully employed on as arduous duties after he had past your age as he had ever been at any period of his life.\n\nWith apologizing for having give you so much trouble on this subject, and again repeating my thanks for the respectful and flattering attention you have been pleased to pay to it, I renew the assurances of the great respect and regard which makes me most sincerely\n\n:Yours\n\n:''Edward Coles'' \n{{refend}}\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Illinois===\nIn the fall of 1817, Coles sold his plantation to his eldest brother Walter, having declined James Monroe's request that he continue as the new President's private secretary. Instead, Coles embarked on a second reconnaissance mission to the Northwest Territories (1818). He bought land in the [[American Bottom]] in Illinois Territory. Coles also participated in the Illinois Constitutional Convention at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] after Indiana became a state. Coles worked with [[Baptist]] [[John Mason Peck]], [[Methodist]] [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]], [[Quaker]] [[James Lemen]], and publisher [[Hooper Warren]] to successfully oppose a faction that wanted to legitimize slavery in the new territory's constitution.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.38-39</ref><ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] pp.10-11</ref><ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] pp. 62-74</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc14.html |title=Chapter 14: Second Trip to Illinois |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes then returned to Virginia, planning to display his deep moral objections to slavery and finally [[manumit]] the slaves he inherited from his father after leaving the Commonwealth. In late March 1819, having collected the final payment from Walter, Edward Coles was ready to move to the Illinois Territory. President Monroe had appointed him Register of Lands for the new territory, with an office at [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nColes sent his trusted slave (and travel companion during his previous Northwest Territory trips) Ralph Crawford with wagons and 16 other slaves (total 6 adults and 11 children) ahead on the [[Great Wagon Road]] north to Pennsylvania. To the derision of many family and friends, Coles had let the slaves ride on ahead, none of them knowing his plans to free them at that time.<ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] p.12</ref> Coles traveled separately. They met at [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], where the party boarded a pair of [[flatboats]] and began a water-bound journey: floating on the [[Monongahela River]]  north to Pittsburgh, then west along the [[Ohio River]] toward Illinois.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 59-64.</ref> Coles selected a point west of Pittsburgh to announce to his slaves their immediate freedom and also his plan to provide land to each head of a family.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 64-70.</ref><ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.47-49</ref><ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.110</ref> Coles captured the scene in an autobiographical piece written some 25 years later.<ref>Document:\"The Emancipation of the Slaves of Edward Coles.\" October 1827, Folder 21, Box 3, Coles Family Papers, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</ref> Decades later, the river emancipation became the subject of a mural in the first floor (south hall) of the [[Illinois State Capitol]].<ref>https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evr7069mets.xml</ref>\n\nThe Coles party arrived in Edwardsville, early in May 1819, and Coles began his service as Register of Lands.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.44-46</ref> He also completed the manumission process by purchasing land so as to give each freed head of family {{convert|160|acre|km2}}.<ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.259</ref> Coles also provided employment and other ongoing support for those he had freed.

Browne]] (the eventual candidate of the [[Ninian Edwards]] faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, \"As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc19.html |title=Chapter 19: Governor Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes\u2019 inaugural address included a clear call for the end of slavery in Illinois and revision of the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Code]], as well as advocated internal improvements (especially a canal link to the Great Lakes) and aid to agriculture and education.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.238-239</ref> Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles\u2019 bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent).<ref>Document:\"The Shaw-Hansen Election Contest.\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society.

After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, and legislators (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1819]] keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians ([[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] and [[Roberts Vaux]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/edwardcoles.html |title=Narrative of the Life of Edward Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> The 18-month political struggle used committees in each county as well as traveling preachers.\n\nOn August 2, 1824, Illinois voters rejected the pro-slavery convention referendum (as well as re-elected anti-slavery U.S. representative [[Daniel Pope Cook]]). However, by year's end pro-slavery legislators refused to approve Coles' appointment of his anti-slavery friend Morris Birkbeck as secretary of state. Furthermore, lieutenant governor Adolphus Hubbard attempted to wrest the governorship away from Coles during his trip to Virginia in late 1825, causing additional confusion, although Hubbard also lost the gubernatorial election the next year to [[Ninian Edwards]] (the state Constitution also included a provision modelled on Virginia's which precluded governors from running for reelection).<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 141-143</ref> Finally, a lawsuit that political opponents in [[Madison County, Illinois]] brought against Coles for failing to pay a slave tax on his freed slaves years earlier took several more years, including shenanigans by pro-slavery judge [[Samuel McRoberts]], before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] ruled such payment unnecessary.<ref>citing Alvord, Governor Edward Coles (Illinois State Historical Society, 1920) at pp. 210-213.</ref> Coles' valedictory speech as governor in December 1826 reminded legislators of his previous speeches urging them to abolish slavery and its remnants (especially heritability) in the new state, as well as to finance a canal to the Great Lakes watershed and a penitentiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc25.html |title=Chapter 25 : The Result |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as governor expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, where his mother had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit family and friends and to search for a wife. His friend [[Daniel Pope Cook]] was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, and legislators had selected their pro-slavery speaker [[John McLean (Illinois politician)|John McLean]] to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing [[Elias Kent Kane]] and [[John McCracken Robinson]] to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]]) and Sidney Breese (a [[Jacksonian Democrat]]), Coles polled a distant third.<ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] p.271</ref> He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 146-149</ref> Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state credit, sales proved slow.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc26.html |title=Chapter 26: The Rest of a Life |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Back to Virginia===\nWorried about his unmarried status and increasing partisanship, Coles decided to leave Illinois shortly after his election loss. He made another trip to Virginia, which was involved in its own debate over slavery after [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion. After Turner's execution, Coles wrote [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] urging emancipation and colonization to prevent further disasters, stressing that slavery restricted Virginia's economic development.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 152-153.</ref> At year's end, while visiting James and Dolley Madison at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], Madison confided in Coles his wish to manumit his own slaves and asked Coles about his experiences as he tried to find the right way to accomplish this while still  providing for Dolley as his widow. However, Madison died in 1836 without freeing any of his slaves which were left in a will to his wife Dolley.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp.161-162</ref><ref>Document:Edward Coles to James Madison, January 8, 1832, folder 30, box 1, E. Coles Papers, Princeton University Library.</ref>\n\n==Later life in Philadelphia==\nColes moved to Philadelphia in 1832, gratified by its active social and intellectual life, as well as slavery's absence. At age 46, Coles married prominent socialite Sally Logan Roberts (1809 to 1883) on November 28, 1833. The couple had three children: Mary Coles, Edward Coles, Jr., and Roberts Coles. Sally Coles inherited significant property upon her father's death, but it (and much of Coles' own fortune) was devastated by the [[Panic of 1837]]. Furthermore, his family's renovated Enniscorthy plantation burned down in 1839, and his elder brother Isaac only survived the disasters by two years.<ref name=\"virginia1\"/> Coles's last public appointment was in 1841, when he served on a committee investigating the U.S. Bank, which ultimately led to the resignation of his friend Nicholas Biddle.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\"/> Coles unsuccessfully sought political appointments from his Virginia classmates who had become high federal officials, [[John Tyler]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Still, rental income from real estate investments (widely spread geographically) kept the growing family financially comfortable. Coles and his young family travelled often to visit his extended family and properties in Virginia and Washington, D.C., as well as Illinois and later [[Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey]].\n\nHowever, Coles never resumed his political career, uncomfortable with the new party system. Nonetheless, he rejoiced when [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom he remembered as a young Illinois lawyer, was elected President. The elderly ex-governor briefly met the newly elected president on his journey to Washington.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 201-203</ref> Coles had also publicly taken exception to Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' characterization of slavery's history in Illinois during the [[Kansas-Nebraska]] debate of 1854.\n\nColes turned to history during his later years. He was recognized as one of the few remaining men with close personal knowledge of both Madison and Jefferson, and burnished their reputations as champions of the republican ideals that had also motivated Coles during his entire life.<ref>Document:Guasco, Suzanne Cooper. \"Managing Memory: The Cultivation of Elite Authority in Jacksonian America.\" paper presentation, annual conference, Society for Historians of the Early American Republic (SHEAR) Conference, Buffalo, NY July 20\u201323, 2000.</ref> Coles had lobbied both Jefferson and Madison (and later [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]) to free their slaves. Coles was surprised when Madison failed to do so, only later learning that lawyer [[Robert Taylor (congressman)|Robert Taylor]] had persuaded the former President to leave emancipation instructions for his widow, whose father had gone bankrupt after freeing his slaves many years earlier. Dolley, with other personal economic priorities (especially a son addicted to gambling), freed no slaves upon her death in 1849.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 160-166.</ref> Coles also wrote about the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. However, most of Coles' own papers from Illinois were destroyed in a fire in 1852 while his friend [[John Mason Peck]] was writing a history of the new state.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, p. 172, 177.</ref> Coles also assisted Virginia historians [[William Cabell Rives]] and [[Hugh Blair Grigsby]], and New Yorker [[Henry S.

After the Civil War began, he enlisted in the Green Mountain Greys and was elected captain. Roberts Coles died (as did the other Confederate captain) during the [[Battle of Roanoke Island]], February 8, 1862.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofedwardsville.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={4732FD7F-1ADF-44BD-8F45-2291524800E4} |title=Governors of Edwardsville - City of Edwardsville, Illinois |publisher=Cityofedwardsville.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 191-199.</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Edward Coles grave.jpg|thumb|Coles' grave]]\nColes died, aged eighty one years, in his home (1303 Spruce Street in [[Philadelphia]]) on July 7, 1868.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] p.248</ref> While devastated by his younger son's death fighting for the Confederates, Coles lived to see slavery abolished through President Lincoln's issuing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] as well as ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Coles also lived to see his elder son and namesake, Edward Coles, Jr., marry Elizabeth (Bessie) Mason Campbell, relative of anti-slavery founding father [[George Mason]] (descendant of his younger brother [[Thomson Mason]]) on February 25, 1868. Edward Coles Jr. became a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, and a long-time vestry member of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]], which still displays a plaque honoring his service on the south wall inside the nave.\n\nThe Coles family grave at [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in west Philadelphia includes the final resting places of the former governor, his wife Sally, as well as their three children. His daughter Mary Coles (who never married) and Caroline Sanford founded the Church Training school for Deaconesses in Philadelphia in 1891, and served as its president as well as a faculty member.<ref>Mary Sudman Donovan, A Different Call: Women's Ministries in the Episcopal Church 1850-1920, pp. 115 (Wilton, Connecticut: Morehouse-Harlow 1986</ref> The school generally graduated 7 to 10 pupils per year (the highest number in residence was 30 in 1912-13), which were in great demand and served not only in hospitals and parishes in Pennsylvania, but throughout the United States and missions abroad.

Edward Jr. and Bessie Coles were also buried at the new family gravesite.\n\n==Legacy==\nColes was among the very few slaveholders who manumitted his slaves entirely as a testament to the [[Republicanism|republican]] ethos that was at the heart of the American Revolution and enlightenment.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://usslave.blogspot.com/2011/12/virginian-named-edward-coles.html |title=US Slave: The Virginian Named Edward Coles |publisher=Usslave.blogspot.com |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> He is also noteworthy for his attempts to pressure Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Jefferson Randolph to work to end of slavery in Virginia and for James Madison to free his slaves.\n\n[[Coles County, Illinois]] was named for him,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

From an old [[Virginia]] family, as a young man Coles was a neighbor and associate of presidents [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], as well as secretary to President [[James Madison]] (1810 to 1815).\n\nAn anti-slavery advocate throughout his adult life, Coles inherited a plantation and slaves but eventually left Virginia for the [[Illinois Territory]] in order to set his slaves free. He [[Manumission|manumitted]] 19 slaves in 1819, and acquired land for them. In [[Illinois]], he twice led political campaigns that prevented the legitimization of slavery in the new state. Coles corresponded with and advised both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to free their slaves. In his final years in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], he helped shape early historians' views of the presidents' republican ideals.\n\n==Early life and education==\nColes was born on December 15, 1786, at [[Enniscorthy (Virginia)|Enniscorthy]],<ref name=\"virginia1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/registers/Counties/Delisted_Resources/002-0028_Enniscorthy_nomination_Delisted.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places : Enniscorthy |publisher=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=uva-sc/viu01428.xml |title=A Guide to the Enniscorthy Collection 1926-1970 Enniscorthy, Collection, 1926-1970 11606 |publisher=Ead.lib.virginia.edu |date=2000-04-01 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readthehook.com/92456/news-top-buyer-enniscorthy-owner-waits-tyco-axe |title=Top buyer: Enniscorthy owner waits for Tyco axe &#124; The Hook - Charlottesville's weekly newspaper, news magazine |publisher=Readthehook.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> a plantation in central Virginia's [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] on the [[Hardware River]], a tributary of the [[James River]].

However, for years he received no reasonable offers, and so continued to operate it through an overseer.

His great-grandfather, Walter Coles, had been a customs officer in Ireland who moved to what became [[Richmond, Virginia]] and made his fortune as a merchant. His grandfather John had been one of the petitioners requesting that Richmond be recognized as a new town, and continued to develop the family's business and social ties through marriage to the youngest daughter of [[Quaker]] merchant Isaac Winston. Edward Coles's father John (a/k/a John II) developed Enniscorthy from a hunting camp into a profitable farm, and continued the family's business and social success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc2.html |title=Chapter 2: Virginia |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nEdward Coles' maternal grandfather was born in [[Bermuda]], and related to Virginia jurist [[St. George Tucker]].

[[James Monroe]] owned [[Ash Lawn-Highland]] plantation on the other side of Green Mountain for 24 years (until forced to sell it in 1825 due to financial problems), and offered young Coles use of his library, although the relationship with this family was more distant since Monroe split his time at [[Oak Hill (James Monroe House)|Oak Hill]] plantation in [[Loudoun County]].\n\nIsaac managed and ultimately inherited Enniscorthy, subject to a life estate held by his mother (who died in 1826).

The fear of appearing presumptuous distresses me, and would deter me from venturing thus to call your attention to a subject of such magnitude, and so beset with difficulties, as that of a general emancipation of the Slaves of Virginia, had I not the highest opinion of your goodness and liberality, in not only excusing me for the liberty I take, but in justly appreciating my motives in doing so.\n\nI will not enter on the right which man has to enslave his Brother man, nor upon the moral and political effects of Slavery on individuals or on Society; because these things are better understood by you than by me. My object is to entreat and beseech you to exert your knowledge and influence, in devising, and getting into operation, some plan for the gradual emancipation of Slavery. This difficult task could be less exceptionably, and more successfully performed by the revered Fathers of all our political and social blessings, than by any succeeding statesmen; and would seem to come with peculiar propriety and force from those whose valor wisdom and virtue have done so much in meliorating the condition of mankind. And it is a duty, as I conceive, that devolves particularly on you, from your known philosophical and enlarged view of subjects, and from the principles you have professed and practiced through a long and useful life, preeminently distinguished, as well by being foremost in establishing on the broadest basis the rights of man, and the liberty and independence of your Country, as in being throughout honored with the most important trusts by your fellow-citizens, whose confidence and love you have carried with you into the shades of old age and retirement. In the calm of this retirement you might, most beneficially to society, and with much addition to your own fame, avail yourself of that love and confidence to put into complete practice those hallowed principles contained in that renowned Declaration, of which you were the immortal author, and on which we bottomed our right to resist oppression, and establish our freedom and independence.\n\nI hope that the fear of failing, at this time, will have no influence in preventing you from employing your pen to eradicate this most degrading feature of British Colonial policy, which is still permitted to exist, notwithstanding its repugnance as well to the principles of our revolution as to our free Institutions. For however highly prized and influential your opinions may now be, they will be still much more so when you shall have been snatched from us by the course of nature. If therefore your attempt should now fail to rectify this unfortunate evil\u2014an evil most injurious both to the oppressed and to the oppressor\u2014at some future day when your memory will be consecrated by a grateful posterity, what influence, irresistible influence will the opinions and writings of Thomas Jefferson have on all questions connected with the rights of man, and of that policy which will be the creed of your disciples. Permit me then, my dear Sir, again to intreat you to exert your great powers of mind and influence, and to employ some of your present leisure, in devising a mode to liberate one half of our Fellowbeings from an ignominious bondage to the other; either by making an immediate attempt to put in train a plan to commence this goodly work, or to leave human Nature the invaluable Testament\u2014which you are so capable of doing\u2014how best to establish its rights: So that the weight of your opinion may be on the side of emancipation when that question shall be agitated, and that it will be sooner or later is most certain\u2014That it may be soon is my most ardent prayer\u2014that it will be rests with you.\n\nI will only add, as an excuse for the liberty I take in addressing you on this subject, which is so particularly interesting to me; that from the time I was capable of reflecting on the nature of political society, and of the rights appertaining to Man, I have not only been principled against Slavery, but have had feelings so repugnant to it, as to decide me not to hold them; which decision has forced me to leave my native state, and with it all my relations and friends. This I hope will be deemed by you some excuse for the liberty of this intrusion, of which I gladly avail myself to assure you of the very great respect and esteem with which I am, my dear Sir, your every sincere and devoted friend\n\n:''Edward Coles''\n\n----\n\n<br /><center>''Thomas Jefferson'' to ''Edward Coles''<br />August 25, 1814<br />Monticello</center><br />\nDEAR SIR,-- Your favour of July 31, was duly received, and was read with peculiar pleasure. The sentiments breathed through the whole do honor to both the head and heart of the writer. Mine on the subject of slavery of negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and time has only served to give them stronger root. The love of justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these people, and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a single effort, nay I fear not much serious willingness to relieve them & ourselves from our present condition of moral & political reprobation. From those of the former generation who were in the fulness of age when I came into public life, which was while our controversy with England was on paper only, I soon saw that nothing was to be hoped. Nursed and educated in the daily habit of seeing the degraded condition, both bodily and mental, of those unfortunate beings, not reflecting that that degradation was very much the work of themselves & their fathers, few minds have yet doubted but that they were as legitimate subjects of property as their horses and cattle. The quiet and monotonous course of colonial life has been disturbed by no alarm, and little reflection on the value of liberty. And when alarm was taken at an enterprize on their own, it was not easy to carry them to the whole length of the principles which they invoked for themselves. In the first or second session of the Legislature after I became a member, I drew to this subject the attention of Col. Bland, one of the oldest, ablest, & most respected members, and he undertook to move for certain moderate extensions of the protection of the laws to these people. I seconded his motion, and, as a younger member, was more spared in the debate; but he was denounced as an enemy of his country, & was treated with the grossest indecorum. From an early stage of our revolution other & more distant duties were assigned to me, so that from that time till my return from Europe in 1789, and I may say till I returned to reside at home in 1809, I had little opportunity of knowing the progress of public sentiment here on this subject. I had always hoped that the younger generation receiving their early impressions after the flame of liberty had been kindled in every breast, & had become as it were the vital spirit of every American, that the generous temperament of youth, analogous to the motion of their blood, and above the suggestions of avarice, would have sympathized with oppression wherever found, and proved their love of liberty beyond their own share of it. But my intercourse with them, since my return has not been sufficient to ascertain that they had made towards this point the progress I had hoped. Your solitary but welcome voice is the first which has brought this sound to my ear; and I have considered the general silence which prevails on this subject as indicating an apathy unfavorable to every hope. Yet the hour of emancipation is advancing, in the march of time. It will come; and whether brought on by the generous energy of our own minds; or by the bloody process of St Domingo, excited and conducted by the power of our present enemy, if once stationed permanently within our Country, and offering asylum & arms to the oppressed, is a leaf of our history not yet turned over. As to the method by which this difficult work is to be effected, if permitted to be done by ourselves, I have seen no proposition so expedient on the whole, as that as emancipation of those born after a given day, and of their education and expatriation after a given age. This would give time for a gradual extinction of that species of labour & substitution of another, and lessen the severity of the shock which an operation so fundamental cannot fail to produce. For men probably of any color, but of this color we know, brought from their infancy without necessity for thought or forecast, are by their habits rendered as incapable as children of taking care of themselves, and are extinguished promptly wherever industry is necessary for raising young. In the meantime they are pests in society by their idleness, and the depredations to which this leads them. Their amalgamation with the other color produces a degradation to which no lover of his country, no lover of excellence in the human character can innocently consent. I am sensible of the partialities with which you have looked towards me as the person who should undertake this salutary but arduous work. But this, my dear sir, is like bidding old Priam to buckle the armour of Hector \"trementibus aequo humeris et inutile ferruncingi.\" No, I have overlived the generation with which mutual labors & perils begat mutual confidence and influence. This enterprise is for the young; for those who can follow it up, and bear it through to its consummation. It shall have all my prayers, & these are the only weapons of an old man. But in the meantime are you right in abandoning this property, and your country with it? I think not. My opinion has ever been that, until more can be done for them, we should endeavor, with those whom fortune has thrown on our hands, to feed and clothe them well, protect them from all ill usage, require such reasonable labor only as is performed voluntarily by freemen, & be led by no repugnancies to abdicate them, and our duties to them. The laws do not permit us to turn them loose, if that were for their good: and to commute them for other property is to commit them to those whose usage of them we cannot control. I hope then, my dear sir, you will reconcile yourself to your country and its unfortunate condition; that you will not lessen its stock of sound disposition by withdrawing your portion from the mass. That, on the contrary you will come forward in the public councils, become the missionary of this doctrine truly Christian; insinuate & inculcate it softly but steadily, through the medium of writing and conversation; associate others in your labors, and when the phalanx is formed, bring on and press the proposition perseveringly until its accomplishment. It is an encouraging observation that no good measure was ever proposed, which, if duly pursued, failed to prevail in the end. We have proof of this in the history of the endeavors in the English parliament to suppress that very trade which brought this evil on us. And you will be supported by the religious precept, \"be not weary in well-doing.\" That your success may be as speedy & complete, as it will be of honorable & immortal consolation to yourself, I shall as fervently and sincerely pray as I assure you of my great friendship and respect. <br />\n::''Thomas Jefferson''\n<br/>\n----\n<br />\n<center>''Edward Coles'' to ''Thomas Jefferson''<br />September 26, 1814<br />Washington</center>\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must be permitted again to trouble you, my dear Sir, to return my grateful thanks for the respectful and friendly attention shown to my letter in your answer of the 25th ulto. Your favorable reception of sentiments not generally avowed if felt by our Countrymen, but which have ever been so inseparably interwoven with my opinions and feelings as to become as it were the rudder that shapes my course even against a strong tide of interest and of local partialities, could not but be in the highest degree gratifying to me. And your interesting and highly prized letter, conveying them to me in such flattering terms, would have been called forth my acknowledgments before this but for its having been forwarded to me to the Springs, and from thence it was again returned here before I received it, which was only a few days since.\n\nYour indulgent treatment encourages me to add\u2014that I feel very sensibly the force of your remarks on the impropriety of yielding to my repugnancies in abandoning my property in Slaves and my native State. I certainly should never have been inclined to yield to them if I had supposed myself capable of being instrumental in bringing about a liberation, or that I could by my example meliorate the condition of these oppressed people. If I could be convinced of being in the slightest degree useful in doing either, it would afford me very great happiness, and the more so as it would enable me to gratify many partialities by remaining in Virginia. But never having flattered myself with the hope of being able to contribute to either, I have long since determined, and should, but for my bad health ere this, have removed, carrying along with me those who had been my Slaves, to the Country North West of the river Ohio.\n\nYour prayers I trust will not only be heard with indulgence in Heaven, but with influence on earth. But I cannot agree with you that they are the only weapons of one at your age, nor that the difficult work of cleansing the escutchion of Virginia of the foul stain of slavery can best be done by the young. To effect so great and difficult an object great and extensive powers both of mind and influence are required, which can never be possessed in so great a degree by the young as by the old. And among the few of the former who might unite the disposition with the re-quisite capacity, they are too often led by ambitious views to go with the current of popular feeing, rather than to mark out a course for themselves, where they might be buffetted by the waves of opposition; and indeed it is feared these waves would in this case be too strong to be effectually resisted, by any but those who had gained by a previous course of useful employment the firmest footing in the confidence and attachment of their Country. It is with them, therefore, I am persuaded, that the subject of emancipation must originate; for they are the only persons who have it in their power effectually to arouse and enlighten the public sentiment, which in matters of this kind ought not to be expected to lead but to be led; nor ought it to be wondered at that there should prevail a degree of apathy with the general mass of mankind, where a mere passive principle of right has to contend against the weighty influence of habit and interest. On such a question there will always exist in society a kind of vis inertia, to arouse and overcome which require a strong impulse, which can only be given by those who have acquired a great weight of character, and on whom there devolves in this case a most solemn obligation. It was under these impressions that I looked to you, my dear sir, as the first of our aged worthies, to awaken our fellow Citizens from their infatuation to a proper sense of Justice and to the true interest of their country, and by proposing a system for the gradual emancipation of our Slaves, at once to form a rallying point for its friends, who enlightened by your wisdom and experience, and supported and encouraged by your sanction and patronage, might look forward to a propitious and happy result. Your time of life I had not considered as an obstacle to the undertaking. Doctor Franklin, to whom, by the way, Pennsylvania owes her early riddance of the evils of Slavery, was as actively and as usefully employed on as arduous duties after he had past your age as he had ever been at any period of his life.\n\nWith apologizing for having give you so much trouble on this subject, and again repeating my thanks for the respectful and flattering attention you have been pleased to pay to it, I renew the assurances of the great respect and regard which makes me most sincerely\n\n:Yours\n\n:''Edward Coles'' \n{{refend}}\n|}\n</div>\n\n===Illinois===\nIn the fall of 1817, Coles sold his plantation to his eldest brother Walter, having declined James Monroe's request that he continue as the new President's private secretary. Instead, Coles embarked on a second reconnaissance mission to the Northwest Territories (1818). He bought land in the [[American Bottom]] in Illinois Territory. Coles also participated in the Illinois Constitutional Convention at [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]] after Indiana became a state. Coles worked with [[Baptist]] [[John Mason Peck]], [[Methodist]] [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]], [[Quaker]] [[James Lemen]], and publisher [[Hooper Warren]] to successfully oppose a faction that wanted to legitimize slavery in the new territory's constitution.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.38-39</ref><ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] pp.10-11</ref><ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] pp. 62-74</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc14.html |title=Chapter 14: Second Trip to Illinois |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes then returned to Virginia, planning to display his deep moral objections to slavery and finally [[manumit]] the slaves he inherited from his father after leaving the Commonwealth. In late March 1819, having collected the final payment from Walter, Edward Coles was ready to move to the Illinois Territory. President Monroe had appointed him Register of Lands for the new territory, with an office at [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]].<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nColes sent his trusted slave (and travel companion during his previous Northwest Territory trips) Ralph Crawford with wagons and 16 other slaves (total 6 adults and 11 children) ahead on the [[Great Wagon Road]] north to Pennsylvania. To the derision of many family and friends, Coles had let the slaves ride on ahead, none of them knowing his plans to free them at that time.<ref>[[#Ress2006|Ress, 2006]] p.12</ref> Coles traveled separately. They met at [[Brownsville, Pennsylvania]], where the party boarded a pair of [[flatboats]] and began a water-bound journey: floating on the [[Monongahela River]]  north to Pittsburgh, then west along the [[Ohio River]] toward Illinois.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 59-64.</ref> Coles selected a point west of Pittsburgh to announce to his slaves their immediate freedom and also his plan to provide land to each head of a family.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp. 64-70.</ref><ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.47-49</ref><ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.110</ref> Coles captured the scene in an autobiographical piece written some 25 years later.<ref>Document:\"The Emancipation of the Slaves of Edward Coles.\" October 1827, Folder 21, Box 3, Coles Family Papers, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.</ref> Decades later, the river emancipation became the subject of a mural in the first floor (south hall) of the [[Illinois State Capitol]].<ref>https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evr7069mets.xml</ref>\n\nThe Coles party arrived in Edwardsville, early in May 1819, and Coles began his service as Register of Lands.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.44-46</ref> He also completed the manumission process by purchasing land so as to give each freed head of family {{convert|160|acre|km2}}.<ref>[[#Bateman1918|Bateman, 1918]] p.259</ref> Coles also provided employment and other ongoing support for those he had freed.

Browne]] (the eventual candidate of the [[Ninian Edwards]] faction) and militia commander James B. Moore. Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from bilious fever. He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, \"As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc19.html |title=Chapter 19: Governor Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nColes\u2019 inaugural address included a clear call for the end of slavery in Illinois and revision of the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Code]], as well as advocated internal improvements (especially a canal link to the Great Lakes) and aid to agriculture and education.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] pp.238-239</ref> Slavery was a very important topic at the time, because that first state constitution only permitted current practices using slave labor in the salines (salt evaporation factories) through 1825. A proslavery faction had hoped to eliminate the first constitution's anti-slavery clause and transform Illinois into a slave state like Missouri. Coles\u2019 bold call for an end to slavery stiffened their resolve and led to a rancorous legislative effort which began with the Shaw-Hansen Affair (concerning whether to seat a pro-slavery candidate backed by voters who came from Missouri, or his anti-slavery opponent).<ref>Document:\"The Shaw-Hansen Election Contest.\" Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society.

After the bill passed, Coles committed his total pay as governor ($4000) to defeat the referendum, and led a committee of anti-slavery citizens, religious leaders, and legislators (who committed another $1000). The aristocratic, awkward Virginian and his allies then dispelled a plethora of false economic arguments spread by slavery proponents, while in the aftermath of the [[Panic of 1819]] keeping secret their printing help from much-reviled Philadelphians ([[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]] and [[Roberts Vaux]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/edwardcoles.html |title=Narrative of the Life of Edward Coles |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2010-08-22 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref> The 18-month political struggle used committees in each county as well as traveling preachers.\n\nOn August 2, 1824, Illinois voters rejected the pro-slavery convention referendum (as well as re-elected anti-slavery U.S. representative [[Daniel Pope Cook]]). However, by year's end pro-slavery legislators refused to approve Coles' appointment of his anti-slavery friend Morris Birkbeck as secretary of state. Furthermore, lieutenant governor Adolphus Hubbard attempted to wrest the governorship away from Coles during his trip to Virginia in late 1825, causing additional confusion, although Hubbard also lost the gubernatorial election the next year to [[Ninian Edwards]] (the state Constitution also included a provision modelled on Virginia's which precluded governors from running for reelection).<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 141-143</ref> Finally, a lawsuit that political opponents in [[Madison County, Illinois]] brought against Coles for failing to pay a slave tax on his freed slaves years earlier took several more years, including shenanigans by pro-slavery judge [[Samuel McRoberts]], before the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] ruled such payment unnecessary.<ref>citing Alvord, Governor Edward Coles (Illinois State Historical Society, 1920) at pp. 210-213.</ref> Coles' valedictory speech as governor in December 1826 reminded legislators of his previous speeches urging them to abolish slavery and its remnants (especially heritability) in the new state, as well as to finance a canal to the Great Lakes watershed and a penitentiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc25.html |title=Chapter 25 : The Result |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\nAfter his term as governor expired, Coles returned briefly to Virginia, where his mother had died that spring. Coles then returned to his farm outside of Edwardsville. He focused on agricultural and business pursuits, between continued trips to Virginia and Philadelphia to visit family and friends and to search for a wife. His friend [[Daniel Pope Cook]] was defeated by a proslavery opponent in 1826, and legislators had selected their pro-slavery speaker [[John McLean (Illinois politician)|John McLean]] to fill unexpired U.S. Senate terms in 1824 and 1829 (voters ultimately electing [[Elias Kent Kane]] and [[John McCracken Robinson]] to those seats). Coles made his last run for public office in 1831. As candidate for Congress, running against eight candidates including pro-slavery Democrats Joseph Duncan (allied with Treasury Secretary [[William H. Crawford]]) and Sidney Breese (a [[Jacksonian Democrat]]), Coles polled a distant third.<ref>[[#Norton1920|Norton, 1920]] p.271</ref> He had been out of public view for some years, and refused to align himself with any political party. Instead, Coles campaigned on his successful term as governor, proclaimed his association with the founding fathers, and criticized the Jacksonian platform. Still, Coles felt devastated by the political defeat, and moved back east.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 146-149</ref> Nonetheless, in 1835, Illinois legislators authorized Coles to sell bonds to finance his canal project, but since they also refused to back the bonds with state credit, sales proved slow.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poemsforfree.com/cc26.html |title=Chapter 26: The Rest of a Life |publisher=Poemsforfree.com |date=2007-11-06 |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref>\n\n===Back to Virginia===\nWorried about his unmarried status and increasing partisanship, Coles decided to leave Illinois shortly after his election loss. He made another trip to Virginia, which was involved in its own debate over slavery after [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion. After Turner's execution, Coles wrote [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] urging emancipation and colonization to prevent further disasters, stressing that slavery restricted Virginia's economic development.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth pp. 152-153.</ref> At year's end, while visiting James and Dolley Madison at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], Madison confided in Coles his wish to manumit his own slaves and asked Coles about his experiences as he tried to find the right way to accomplish this while still  providing for Dolley as his widow. However, Madison died in 1836 without freeing any of his slaves which were left in a will to his wife Dolley.<ref>[[#Leichtle2011|Leichtle, 2011]] pp.161-162</ref><ref>Document:Edward Coles to James Madison, January 8, 1832, folder 30, box 1, E. Coles Papers, Princeton University Library.</ref>\n\n==Later life in Philadelphia==\nColes moved to Philadelphia in 1832, gratified by its active social and intellectual life, as well as slavery's absence. At age 46, Coles married prominent socialite Sally Logan Roberts (1809 to 1883) on November 28, 1833. The couple had three children: Mary Coles, Edward Coles, Jr., and Roberts Coles. Sally Coles inherited significant property upon her father's death, but it (and much of Coles' own fortune) was devastated by the [[Panic of 1837]]. Furthermore, his family's renovated Enniscorthy plantation burned down in 1839, and his elder brother Isaac only survived the disasters by two years.<ref name=\"virginia1\"/> Coles's last public appointment was in 1841, when he served on a committee investigating the U.S. Bank, which ultimately led to the resignation of his friend Nicholas Biddle.<ref name=\"poemsforfree2007\"/> Coles unsuccessfully sought political appointments from his Virginia classmates who had become high federal officials, [[John Tyler]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Still, rental income from real estate investments (widely spread geographically) kept the growing family financially comfortable. Coles and his young family travelled often to visit his extended family and properties in Virginia and Washington, D.C., as well as Illinois and later [[Schooley's Mountain, New Jersey]].\n\nHowever, Coles never resumed his political career, uncomfortable with the new party system. Nonetheless, he rejoiced when [[Abraham Lincoln]], whom he remembered as a young Illinois lawyer, was elected President. The elderly ex-governor briefly met the newly elected president on his journey to Washington.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 201-203</ref> Coles had also publicly taken exception to Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' characterization of slavery's history in Illinois during the [[Kansas-Nebraska]] debate of 1854.\n\nColes turned to history during his later years. He was recognized as one of the few remaining men with close personal knowledge of both Madison and Jefferson, and burnished their reputations as champions of the republican ideals that had also motivated Coles during his entire life.<ref>Document:Guasco, Suzanne Cooper. \"Managing Memory: The Cultivation of Elite Authority in Jacksonian America.\" paper presentation, annual conference, Society for Historians of the Early American Republic (SHEAR) Conference, Buffalo, NY July 20\u201323, 2000.</ref> Coles had lobbied both Jefferson and Madison (and later [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]) to free their slaves. Coles was surprised when Madison failed to do so, only later learning that lawyer [[Robert Taylor (congressman)|Robert Taylor]] had persuaded the former President to leave emancipation instructions for his widow, whose father had gone bankrupt after freeing his slaves many years earlier. Dolley, with other personal economic priorities (especially a son addicted to gambling), freed no slaves upon her death in 1849.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 160-166.</ref> Coles also wrote about the [[Northwest Ordinance]]. However, most of Coles' own papers from Illinois were destroyed in a fire in 1852 while his friend [[John Mason Peck]] was writing a history of the new state.<ref>Leichtle and Carveth, p. 172, 177.</ref> Coles also assisted Virginia historians [[William Cabell Rives]] and [[Hugh Blair Grigsby]], and New Yorker [[Henry S.

After the Civil War began, he enlisted in the Green Mountain Greys and was elected captain. Roberts Coles died (as did the other Confederate captain) during the [[Battle of Roanoke Island]], February 8, 1862.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofedwardsville.com/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={4732FD7F-1ADF-44BD-8F45-2291524800E4} |title=Governors of Edwardsville - City of Edwardsville, Illinois |publisher=Cityofedwardsville.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-11}}</ref><ref>Leichtle and Carveth, pp. 191-199.</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Edward Coles grave.jpg|thumb|Coles' grave]]\nColes died, aged eighty one years, in his home (1303 Spruce Street in [[Philadelphia]]) on July 7, 1868.<ref>[[#Washburne1882|Washburne, 1882]] p.248</ref> While devastated by his younger son's death fighting for the Confederates, Coles lived to see slavery abolished through President Lincoln's issuing the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] as well as ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]]. Coles also lived to see his elder son and namesake, Edward Coles, Jr., marry Elizabeth (Bessie) Mason Campbell, relative of anti-slavery founding father [[George Mason]] (descendant of his younger brother [[Thomson Mason]]) on February 25, 1868. Edward Coles Jr. became a prominent lawyer in Philadelphia, and a long-time vestry member of [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]], which still displays a plaque honoring his service on the south wall inside the nave.\n\nThe Coles family grave at [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in west Philadelphia includes the final resting places of the former governor, his wife Sally, as well as their three children. His daughter Mary Coles (who never married) and Caroline Sanford founded the Church Training school for Deaconesses in Philadelphia in 1891, and served as its president as well as a faculty member.<ref>Mary Sudman Donovan, A Different Call: Women's Ministries in the Episcopal Church 1850-1920, pp. 115 (Wilton, Connecticut: Morehouse-Harlow 1986</ref> The school generally graduated 7 to 10 pupils per year (the highest number in residence was 30 in 1912-13), which were in great demand and served not only in hospitals and parishes in Pennsylvania, but throughout the United States and missions abroad.

Some of these words were created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cacha\u00e7a was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate ''[[grappa]]''. There are more than two thousand words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate.<ref name=\"Cavalcante, Messias Soares 2011\"/> Some of these nicknames are: ''abre-cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' (heart-opener), ''\u00e1gua-benta'' (holy water), ''bafo-de-tigre'' (tiger breath), and ''limpa-olho'' (eye-wash).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |title=Cacha\u00e7a Nicknames &#124; The Almanac of Yum |publisher=Almanacofyum.wordpress.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102161608/http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Difference from rum ==\n\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas used the by-products of sugar, [[molasses]] and scummings as the raw material for the production of alcoholic spirits.

Accessed 1 June 2009.</ref>\n\nThere are very important regions in Brazil where fine [[pot still]] cacha\u00e7a is produced such as Ch\u00e3 Grande in [[Pernambuco]] state, Salinas in [[Minas Gerais]] state, [[Paraty]] in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state, Monte Alegre do Sul in [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] state and Aba\u00edra in [[Bahia]] state. Nowadays, producers of cacha\u00e7a can be found in most Brazilian regions and in 2011 there were over 40,000 of them.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\n== Synonyms ==\nFor more than four centuries of history, cacha\u00e7a has accumulated synonyms and creative nicknames coined by the Brazilian people. Some of these words were created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cacha\u00e7a was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate ''[[grappa]]''. There are more than two thousand words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate.<ref name=\"Cavalcante, Messias Soares 2011\"/> Some of these nicknames are: ''abre-cora\u00e7\u00e3o'' (heart-opener), ''\u00e1gua-benta'' (holy water), ''bafo-de-tigre'' (tiger breath), and ''limpa-olho'' (eye-wash).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |title=Cacha\u00e7a Nicknames &#124; The Almanac of Yum |publisher=Almanacofyum.wordpress.com |date=2012-03-28 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102161608/http://almanacofyum.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/cachaca-nicknames/ |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Difference from rum ==\n\nIn the beginning of the seventeenth century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas used the by-products of sugar, [[molasses]] and scummings as the raw material for the production of alcoholic spirits. The resulting beverage was known by several names: in British colonies, it was named ''rum;'' in France, ''tafia;'' in Spain, ''aguardiente de ca\u00f1a;'' and in Portugal (Brazil), ''aguardente da terra'', ''aguardente de cana'' and later ''cacha\u00e7a''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nThe major difference between cacha\u00e7a and [[rum]] is that rum is usually made from [[molasses]], a by-product after a refinery boils the cane juice to extract as much sugar crystal as possible, while cacha\u00e7a is made from fresh sugarcane juice, fermented and distilled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cocktailtimes.com/dictionary/cachacas.shtml |title=> Dictionary |publisher=Cocktail Times |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref> Some rums&mdash;in particular the ''[[rhum agricole]]'' of the [[French Caribbean]]&mdash;are also made by the latter process. Cacha\u00e7a is also known as '''Brazilian rum'''.<ref name=\"multipla\"/>\n\nIn the United States, cacha\u00e7a is recognized as a type of rum and distinctive Brazilian product after an agreement was signed in 2013 with Brazil in which it will drop the usage of the term Brazilian rum.<ref>{{cite web|last=Colitt |first=Raymond |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-09/brazil-u-s-move-to-boost-cachaca-tennessee-whiskey-trade-1-.html |title= Brazil, U.S. Move to Boost Cachaca, Tennessee Whiskey Trade |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-02-25/pdf/2013-04242.pdf |title=TTB Amends the Distilled Spirits Identity Regulations to Recognize \"Cacha\u00e7a\" as a Type of Rum and Distinctive Product of Brazil |publisher=gpo.gov |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Liquor|Drink|Brazil}}\n* [[Clairin]]\n* [[Cocktails with cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of brands of Cacha\u00e7a]]\n* [[List of Brazilian drinks]]\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cacha\u00e7a}}\n* [http://www.cnn.folderpark.net/ O \u00c1lbum Virtual de R\u00f3tulos de Garrafas de Cacha\u00e7a na Net]\u2014Web site dedicated to cacha\u00e7a labels.

A few years later they moved into Virivka. There Valentine came to know and love the world of nature. During his childhood he liked to gather blackberries and raspberries, to mushroom and to fish. He was very obedient and smart child. When Valentine was a little boy, his father died in the war. He was the only child in the family, so he lived just with his mother. Later she became the most important figure in his poems.\nValentine graduated from primary school in Virivka. Then he was studying in Naraiiw and Velykoyablunivka. In 1954 he went to Zhytomyr Pedagogical University at the Faculty of Philology. Later he was studying journalism in [[Kyiv]]. His first article was published in the magazine \u201cKolhospna pratsya\u201d. He was working as a newspaper editor for almost 10 years. Valentine was also leading the Regional Literary Borys Ten Association.\n\n== Poems ==\nHe started to write in school magazines.  In 1966 he published his first collection of poems called \u201cKeys\u201c. In this collection he was trying to find something personal and special. His works were about the high destiny of man, the greatness of self-sacrifice for others and the loyalty to homeland. At the same time the writer was thinking about the beauty and the complicacy of life.\nThe second collection of poems was published in 1968 and was called \u201cOnce mother had a dream about the cherry tree\u201d. It showed the proficiency and experience of the writer. In this collection he wrote about his mother. She was the greatest love in his life. In general, the poems were permeated with lyricism. \nValentine Hrabovsky published about 15 books. There were his poems, translations, art articles. The works of the later period were basically historical (\u201cVolodymyr\u201d, \u201cGaydamak\u2019s mother\u201d etc.) \nHe was also interested in the environmental problems and the problem of the environmental soul. He saw not only the beautiful nature but also the tragic consequences of the war, [[Chernobyl disaster]] and he described that in his poems. The remarkable thing is that the important social problems didn\u2019t reduce the amount of lyric feelings in his works. \nIn 1999 Valentine published the collection called \u201cMystery of Zhytomyr\u2019s pictures\u201d, where he described the wonderful nature.\n\n== Translations ==\nValentin Hrabovsky was a professional translator. He translated the works of [[Adam Bernard Mickiewicz]], [[Alexandr Pushkin]], Olizar Gustav, Max Tank and others. These translations were published in the book which was called \"Conversation with the stone\". In his translations Valentine gave the vivid description of the characters, their mode of life, manners and tastes. His knowledge of human nature is broad. He could reproduce the same emotions and feelings as in the original works. He used to say that he wished to describe men and women as they really were.\n\n== Death ==\nValentine Hrabovsky was very popular among ordinary people as well as by well-known writers. He was very kind and sympathetic. The writer was working with young creative people and supported the talented youth. He died on December 24, 2004 at the age of 67.

He was a brother of [[Alexander Orbeliani]] and a cousin of [[Grigol Orbeliani]], fellow Romanticist poets. He studied at the Tiflis nobility school and enrolled into the [[St. Petersburg]] [[Page Corps]] which he did not graduate from and returned to homeland to lead, in 1832, a failed coup attempt against Russian rule in 1832. The conspirators planned to invite the Russian officials in the [[Caucasus]] to a grand ball where they would be given the choice of death or surrender. After the collapse of this plot, Orbeliani was arrested and sentenced to death, but reprieved and exiled to [[Kaluga]]. The abortive uprising and relatively mild punishment that followed forced many conspirators to see the independent past as irremediably lost and to reconcile themselves with the [[Russian autocracy]], transforming their laments for the lost past and the fall of the native dynasty into Romanticist poetry. In 1838, Orbeliani joined the Russian military service and served in the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] [[Dragoon]] regiment. Most of his military career was spent in the struggle against the rebellious mountainous tribes during the [[Caucasus War]]. He was placed in command of the Georgian [[Grenadier]] Regiment in 1855 and promoted to major general in 1860. Between 1858 and 1863, he carried out various administrative and military duties in the [[North Caucasus]], including being commander in the restive districts of [[Kabarda]] and [[Terek Oblast|Terek]]. Later in his career, he served as a member of peasants\u2019 council and worked as an arbitrator.\n\nLike his elder brother Alexander\u2019s, his poetry is obsessed with the destruction of the Georgian monarchy at the end of the 18th century, and the poet seeks console in a Christian patience. His best poetry is dominated by the sacred image of Georgian Christianity \u2014 [[Grapevine cross]] of [[St. Nino]].<ref>[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', p. 143.

He was placed in command of the Georgian [[Grenadier]] Regiment in 1855 and promoted to major general in 1860. Between 1858 and 1863, he carried out various administrative and military duties in the [[North Caucasus]], including being commander in the restive districts of [[Kabarda]] and [[Terek Oblast|Terek]]. Later in his career, he served as a member of peasants\u2019 council and worked as an arbitrator.\n\nLike his elder brother Alexander\u2019s, his poetry is obsessed with the destruction of the Georgian monarchy at the end of the 18th century, and the poet seeks console in a Christian patience. His best poetry is dominated by the sacred image of Georgian Christianity \u2014 [[Grapevine cross]] of [[St. Nino]].<ref>[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', p. 143.

The trumpet group :D ranges from the [[piccolo trumpet]] with the highest [[Register (music)|register]] in the brass family, to the [[bass trumpet]], which is pitched one octave below the standard B-flat or C Trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500&nbsp;BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.petrouska.com/historyofthetrumpet.htm\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608095025/http://www.petrouska.com/historyofthetrumpet.htm\n|url-status=dead\n|archivedate=2008-06-08\n|title=History of the Trumpet (According to the ''New Harvard Dictionary of Music'')\n|publisher=petrouska.com\n|accessdate=2014-12-17\n}}\n</ref> Trumpets are used in [[art music]] styles, for instance in [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s, and [[jazz]] ensembles, as well as in [[popular music]]. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's [[embouchure]]), producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a [[standing wave]] vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of [[brass]] tubing, usually bent twice into a [[rectangle|rounded rectangular]] shape.<ref>[[Clint McLaughlin]], ''The No Nonsense Trumpet From A-Z'' (Dallas, Texas: Trumpet College, 1995), 7\u201310.</ref>\n\nThere are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B{{music|flat}} (a [[transposing instrument]]), having a tubing length of about {{convert|1.48|m|abbr=on}}. Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) [[brass instrument valve|valves]] in order to change their [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1\u20132 combination. Most trumpets have valves of the [[piston valve|piston]] type, while some have the [[rotary valve|rotary]] type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a ''trumpet player'' or ''trumpeter''.<ref name=\"elisa1\">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary for the modern trumpet player|last=Elisa.|first=Koehler|isbn=9780810886582|location=Lanham, Maryland|oclc=904281337|date = March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word \"trumpet\" was first used in the late 14th century.<ref name=\"etymonline1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=trumpet |title=Trumpet |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote=}}</ref> The word came from Old French \"''trompette''\", which is a diminutive of ''trompe''.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> The word \"trump\", meaning \"trumpet,\" was first used in English in 1300.

The [[natural trumpet]]s of this era consisted of a single coiled tube without valves and therefore could only produce the notes of a single overtone series. Changing keys required the player to change [[Crook (music)|crooks]] of the instrument.<ref name=\"bbtrumpet1\"/>  The development of the upper, \"[[Clarion (instrument)|clarino]]\" register by specialist trumpeters\u2014notably [[Cesare Bendinelli]]\u2014would lend itself well to the [[Baroque]] era, also known as the \"Golden Age of the natural trumpet.\" During this period, a vast body of music was written for virtuoso trumpeters. The art was revived in the mid-20th century and natural trumpet playing is again a thriving art around the world. Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.<ref>John Wallace and Alexander McGrattan, ''The Trumpet'', Yale Musical Instrument Series (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2011): 239. {{ISBN|978-0-300-11230-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe melody-dominated [[homophony]] of the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] wrote in 1844:\n<blockquote>\nNotwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to [[Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], every composer&nbsp;\u2013 not excepting [[Mozart]]&nbsp;\u2013 persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae.<ref>[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz, Hector]] (1844). ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation|Treatise on modern Instrumentation and Orchestration]]''. [[Edwin F. Kalmus]], NY, 1948.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Trumpet valve bypass.svg|thumb|Trumpet valve bypass (depressed)]]\n\nThe trumpet is constructed of [[brass]] tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.dsokids.com/2001/dso.asp?PageID=162\n|title=Trumpet, Brass Instrument\n|publisher=dsokids.com\n|accessdate=2008-05-03\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref> As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through closed lips, producing a \"buzzing\" sound into the [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] and starting a [[standing wave]] vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] from a range of [[overtone]]s or [[harmonics]] by changing the lip [[aperture]] and tension (known as the [[embouchure]]).\n\nThe mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable environment for the lips' vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the [[timbre]] or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.\n\n[[Image:Bb trumpet in parts.jpg|thumb|left|B{{music|flat}} trumpet, disassembled]]\n\nModern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) [[piston valve]]s, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (two [[semitone]]s), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). When a fourth valve is present, as with some [[piccolo trumpet]]s, it usually lowers the pitch a [[perfect fourth]] (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of [[classical music]]. For more information about the different types of valves, see [[Brass instrument valves]].\n\nThe pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises it. To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slide, [[Renold Schilke]] designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall response.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bloch |first=Dr. Colin |url=http://www.dallasmusic.org/schilke/Tunable%20Bell%20Trumpets.html |title=The Bell-Tuned Trumpet |date=August 1978 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225212331/http://www.dallasmusic.org/schilke/Tunable%20Bell%20Trumpets.html |archivedate=25 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA trumpet becomes a [[closed tube]] when the player presses it to the lips; therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible.<ref>D. J. Blaikley, \"How a Trumpet Is Made. I. The Natural Trumpet and Horn\", ''The Musical Times'', January 1, 1910, p. 15.</ref> Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by ''throwing'' (extending) or retracting one or both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively.\n\n==Types==\nThe most common type is the B{{music|flat}} trumpet, but A, C, D, E{{music|flat}}, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B{{music|flat}} trumpet. [[Orchestral]] trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight, frequently playing music written for the A, B{{music|flat}}, D, E{{music|flat}}, E, or F trumpet on the C trumpet or B{{music|flat}} trumpet.\n\n[[File:Trumpet piccolo.jpg|thumb|left|Piccolo trumpet in B{{music|flat}}, with swappable [[leadpipe]]s to tune the instrument to B{{music|flat}} (shorter) or A (longer)]]\n\nThe smallest trumpets are referred to as [[piccolo trumpet]]s. The most common of these are built to play in both B{{music|flat}} and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B{{music|flat}} piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B{{music|flat}} trumpet. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and C are also manufactured, but are less common. Many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet, which requires a different sound production technique from the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and can limit endurance. Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three&nbsp;\u2014 the fourth valve lowers the pitch, usually by a fourth, to assist in the playing of lower notes and to create alternate fingerings that facilitate certain [[Trill (music)|trill]]s. [[Maurice Andr\u00e9]], [[H\u00e5kan Hardenberger]], [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]], and [[Wynton Marsalis]] are some well-known trumpet players known for their additional virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet.\n[[Image:Trumpet in c german.jpg|thumb|Trumpet in C with rotary valves]]\nTrumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s. Traditionally used in [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]], sopranos have featured both [[rotary valve]]s and [[piston valve]]s.\n\nThe bass trumpet is usually played by a [[trombone]] player, being at the same pitch.<ref name=\"elisa1\"/> Bass trumpet is played with a shallower trombone mouthpiece, and music for it is written in [[treble clef]]. The most common keys for bass trumpets are C and B{{music|flat}}. Both C and B{{music|flat}} bass trumpets are [[transposing instruments]] sounding an [[octave]] (C) or a major ninth (B{{music|flat}}) lower than written.\n\nThe historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in [[alta cappella]] wind bands. Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe. This single slide was rather awkward, as the entire corpus of the instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third. Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with [[shawm]]s in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466&nbsp;Hz. As no known instruments from this period survive, the details\u2014and even the existence\u2014of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of conjecture and debate among scholars.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/earlyj/2004/00000032/00000002/art00252\n |title       = IngentaConnect More about Renaissance slide trumpets: fact or fiction?\n |publisher   = ingentaconnect.com\n |accessdate  = 2008-05-03\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120922074227/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/earlyj/2004/00000032/00000002/art00252\n |archivedate = 2012-09-22\n}}\n</ref>\n\nSome slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|jstor=899543\n|title=JSTOR: Notes, Second Series\n|journal=Notes\n|volume=54\n|issue=2\n|pages=484\u2013485\n|year=1997\n|last1=Lessen\n|first1=Martin\n|doi=10.2307/899543\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[pocket trumpet]] is a compact B{{music|flat}} trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a tone quality and projection unique in the trumpet world: a warm sound and a voice-like articulation. Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and imprecise manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts. The jazz musician [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument.\n\nThe [[fanfare trumpet|herald trumpet]] has an elongated bell extending far in front of the player, allowing a standard length of tubing from which a flag may be hung; the instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and [[fanfares]].\n\n[[David Monette|Monette]] designed the [[flumpet]] in 1989 for jazz musician [[Art Farmer]]. It is a hybrid instrument with elements of trumpet and flugelhorn, sharing the three piston valve design and with a pitch of B{{music|flat}}.<ref name=\"fan2017\">{{cite book|last1=Koehler|first1=Elisa|title=Fanfares and Finesse: A Performer's Guide to Trumpet History and Literature|date=2014|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253011794|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=knrDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=flumpet+1989#v=onepage&q=flumpet%201989&f=false|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are also rotary-valve, or German, trumpets (which are commonly used in professional German and Austrian orchestras) as well as alto and [[Baroque trumpet]]s.\n\nAnother variant of the standard trumpet is the [[Vienna valve]] trumpet. Primarily used in Viennese brass ensembles and orchestras such as the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] and [[Mnozil Brass]].\n\nThe trumpet is often confused with its close relative the [[cornet]], which has a more [[cone (geometry)|conical]] tubing shape compared to the trumpet's more [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] tube. This, along with additional bends in the cornet's tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical. They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable. Another relative, the [[flugelhorn]], has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even richer tone. It is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes.\n\n==Playing==\n{{See also|Embouchure}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Fingering===<!--this section is linked to from [[Diminished triad chord]]-->\nOn any modern trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown. \"Open\" means all valves up, \"1\" means first valve, \"1\u20132\" means first and second valve simultaneously, and so on. The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, usually drops any of these pitches by a [[perfect fourth]] as well. Within each [[overtone]] series, the different pitches are attained by changing the [[embouchure]]. Standard fingerings above high C are the same as for the notes an octave below (C{{music|sharp}} is 1\u20132, D is 1, etc.)\n\n[[Image:Special-T trumpet overtone series.png|thumb|left|500px|A step = a [[Whole tone|tone]]; a half step = a [[semitone]]]]\n\nEach [[overtone]] series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone\u2014the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] of each overtone series cannot be produced except as a [[pedal tone]]. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is slightly flat relative to [[equal temperament]], and use of those fingerings is generally avoided.\n\nThe fingering schema arises from the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve \"1\" increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve \"2\" by one half step, and valve \"3\" by one and a half steps. This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space \"C\" can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2\u20133. Also, any note produced with 1\u20132 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 \u2013 each drops the pitch by {{frac|1|1|2}} steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1\u20133 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.\n\nIf you take the partials of the harmonic series that a modern Bb trumpet can play for each combination of valves pressed, some notes are in tune with [[12-tone equal temperament]] and some are not. The following tables show all notes from all partials from all valve combinations in order up to high C (C6). This often gives multiple fingerings for the same note and some notes that aren't usually useful.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align: center; display: inline-table;\"\n!

While most types of mutes do decrease the volume the instrument produces, as the name implies, the sound modification is typically the primary reason for their use. Types of mutes most commonly used to alter the sound of the instrument are: Straight Mutes, Harmon Mutes (aka \"Wah-Wah\" Mutes), Plunger Mutes, Bucket Mutes, and Cup Mutes. A description of their construction and sound quality are below:\n\n'''Straight Mute:''' Constructed of either aluminum, which produces a bright piercing sound, or stone lined with cardboard, which produces a stuffy sound.\n\n'''Harmon Mute:''' Constructed of aluminum and consists of two parts called the \"stem\" and the \"body\". The stem can be extended or removed to produce different timbres of sound. This mute is also called the \"Wah-Wah\" mute due to its distinctive sound created by the player placing their hand over the stem opening and waving it back and forth.\n\n'''Plunger Mute:''' Most often made of a rubber bathroom [[plunger]] without the stick. This is used to manipulate sound by the player holding it over the bell with their left hand.\n\n'''Bucket Mute''': Constructed from cardboard and cloth, this mute is clipped to the end of the bell and used to muffle the sound almost completely.\n\n'''Cup Mute:''' Also constructed of cardboard, this mute is shaped exactly like a straight mute but includes a cup at the end. In many models the cup is adjustable much like the stem on the harmon mute and produces a softer more muffled sound than a traditional straight mute.\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Hejnal-Warszawski.ogg|thumb|Sound of a trumpet \u2013 [[Warsaw|Warsaw Castle]], [[Poland]].]]\nThe standard trumpet range extends from the written F{{music|sharp}} immediately below [[Middle C]] up to about three [[octaves]] higher (F{{music|sharp}}3 \u2013 F{{music|sharp}}6). Traditional [[trumpet repertoire]] rarely calls for notes beyond this range, and the fingering tables of most method books peak at the [[Soprano C|high C]], two octaves above middle C.{{Contradict-inline|date=May 2016}}<!--Three paragraphs earlier \"Standard fingerings above high C\" are mentioned.--> Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Cat Anderson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Doc Severinsen]], and more recently [[Wayne Bergeron]], [[Thomas Gansch]], [[James Morrison (musician)|James Morrison]], [[Jon Faddis]] and [[Arturo Sandoval]]. It is also possible to produce [[pedal tone]]s below the low F{{music|sharp}}, which is a device occasionally employed in the contemporary repertoire for the instrument.\n\n==Extended technique==\nContemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques.\n\n'''[[Fluttertonguing|Flutter tonguing]]''': The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue to produce a 'growling like' tone. It is achieved as if one were rolling an ''R'' in the Spanish language. This technique is widely employed by composers like [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]].\n\n'''[[Growling (wind instruments)|Growling]]''': Simultaneously playing tone while using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula creating a distinct sound.  Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s.\n\n'''[[Double tonguing]]''': The player articulates using the syllables ta-ka ta-ka ta-ka\n\n'''Triple tonguing''': The same as double tonguing, but with the syllables ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka or ta-ka-ta ta-ka-ta.\n\n'''Doodle tongue''': The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word ''doodle''. This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo.\n\n'''[[Glissando]]''': Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension. Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique.\n\n'''[[Vibrato]]''': It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation. Composers can call for everything from fast, slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato.\n\n'''[[Pedal tone]]''': Composers have written for two-and-a-half octaves below the low F{{Music|sharp}}, which is at the bottom of the standard range. Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece. [[Claude Gordon]] assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines, that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke. The technique was pioneered by [[Bohumir Kryl]].<ref>Joseph Wheeler, \"Review: Edward H. Tarr, ''Die Trompete''\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 31, May, 1978, p. 167.</ref>\n\n'''[[Microtonal music|Microtones]]''': Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet's ability to play microtonally. Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note. The jazz musician [[Ibrahim Maalouf]] uses such a trumpet, invented by his father to make it possible to play [[Arab maqam]]s.\n\n'''Valve tremolo''': Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations. By alternating between valve combinations on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his ''[[Sequenza X]].''\n\n'''Noises''': By hissing, clicking, or breathing through the instrument, the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet. Noises may require amplification.\n\n'''Preparation''': Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water, or with certain slides removed. It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet. Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions, such as double bells and extra valves.\n\n'''[[Split tone]]''': Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds. The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth.\n\n'''Lip-trill or shake''': Also known as \"lip-slurs\". By rapidly varying air speed, but not changing the depressed valves, the pitch varies quickly between adjacent harmonic partials. Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed and the distance between the partials can be as large or small as the musicians' desires. Traditionally, however, lip-trills and shakes are usually the next partial up from the written note.\n\n'''[[Multiphonic#Brass instruments|Multi-phonics]]''': Playing a note and \"humming\" a different note simultaneously. For example, sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd \"E\" at the same time.\n\n'''[[Circular breathing]]''': A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone, without pauses for breaths. The player puffs up the cheeks, storing air, then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards.\n\n===Instruction and method books===\nOne trumpet method is [[Jean-Baptiste Arban]]'s [[Arban Method|''Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Cornet)'']].<ref>[[Jean-Baptiste Arban|Arban, Jean-Baptiste]] (1894, 1936, 1982).

The trumpet group ranges from the [[piccolo trumpet]] with the highest [[Register (music)|register]] in the brass family, to the [[bass trumpet]], which is pitched one octave below the standard B-flat or C Trumpet. Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500&nbsp;BC. They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.petrouska.com/historyofthetrumpet.htm\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608095025/http://www.petrouska.com/historyofthetrumpet.htm\n|url-status=dead\n|archivedate=2008-06-08\n|title=History of the Trumpet (According to the ''New Harvard Dictionary of Music'')\n|publisher=petrouska.com\n|accessdate=2014-12-17\n}}\n</ref> Trumpets are used in [[art music]] styles, for instance in [[orchestra]]s, [[concert band]]s, and [[jazz]] ensembles, as well as in [[popular music]]. They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's [[embouchure]]), producing a \"buzzing\" sound that starts a [[standing wave]] vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Since the late 15th century they have primarily been constructed of [[brass]] tubing, usually bent twice into a [[rectangle|rounded rectangular]] shape.<ref>[[Clint McLaughlin]], ''The No Nonsense Trumpet From A-Z'' (Dallas, Texas: Trumpet College, 1995), 7\u201310.</ref>\n\nThere are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B{{music|flat}} (a [[transposing instrument]]), having a tubing length of about {{convert|1.48|m|abbr=on}}. Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) [[brass instrument valve|valves]] in order to change their [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. There are eight combinations of three valves, making seven different tubing lengths, with the third valve sometimes used as an alternate fingering equivalent to the 1\u20132 combination. Most trumpets have valves of the [[piston valve|piston]] type, while some have the [[rotary valve|rotary]] type. The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country. Each valve, when engaged, increases the length of tubing, lowering the pitch of the instrument. A musician who plays the trumpet is called a ''trumpet player'' or ''trumpeter''.<ref name=\"elisa1\">{{Cite book|title=Dictionary for the modern trumpet player|last=Elisa.|first=Koehler|isbn=9780810886582|location=Lanham, Maryland|oclc=904281337|date = March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word \"trumpet\" was first used in the late 14th century.<ref name=\"etymonline1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=trumpet |title=Trumpet |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.etymonline.com|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote=}}</ref> The word came from Old French \"''trompette''\", which is a diminutive of ''trompe''.<ref name=\"etymonline1\"/> The word \"trump\", meaning \"trumpet,\" was first used in English in 1300.

Many modern players in Germany and the UK who perform Baroque music use a version of the natural trumpet fitted with three or four vent holes to aid in correcting out-of-tune notes in the harmonic series.<ref>John Wallace and Alexander McGrattan, ''The Trumpet'', Yale Musical Instrument Series (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2011): 239. {{ISBN|978-0-300-11230-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe melody-dominated [[homophony]] of the [[Classical period (music)|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] periods relegated the trumpet to a secondary role by most major composers owing to the limitations of the natural trumpet. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] wrote in 1844:\n<blockquote>\nNotwithstanding the real loftiness and distinguished nature of its quality of tone, there are few instruments that have been more degraded (than the trumpet). Down to [[Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], every composer&nbsp;\u2013 not excepting [[Mozart]]&nbsp;\u2013 persisted in confining it to the unworthy function of filling up, or in causing it to sound two or three commonplace rhythmical formulae.<ref>[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz, Hector]] (1844). ''[[Treatise on Instrumentation|Treatise on modern Instrumentation and Orchestration]]''. [[Edwin F. Kalmus]], NY, 1948.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Trumpet valve bypass.svg|thumb|Trumpet valve bypass (depressed)]]\n\nThe trumpet is constructed of [[brass]] tubing bent twice into a rounded oblong shape.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.dsokids.com/2001/dso.asp?PageID=162\n|title=Trumpet, Brass Instrument\n|publisher=dsokids.com\n|accessdate=2008-05-03\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref> As with all brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air through closed lips, producing a \"buzzing\" sound into the [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] and starting a [[standing wave]] vibration in the air column inside the trumpet. The player can select the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] from a range of [[overtone]]s or [[harmonics]] by changing the lip [[aperture]] and tension (known as the [[embouchure]]).\n\nThe mouthpiece has a circular rim, which provides a comfortable environment for the lips' vibration. Directly behind the rim is the cup, which channels the air into a much smaller opening (the back bore or shank) that tapers out slightly to match the diameter of the trumpet's lead pipe. The dimensions of these parts of the mouthpiece affect the [[timbre]] or quality of sound, the ease of playability, and player comfort. Generally, the wider and deeper the cup, the darker the sound and timbre.\n\n[[Image:Bb trumpet in parts.jpg|thumb|left|B{{music|flat}} trumpet, disassembled]]\n\nModern trumpets have three (or, infrequently, four) [[piston valve]]s, each of which increases the length of tubing when engaged, thereby lowering the pitch. The first valve lowers the instrument's pitch by a whole step (two [[semitone]]s), the second valve by a half step (one semitone), and the third valve by one and a half steps (three semitones). When a fourth valve is present, as with some [[piccolo trumpet]]s, it usually lowers the pitch a [[perfect fourth]] (five semitones). Used singly and in combination these valves make the instrument fully [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], i.e., able to play all twelve pitches of [[classical music]]. For more information about the different types of valves, see [[Brass instrument valves]].\n\nThe pitch of the trumpet can be raised or lowered by the use of the tuning slide. Pulling the slide out lowers the pitch; pushing the slide in raises it. To overcome the problems of intonation and reduce the use of the slide, [[Renold Schilke]] designed the tuning-bell trumpet. Removing the usual brace between the bell and a valve body allows the use of a sliding bell; the player may then tune the horn with the bell while leaving the slide pushed in, or nearly so, thereby improving intonation and overall response.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bloch |first=Dr. Colin |url=http://www.dallasmusic.org/schilke/Tunable%20Bell%20Trumpets.html |title=The Bell-Tuned Trumpet |date=August 1978 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225212331/http://www.dallasmusic.org/schilke/Tunable%20Bell%20Trumpets.html |archivedate=25 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nA trumpet becomes a [[closed tube]] when the player presses it to the lips; therefore, the instrument only naturally produces every other overtone of the harmonic series. The shape of the bell makes the missing overtones audible.<ref>D. J. Blaikley, \"How a Trumpet Is Made. I. The Natural Trumpet and Horn\", ''The Musical Times'', January 1, 1910, p. 15.</ref> Most notes in the series are slightly out of tune and modern trumpets have slide mechanisms for the first and third valves with which the player can compensate by ''throwing'' (extending) or retracting one or both slides, using the left thumb and ring finger for the first and third valve slides respectively.\n\n==Types==\nThe most common type is the B{{music|flat}} trumpet, but A, C, D, E{{music|flat}}, E, low F, and G trumpets are also available. The C trumpet is most common in American orchestral playing, where it is used alongside the B{{music|flat}} trumpet. [[Orchestral]] trumpet players are adept at transposing music at sight, frequently playing music written for the A, B{{music|flat}}, D, E{{music|flat}}, E, or F trumpet on the C trumpet or B{{music|flat}} trumpet.\n\n[[File:Trumpet piccolo.jpg|thumb|left|Piccolo trumpet in B{{music|flat}}, with swappable [[leadpipe]]s to tune the instrument to B{{music|flat}} (shorter) or A (longer)]]\n\nThe smallest trumpets are referred to as [[piccolo trumpet]]s. The most common of these are built to play in both B{{music|flat}} and A, with separate leadpipes for each key. The tubing in the B{{music|flat}} piccolo trumpet is one-half the length of that in a standard B{{music|flat}} trumpet. Piccolo trumpets in G, F and C are also manufactured, but are less common. Many players use a smaller mouthpiece on the piccolo trumpet, which requires a different sound production technique from the B{{music|flat}} trumpet and can limit endurance. Almost all piccolo trumpets have four valves instead of the usual three&nbsp;\u2014 the fourth valve lowers the pitch, usually by a fourth, to assist in the playing of lower notes and to create alternate fingerings that facilitate certain [[Trill (music)|trill]]s. [[Maurice Andr\u00e9]], [[H\u00e5kan Hardenberger]], [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]], and [[Wynton Marsalis]] are some well-known trumpet players known for their additional virtuosity on the piccolo trumpet.\n[[Image:Trumpet in c german.jpg|thumb|Trumpet in C with rotary valves]]\nTrumpets pitched in the key of low G are also called sopranos, or soprano bugles, after their adaptation from military [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s. Traditionally used in [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]], sopranos have featured both [[rotary valve]]s and [[piston valve]]s.\n\nThe bass trumpet is usually played by a [[trombone]] player, being at the same pitch.<ref name=\"elisa1\"/> Bass trumpet is played with a shallower trombone mouthpiece, and music for it is written in [[treble clef]]. The most common keys for bass trumpets are C and B{{music|flat}}. Both C and B{{music|flat}} bass trumpets are [[transposing instruments]] sounding an [[octave]] (C) or a major ninth (B{{music|flat}}) lower than written.\n\nThe historical slide trumpet was probably first developed in the late 14th century for use in [[alta cappella]] wind bands. Deriving from early straight trumpets, the Renaissance slide trumpet was essentially a natural trumpet with a sliding leadpipe. This single slide was rather awkward, as the entire corpus of the instrument moved, and the range of the slide was probably no more than a major third. Originals were probably pitched in D, to fit with [[shawm]]s in D and G, probably at a typical pitch standard near A=466&nbsp;Hz. As no known instruments from this period survive, the details\u2014and even the existence\u2014of a Renaissance slide trumpet is a matter of conjecture and debate among scholars.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/earlyj/2004/00000032/00000002/art00252\n |title       = IngentaConnect More about Renaissance slide trumpets: fact or fiction?\n |publisher   = ingentaconnect.com\n |accessdate  = 2008-05-03\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120922074227/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oup/earlyj/2004/00000032/00000002/art00252\n |archivedate = 2012-09-22\n}}\n</ref>\n\nSome slide trumpet designs saw use in England in the 18th century.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|jstor=899543\n|title=JSTOR: Notes, Second Series\n|journal=Notes\n|volume=54\n|issue=2\n|pages=484\u2013485\n|year=1997\n|last1=Lessen\n|first1=Martin\n|doi=10.2307/899543\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[pocket trumpet]] is a compact B{{music|flat}} trumpet. The bell is usually smaller than a standard trumpet and the tubing is more tightly wound to reduce the instrument size without reducing the total tube length. Its design is not standardized, and the quality of various models varies greatly. It can have a tone quality and projection unique in the trumpet world: a warm sound and a voice-like articulation. Since many pocket trumpet models suffer from poor design as well as cheap and imprecise manufacturing, the intonation, tone color and dynamic range of such instruments are severely hindered. Professional-standard instruments are, however, available. While they are not a substitute for the full-sized instrument, they can be useful in certain contexts. The jazz musician [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] was renowned for his playing of the pocket instrument.\n\nThe [[fanfare trumpet|herald trumpet]] has an elongated bell extending far in front of the player, allowing a standard length of tubing from which a flag may be hung; the instrument is mostly used for ceremonial events such as parades and [[fanfares]].\n\n[[David Monette|Monette]] designed the [[flumpet]] in 1989 for jazz musician [[Art Farmer]]. It is a hybrid instrument with elements of trumpet and flugelhorn, sharing the three piston valve design and with a pitch of B{{music|flat}}.<ref name=\"fan2017\">{{cite book|last1=Koehler|first1=Elisa|title=Fanfares and Finesse: A Performer's Guide to Trumpet History and Literature|date=2014|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253011794|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=knrDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=flumpet+1989#v=onepage&q=flumpet%201989&f=false|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are also rotary-valve, or German, trumpets (which are commonly used in professional German and Austrian orchestras) as well as alto and [[Baroque trumpet]]s.\n\nAnother variant of the standard trumpet is the [[Vienna valve]] trumpet. Primarily used in Viennese brass ensembles and orchestras such as the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] and [[Mnozil Brass]].\n\nThe trumpet is often confused with its close relative the [[cornet]], which has a more [[cone (geometry)|conical]] tubing shape compared to the trumpet's more [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] tube. This, along with additional bends in the cornet's tubing, gives the cornet a slightly mellower tone, but the instruments are otherwise nearly identical. They have the same length of tubing and, therefore, the same pitch, so music written for cornet and trumpet is interchangeable. Another relative, the [[flugelhorn]], has tubing that is even more conical than that of the cornet, and an even richer tone. It is sometimes augmented with a fourth valve to improve the intonation of some lower notes.\n\n==Playing==\n{{See also|Embouchure}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Fingering===<!--this section is linked to from [[Diminished triad chord]]-->\nOn any modern trumpet, cornet, or flugelhorn, pressing the valves indicated by the numbers below produces the written notes shown. \"Open\" means all valves up, \"1\" means first valve, \"1\u20132\" means first and second valve simultaneously, and so on. The sounding pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument. Engaging the fourth valve, if present, usually drops any of these pitches by a [[perfect fourth]] as well. Within each [[overtone]] series, the different pitches are attained by changing the [[embouchure]]. Standard fingerings above high C are the same as for the notes an octave below (C{{music|sharp}} is 1\u20132, D is 1, etc.)\n\n[[Image:Special-T trumpet overtone series.png|thumb|left|500px|A step = a [[Whole tone|tone]]; a half step = a [[semitone]]]]\n\nEach [[overtone]] series on the trumpet begins with the first overtone\u2014the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] of each overtone series cannot be produced except as a [[pedal tone]]. Notes in parentheses are the sixth overtone, representing a pitch with a frequency of seven times that of the fundamental; while this pitch is close to the note shown, it is slightly flat relative to [[equal temperament]], and use of those fingerings is generally avoided.\n\nThe fingering schema arises from the length of each valve's tubing (a longer tube produces a lower pitch). Valve \"1\" increases the tubing length enough to lower the pitch by one whole step, valve \"2\" by one half step, and valve \"3\" by one and a half steps. This scheme and the nature of the overtone series create the possibility of alternate fingerings for certain notes. For example, third-space \"C\" can be produced with no valves engaged (standard fingering) or with valves 2\u20133. Also, any note produced with 1\u20132 as its standard fingering can also be produced with valve 3 \u2013 each drops the pitch by {{frac|1|1|2}} steps. Alternate fingerings may be used to improve facility in certain passages, or to aid in intonation. Extending the third valve slide when using the fingerings 1\u20133 or 1-2-3 further lowers the pitch slightly to improve intonation.\n\nIf you take the partials of the harmonic series that a modern Bb trumpet can play for each combination of valves pressed, some notes are in tune with [[12-tone equal temperament]] and some are not. The following tables show all notes from all partials from all valve combinations in order up to high C (C6). This often gives multiple fingerings for the same note and some notes that aren't usually useful.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text-align: center; display: inline-table;\"\n!

While most types of mutes do decrease the volume the instrument produces, as the name implies, the sound modification is typically the primary reason for their use. Types of mutes most commonly used to alter the sound of the instrument are: Straight Mutes, Harmon Mutes (aka \"Wah-Wah\" Mutes), Plunger Mutes, Bucket Mutes, and Cup Mutes. A description of their construction and sound quality are below:\n\n'''Straight Mute:''' Constructed of either aluminum, which produces a bright piercing sound, or stone lined with cardboard, which produces a stuffy sound.\n\n'''Harmon Mute:''' Constructed of aluminum and consists of two parts called the \"stem\" and the \"body\". The stem can be extended or removed to produce different timbres of sound. This mute is also called the \"Wah-Wah\" mute due to its distinctive sound created by the player placing their hand over the stem opening and waving it back and forth.\n\n'''Plunger Mute:''' Most often made of a rubber bathroom [[plunger]] without the stick. This is used to manipulate sound by the player holding it over the bell with their left hand.\n\n'''Bucket Mute''': Constructed from cardboard and cloth, this mute is clipped to the end of the bell and used to muffle the sound almost completely.\n\n'''Cup Mute:''' Also constructed of cardboard, this mute is shaped exactly like a straight mute but includes a cup at the end. In many models the cup is adjustable much like the stem on the harmon mute and produces a softer more muffled sound than a traditional straight mute.\n\n==Range==\n[[File:Hejnal-Warszawski.ogg|thumb|Sound of a trumpet \u2013 [[Warsaw|Warsaw Castle]], [[Poland]].]]\nThe standard trumpet range extends from the written F{{music|sharp}} immediately below [[Middle C]] up to about three [[octaves]] higher (F{{music|sharp}}3 \u2013 F{{music|sharp}}6). Traditional [[trumpet repertoire]] rarely calls for notes beyond this range, and the fingering tables of most method books peak at the [[Soprano C|high C]], two octaves above middle C.{{Contradict-inline|date=May 2016}}<!--Three paragraphs earlier \"Standard fingerings above high C\" are mentioned.--> Several trumpeters have achieved fame for their proficiency in the extreme high register, among them [[Maynard Ferguson]], [[Cat Anderson]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Doc Severinsen]], and more recently [[Wayne Bergeron]], [[Thomas Gansch]], [[James Morrison (musician)|James Morrison]], [[Jon Faddis]] and [[Arturo Sandoval]]. It is also possible to produce [[pedal tone]]s below the low F{{music|sharp}}, which is a device occasionally employed in the contemporary repertoire for the instrument.\n\n==Extended technique==\nContemporary music for the trumpet makes wide uses of extended trumpet techniques.\n\n'''[[Fluttertonguing|Flutter tonguing]]''': The trumpeter rolls the tip of the tongue to produce a 'growling like' tone. It is achieved as if one were rolling an ''R'' in the Spanish language. This technique is widely employed by composers like [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen|Stockhausen]].\n\n'''[[Growling (wind instruments)|Growling]]''': Simultaneously playing tone while using the back of the tongue to vibrate the uvula creating a distinct sound.  Most trumpet players will use a plunger with this technique to achieve a particular sound heard in a lot of Chicago Jazz of the 1950s.\n\n'''[[Double tonguing]]''': The player articulates using the syllables ta-ka ta-ka ta-ka\n\n'''Triple tonguing''': The same as double tonguing, but with the syllables ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka ta-ta-ka or ta-ka-ta ta-ka-ta.\n\n'''Doodle tongue''': The trumpeter tongues as if saying the word ''doodle''. This is a very faint tonguing similar in sound to a valve tremolo.\n\n'''[[Glissando]]''': Trumpeters can slide between notes by depressing the valves halfway and changing the lip tension. Modern repertoire makes extensive use of this technique.\n\n'''[[Vibrato]]''': It is often regulated in contemporary repertoire through specific notation. Composers can call for everything from fast, slow or no vibrato to actual rhythmic patterns played with vibrato.\n\n'''[[Pedal tone]]''': Composers have written for two-and-a-half octaves below the low F{{Music|sharp}}, which is at the bottom of the standard range. Extreme low pedals are produced by slipping the lower lip out of the mouthpiece. [[Claude Gordon]] assigned pedals as part of his trumpet practice routines, that were a systematic expansion on his lessons with Herbert L. Clarke. The technique was pioneered by [[Bohumir Kryl]].<ref>Joseph Wheeler, \"Review: Edward H. Tarr, ''Die Trompete''\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'', Vol. 31, May, 1978, p. 167.</ref>\n\n'''[[Microtonal music|Microtones]]''': Composers such as Scelsi and Stockhausen have made wide use of the trumpet's ability to play microtonally. Some instruments feature a fourth valve that provides a quarter-tone step between each note. The jazz musician [[Ibrahim Maalouf]] uses such a trumpet, invented by his father to make it possible to play [[Arab maqam]]s.\n\n'''Valve tremolo''': Many notes on the trumpet can be played in several different valve combinations. By alternating between valve combinations on the same note, a tremolo effect can be created. Berio makes extended use of this technique in his ''[[Sequenza X]].''\n\n'''Noises''': By hissing, clicking, or breathing through the instrument, the trumpet can be made to resonate in ways that do not sound at all like a trumpet. Noises may require amplification.\n\n'''Preparation''': Composers have called for trumpeters to play under water, or with certain slides removed. It is increasingly common for composers to specify all sorts of preparations for trumpet. Extreme preparations involve alternate constructions, such as double bells and extra valves.\n\n'''[[Split tone]]''': Trumpeters can produce more than one tone simultaneously by vibrating the two lips at different speeds. The interval produced is usually an octave or a fifth.\n\n'''Lip-trill or shake''': Also known as \"lip-slurs\". By rapidly varying air speed, but not changing the depressed valves, the pitch varies quickly between adjacent harmonic partials. Shakes and lip-trills can vary in speed and the distance between the partials can be as large or small as the musicians' desires. Traditionally, however, lip-trills and shakes are usually the next partial up from the written note.\n\n'''[[Multiphonic#Brass instruments|Multi-phonics]]''': Playing a note and \"humming\" a different note simultaneously. For example, sustaining a middle C and humming a major 3rd \"E\" at the same time.\n\n'''[[Circular breathing]]''': A technique wind players use to produce uninterrupted tone, without pauses for breaths. The player puffs up the cheeks, storing air, then breathes in rapidly through the nose while using the cheeks to continue pushing air outwards.\n\n===Instruction and method books===\nOne trumpet method is [[Jean-Baptiste Arban]]'s [[Arban Method|''Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet (Cornet)'']].<ref>[[Jean-Baptiste Arban|Arban, Jean-Baptiste]] (1894, 1936, 1982).
