The colour used on the arms Lord Hobart was, in fact, sable (black), rather than blue.\n\nThe red lion is from the Tasmanian flag - and its location at the top of the shield signifies Hobart's position as the Capital City.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hobartcity.com.au/Council/About-Council/Hobart-Coat-of-Arms | title=Hobart Coat of Arms - City of Hobart, Tasmania Australia | accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{ListFlag|Tasmania Launceston City Flag.svg}}\n| \n| Flag of the [[City of Launceston]]\n| The Launceston flag design is based on the city's Coat of Arms granted by the College of Arms, London on 11 June 1957.<ref name=\"CoatofArms\">{{cite web |title = Coat of Arms |publisher=Launceston City Council |url = http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=1283 |accessdate =16 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080722054429/http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/subsector.php?id=1283 |archivedate = 22 July 2008}}</ref> The Brisbane Street Mall, the War memorial at Royal Park, the original Queen Victoria Museum (now the Art Gallery) building, atop the Council Chambers and on top of the Albert Hall are places in the city where the flag is regularly flown. The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city's three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with the jagged edge is green to represent the city's parks, gardens and surrounding countryside.

Within 14 years, others bought and improved land lying near his, along the banks of what is now [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]]. Titus named the village Edinburg(h), but as it grew, the settlers began to call the hamlet Titusville. The village was incorporated as a borough in 1849. It was a slow-growing community until the 1850s, when [[petroleum]] was discovered in the region.[[File:Titusville, Pennsylvania (8483326973).jpg|thumb|Downtown Titusville, PA in 2014]]\n\nOil was known to exist there, but there was no practical way to extract it.

[[Edwin L. Drake]], to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now [[Oil Creek State Park]].<ref name=\"WDL\"/> In the summer of 1859, Drake hired a [[salt well]] driller, William A. Smith. They had many difficulties but, on August 27, at the site of an oil spring just south of Titusville, they finally drilled a well that could be commercially successful.\n\n[[File:Ariel photograph of the Titusville Area High School.jpg|thumb|Titusville High School]]\n\n[[Teamster]]s were needed immediately to transport the oil to markets. In 1862, the Oil Creek & Titusville Railroad was built between Titusville and [[Corry, Pennsylvania|Corry]], where the product was transferred to larger east-west railroad lines. In 1865, pipelines were laid directly to the line and the demand for teamsters practically ended. The next year the railroad line was extended south to [[Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania|Petroleum Centre]] and [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]]. The Union & Titusville Railroad was built in 1865.  That line became part of the [[Philadelphia and Erie Railroad]] in 1871. That fall, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] visited Titusville to view the important region.\n\nOther oil-related businesses were quickly established. Eight refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Drilling tools were needed and several iron works were built. Titusville grew from 250 residents to 10,000 almost overnight and in 1866, it incorporated as a city. In 1871, the first oil exchange in the United States was established there.  The exchange moved from the city, but returned in 1881 in a new, brick building, before being dissolved in 1897.<ref>[http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=447 Explorepahistory.com] Accessed August 8, 2008</ref>\n\nThe first oil [[millionaire]] was Jonathan Watson, a resident of Titusville.  He owned the land where Drake's well was drilled.  He had been a partner in a lumber business prior to the success of the well.  At one time it was said that Titusville had more millionaires per 1,000 population than anywhere else in the world.\n\nOne resident of note was Franklin S. Tarbell, whose large [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] home still stands. He first moved a few miles south in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] and established a wooden stock tank business. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} south-east of Titusville was another oil boom city, [[Pithole, Pennsylvania|Pithole]]. Oil was discovered in a rolling meadow there in January 1865 and, by September 1865, the population was 15,000. But the oil soon ran dry and within four years the city was nearly deserted. Tarbell moved to Titusville in 1870. His daughter, [[Ida M. Tarbell|Ida Minerva Tarbell]], grew up amidst the sounds and smells of the oil industry. She became an accomplished writer and published a series of articles about the business practices of the [[Standard Oil Company]] and its president, [[John D. Rockefeller]], which sparked legislative action in Congress concerning monopolies.{{US Census population\n|1850= 245\n|1860= 438\n|1870= 8639\n|1880= 11982\n|1890= 12786\n|1900= 11738\n|1910= 8533\n|1920= 8432\n|1930= 8055\n|1940= 8126\n|1950= 8923\n|1960= 8356\n|1970= 7331\n|1980= 6884\n|1990= 6434\n|2000= 6146\n|2010= 5601\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5237\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web |last1=Bureau |first1=U.

It came to be known as \"Black Friday\", when almost {{convert|300000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. The destroyed oil was valued at $2 million, but there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of [[petroleum ether]] overturned. The [[petroleum ether]] ignited and, in the ensuing explosions, 60 men, women and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in {{convert|27000|oilbbl|l|abbr=off|sp=us}} of oil being lost in a fire.\n\nOil production in [[Pennsylvania]] peaked in 1891, after which other industries became established in Titusville. The iron and steel industries dominated the town in the early twentieth century, with lumber eventually reclaiming its former pre-eminence. Oil still has some relevance, however.

Within 14 years, others bought and improved land lying near his, along the banks of what is now [[Oil Creek (Allegheny River)|Oil Creek]]. Titus named the village Edinburg(h), but as it grew, the settlers began to call the hamlet Titusville. The village was incorporated as a borough in 1849. It was a slow-growing community until the 1850s, when [[petroleum]] was discovered in the region.[[File:Titusville, Pennsylvania (8483326973).jpg|thumb|Downtown Titusville, PA in 2014]]\n\nOil was known to exist there, but there was no practical way to extract it.

[[Edwin L. Drake]], to start drilling on a piece of leased land just south of Titusville, near what is now [[Oil Creek State Park]].<ref name=\"WDL\"/> In the summer of 1859, Drake hired a [[salt well]] driller, William A. Smith. They had many difficulties but, on August 27, at the site of an oil spring just south of Titusville, they finally drilled a well that could be commercially successful.\n\n[[File:Ariel photograph of the Titusville Area High School.jpg|thumb|Titusville High School]]\n\n[[Teamster]]s were needed immediately to transport the oil to markets. In 1862, the Oil Creek & Titusville Railroad was built between Titusville and [[Corry, Pennsylvania|Corry]], where the product was transferred to larger east-west railroad lines. In 1865, pipelines were laid directly to the line and the demand for teamsters practically ended. The next year the railroad line was extended south to [[Petroleum Center, Pennsylvania|Petroleum Centre]] and [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]]. The Union & Titusville Railroad was built in 1865.  That line became part of the [[Philadelphia and Erie Railroad]] in 1871. That fall, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] visited Titusville to view the important region.\n\nOther oil-related businesses were quickly established. Eight refineries were built between 1862 and 1868. Drilling tools were needed and several iron works were built. Titusville grew from 250 residents to 10,000 almost overnight and in 1866, it incorporated as a city. In 1871, the first oil exchange in the United States was established there.  The exchange moved from the city, but returned in 1881 in a new, brick building, before being dissolved in 1897.<ref>[http://www.explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=447 Explorepahistory.com] Accessed August 8, 2008</ref>\n\nThe first oil [[millionaire]] was Jonathan Watson, a resident of Titusville.  He owned the land where Drake's well was drilled.  He had been a partner in a lumber business prior to the success of the well.  At one time it was said that Titusville had more millionaires per 1,000 population than anywhere else in the world.\n\nOne resident of note was Franklin S. Tarbell, whose large [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] home still stands. He first moved a few miles south in [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] and established a wooden stock tank business. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} south-east of Titusville was another oil boom city, [[Pithole, Pennsylvania|Pithole]]. Oil was discovered in a rolling meadow there in January 1865 and, by September 1865, the population was 15,000. But the oil soon ran dry and within four years the city was nearly deserted. Tarbell moved to Titusville in 1870. His daughter, [[Ida M. Tarbell|Ida Minerva Tarbell]], grew up amidst the sounds and smells of the oil industry. She became an accomplished writer and published a series of articles about the business practices of the [[Standard Oil Company]] and its president, [[John D. Rockefeller]], which sparked legislative action in Congress concerning monopolies.{{US Census population\n|1850= 245\n|1860= 438\n|1870= 8639\n|1880= 11982\n|1890= 12786\n|1900= 11738\n|1910= 8533\n|1920= 8432\n|1930= 8055\n|1940= 8126\n|1950= 8923\n|1960= 8356\n|1970= 7331\n|1980= 6884\n|1990= 6434\n|2000= 6146\n|2010= 5601\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=5237\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web |last1=Bureau |first1=U.

It came to be known as \"Black Friday\", when almost {{convert|300000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. The destroyed oil was valued at $2 million, but there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of [[petroleum ether]] overturned. The [[petroleum ether]] ignited and, in the ensuing explosions, 60 men, women and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in {{convert|27000|oilbbl|l|abbr=off|sp=us}} of oil being lost in a fire.\n\nOil production in [[Pennsylvania]] peaked in 1891, after which other industries became established in Titusville. The iron and steel industries dominated the town in the early twentieth century, with lumber eventually reclaiming its former pre-eminence. Oil still has some relevance, however.

While both men began performing on screen at the same time, the height of Gable's celebrity preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years.\n\n==Missed roles==\n* Wayne rebuffed the lead role in the 1952 film ''[[High Noon]]'' because he felt the film's story was an allegory against [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]], which he actively supported. In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered ''High Noon'' \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life\", and that he would \"never regret having helped run screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], [who was later blacklisted] out of the country\".<ref name=davis/>{{rp|142}}\n* An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and recommended [[James Arness]] instead.

They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project. Both Wayne and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it.

Only [[Clark Gable]] sold more tickets than Wayne, although the ticket prices paid during the span of their respective careers are not really commensurate. While both men began performing on screen at the same time, the height of Gable's celebrity preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years.\n\n==Missed roles==\n* Wayne rebuffed the lead role in the 1952 film ''[[High Noon]]'' because he felt the film's story was an allegory against [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]], which he actively supported. In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered ''High Noon'' \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life\", and that he would \"never regret having helped run screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], [who was later blacklisted] out of the country\".<ref name=davis/>{{rp|142}}\n* An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and recommended [[James Arness]] instead. While he did suggest Arness for the part and introduced him in a prologue to the first episode, no film star of Wayne's stature would have considered a television role at the time.<ref>Barabas, S. ''Gunsmoke: A Complete History''. McFarland (1990), pp. 63\u20134. {{ISBN|0899504183}}.</ref>\n* [[Terry Southern]]'s biographer Lee Hill wrote that the role of Major T. J. \"King\" Kong in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) was originally written with Wayne in mind, and that [[Stanley Kubrick]] offered him the part after [[Peter Sellers]] injured his ankle during filming; he immediately turned it down.<ref name=Hill>Lee Hill, ''A Grand Guy: The Life and Art of Terry Southern'' (Bloomsbury, 2001), pp.118\u2013119</ref>\n* In 1966, Wayne accepted the role of Major Reisman in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967), and asked [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for some script changes, but eventually withdrew from the project to make ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]''. He was replaced by [[Lee Marvin]].<ref>Eyman, S. ''John Wayne: The Life and Legend''. Simon & Schuster (2014), p.78. {{ISBN|1439199582}}</ref>\n* Though Wayne actively campaigned for the title role in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), [[Warner Bros.]] decided that at 63 he was too old, and cast the 41-year-old [[Clint Eastwood]].<ref>Eyman (2014), p. 143.</ref>\n* Director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] and screenwriter [[Larry McMurtry]] pitched a film in 1971 called [[Streets of Laredo (film)|''Streets of Laredo'']] that would co-star Wayne along with [[James Stewart]] and [[Henry Fonda]]. They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project. Both Wayne and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it. He said, 'You know, that was an important war, and you're making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor.

The absence of such explanatory elements preserved the realism of the picture but also required the viewer to have prior information to understand the subject.  As most of his works were commissioned by the highest military leaders in the Habsburg (Spanish and Imperial) army they would have known the scenes depicted.\n\nHis large canvases clearly played a dual role: they documented the historical event and at the same time they glorified the military men who participated in the action.  The compositions were painted from the point of the patron who commissioned them. Equestrian portraits of the patrons and their coats of arms were included so that their military feats were immortalized.  The compositions thus justified the patrons' eminent status in society as well as their loyalty to the Habsburg court. The heroic images were also intended to serve as a model for later generations. As his works' distribution remained limited to the Spanish side, the decay of the Habsburg dynasty in the second half of the 17th century affected the artist's international reputation.<ref name=kdoc/>\n\nSnayers often painted scenes of assaults by robbers on travelers and of soldiers plundering villages, a subject matter closely related to his military scenes.

The absence of such explanatory elements preserved the realism of the picture but also required the viewer to have prior information to understand the subject.  As most of his works were commissioned by the highest military leaders in the Habsburg (Spanish and Imperial) army they would have known the scenes depicted.\n\nHis large canvases clearly played a dual role: they documented the historical event and at the same time they glorified the military men who participated in the action.  The compositions were painted from the point of the patron who commissioned them. Equestrian portraits of the patrons and their coats of arms were included so that their military feats were immortalized.  The compositions thus justified the patrons' eminent status in society as well as their loyalty to the Habsburg court. The heroic images were also intended to serve as a model for later generations. As his works' distribution remained limited to the Spanish side, the decay of the Habsburg dynasty in the second half of the 17th century affected the artist's international reputation.<ref name=kdoc/>\n\nSnayers often painted scenes of assaults by robbers on travelers and of soldiers plundering villages, a subject matter closely related to his military scenes.

Prado Museum, Madrid.|alt=]]\n\nThe Torre de la Parada was a hunting lodge of the Spanish king near [[Madrid]].  Rubens had received a commission from the Spanish king [[Philip IV of Spain]] to create a series of paintings to decorate the hunting lodge.  A majority of the paintings depicted mythological scenes largely based on the [[Metamorphoses]] of [[Ovid]].  Rubens realized this important commission with the assistance of a large number of Antwerp painters such as [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Cornelis de Vos]], [[Jan Cossiers]], [[Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert]], [[Theodoor van Thulden]], [[Jan Boeckhorst]], [[Jan Baptist Borrekens]], [[Peeter Symons]], and [[Jacob Peter Gowy]] and others, who worked after Rubens' designs. Snayers was also involved in this project as a collaborator. Two large canvases showing King Philip IV at the hunt are attributed to him.<ref>[https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/torre-de-la-parada/78f1c689-b905-4189-a80b-a9c97a32303e Javier Port\u00fas P\u00e9rez, ''Torre de la Parada''] on the Prado website {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>[https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/rubens-y-la-torre-de-la-parada/4bc99562-5ae7-47a2-84a8-0b8136c277d9 Alejandro Vergara, ''Rubens y la Torre de la Parada''] on the Prado website {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref name=sil>Larry Silver, ''Rubens, Velazquez, and the King of Spain'', Routledge, 5 Jul 2017</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline|Category:Peter Snayers|Peter Snayers}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Snayers, Peter}}\n[[Category:1592 births]]\n[[Category:1660s deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Antwerp]]\n[[Category:Flemish Baroque painters]]\n[[Category:Flemish war artists]]\n[[Category:Flemish landscape painters]]\n[[Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke]]\n[[Category:People from Brussels]]\n[[Category:Members of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke]]\n[[Category:Court painters]]\n[[Category:17th-century war artists]]\n", "name_user": "FydelJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "adding information about his work located in Spain", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Snayers"}

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches. In 2002/2003 ''Skra'' took 6th place in the league and lost in the second round of the [[CEV Cup]] in a match against Russian club Lokomotiv Yekaterinburg.

The team repeated this success in the next season, when they won second title of Polish Champion in four final matches with [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]], and Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] (3-0)). They lost two matches against Greek [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.]] in play-off 6 of [[2005\u201306 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2005/2006]].\n\nIn 2006, the new coach was [[Daniel Castellani]], who was the first coach of the club from outside Poland. He spent three seasons in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. During his work ''PGE Skra'' won next three title of Polish Champion (2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009) and two Polish Cups (2007, 2009).

Next day, ''PGE Skra'' players won bronze medal in match with Italian [[Sisley Treviso]] (3-2).\n\nIn 2009 a new coach was hired. It was [[Jacek Nawrocki]]. The first success under the guidance of the new coach was the silver medal in the [[2009 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|FIVB Club World Championship 2009]]. At this tournament after promoting from Pool B, ''PGE Skra'' won their semi final against [[VC Zenit-Kazan]] (3-1), but on November 8, 2009 the Polish club lost the final against [[Trentino Volley]] (0-3). 2 of 7 individual awards were received by ''PGE Skra'' players - [[Bartosz Kurek]] as the ''Best Scorer'', [[Marcin Mo\u017cd\u017conek]] as the ''Best Blocker''.\nIn 2010 the Polish team was the host of the Final Four [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2009/2010]] again.

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches. In 2002/2003 ''Skra'' took 6th place in the league and lost in the second round of the [[CEV Cup]] in a match against Russian club Lokomotiv Yekaterinburg.

The team repeated this success in the next season, when they won second title of Polish Champion in four final matches with [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]], and Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] (3-0)). They lost two matches against Greek [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.]] in play-off 6 of [[2005\u201306 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2005/2006]].\n\nIn 2006, the new coach was [[Daniel Castellani]], who was the first coach of the club from outside Poland. He spent three seasons in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. During his work ''PGE Skra'' won next three title of Polish Champion (2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009) and two Polish Cups (2007, 2009).

Next day, ''PGE Skra'' players won bronze medal in match with Italian [[Sisley Treviso]] (3-2).\n\nIn 2009 a new coach was hired. It was [[Jacek Nawrocki]]. The first success under the guidance of the new coach was the silver medal in the [[2009 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|FIVB Club World Championship 2009]]. At this tournament after promoting from Pool B, ''PGE Skra'' won their semi final against [[VC Zenit-Kazan]] (3-1), but on November 8, 2009 the Polish club lost the final against [[Trentino Volley]] (0-3). 2 of 7 individual awards were received by ''PGE Skra'' players - [[Bartosz Kurek]] as the ''Best Scorer'', [[Marcin Mo\u017cd\u017conek]] as the ''Best Blocker''.\nIn 2010 the Polish team was the host of the Final Four [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2009/2010]] again.

For most inhabitants, agriculture is not only a way to make a living, but also a family tradition.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Sokolac used to be known for its high quality potatoes; until recently, potato chip manufacturing was a promising industry for the region.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Livestock production is the second largest agricultural industry in the community. The area surrounding Sokolac is well known for its quality grasslands, due to the foggy, moist conditions that keep the grass green for much of the year and make it well suited for grazing dairy, cattle and sheep.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Beef, cattle and mutton/lamb are the second largest export of the community. Although Sokolac has a small dairy factory, the milk market production is very small. Sokolac is surrounded by high quality woodlands, which have been largely cut down in last ten years.{{when|date=February 2018}}{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Although this industry generates the most revenue for the community, only a small percentage of people work in that industry.\n\nSokolac is an important intersection for regional transport routes. The roads that intersect in Sokolac are between [[Sarajevo]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]], [[Belgrade]], [[U\u017eice]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Bijeljina]].<ref>[http://www.balkaninside.com/interview-with-milovan-bjelica-the-mayor-of-sokolac/]</ref>\n\nSokolac has a large forest complex. The municipality possesses 38,013 hectares of forest, of which 94.76% of it is state-owned forest whilst 5.24% is private property.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} This gives Sokolac a total timber supply of up to 8,482,000 cubic meters.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Of agricultural land (32,834 hectares), meadows and pastures comprise 28,232 hectares and fields and orchards comprise 4,602 hectares.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

For most inhabitants, agriculture is not only a way to make a living, but also a family tradition.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Sokolac used to be known for its high quality potatoes; until recently, potato chip manufacturing was a promising industry for the region.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Livestock production is the second largest agricultural industry in the community. The area surrounding Sokolac is well known for its quality grasslands, due to the foggy, moist conditions that keep the grass green for much of the year and make it well suited for grazing dairy, cattle and sheep.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Beef, cattle and mutton/lamb are the second largest export of the community. Although Sokolac has a small dairy factory, the milk market production is very small. Sokolac is surrounded by high quality woodlands, which have been largely cut down in last ten years.{{when|date=February 2018}}{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Although this industry generates the most revenue for the community, only a small percentage of people work in that industry.\n\nSokolac is an important intersection for regional transport routes. The roads that intersect in Sokolac are between [[Sarajevo]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]], [[Belgrade]], [[U\u017eice]], [[Banja Luka]] and [[Bijeljina]].<ref>[http://www.balkaninside.com/interview-with-milovan-bjelica-the-mayor-of-sokolac/]</ref>\n\nSokolac has a large forest complex. The municipality possesses 38,013 hectares of forest, of which 94.76% of it is state-owned forest whilst 5.24% is private property.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} This gives Sokolac a total timber supply of up to 8,482,000 cubic meters.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}} Of agricultural land (32,834 hectares), meadows and pastures comprise 28,232 hectares and fields and orchards comprise 4,602 hectares.{{citation_needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]]. The wrappers used for Hershey's KISSES chocolates are squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]] with a narrow strip of paper called a plume protruding from the top of each Hershey KISS.  The Hershey KiSSES paper plumes were added to the product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nThe Hershey Kisses were first introduced in 1907. At first, the Hershey Kisses were wrapped by hands and fingers but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. Brothers Walter, Howard and Raymond Phillippy made improvements, such as devices to reject misshapen Kisses and position unwrapped candies upright.  This is also when the paper plume or flag was added to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume or paper flag protruding from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> During 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were used to create chocolate paste for the soldiers in World War II. In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 60 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced. Hershey introduces and discontinues new KISSES flavors constantly as part of its standard KISSES offering, including holidays. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hersheys.com/en_us/products.html|title=HERSHEY'S Chocolate & Candy &#124; HERSHEY\u2019S Products|website=www.hersheys.com}}</ref>\n\n===United States and Canada===\n<!-- This list gets too long if all varieties are included.

The bite-sized pieces of chocolate have a distinctive shape, commonly described as flat-bottomed [[Drop (liquid)|teardrops]]. The wrappers used for Hershey's KISSES chocolates are squares of lightweight [[aluminium foil|aluminum foil]] with a narrow strip of paper called a plume protruding from the top of each Hershey KISS.  The Hershey KiSSES paper plumes were added to the product wrapper in 1921 in order to distinguish the Hershey's KISS from its competitors who offered similar products.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/hersheyarchives30-18-only-hersheys-kisses-are-kisses/|title=HersheyArchives@30, Part 18: Only Hershey\u2019s Kisses are Kisses \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>  \n\n==History==\n[[File:Old Hershey Kisses Ad photographed March 23 2013-8579.jpg|thumb|left|Old Hershey Kisses [[advertising|ad]]]]\n\nThe Hershey Kisses were first introduced in 1907. At first, the Hershey Kisses were wrapped by hands and fingers but in 1921, a machine was made so the Kisses would be wrapped automatically. Brothers Walter, Howard and Raymond Phillippy made improvements, such as devices to reject misshapen Kisses and position unwrapped candies upright.  This is also when the paper plume or flag was added to the aluminum foil wrapper to identify the Hershey's KISS, replacing the original small square of printed tissue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hersheyarchives.org/encyclopedia/its-the-cocoa-bean-baby/|title=It\u2019s the Cocoa Bean, Baby \u2013 Hershey Community Archives}}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Milton S. Hershey received a registered design trademark (Reg. 0186828) for \"foil wrapped conical configuration with plume\" which included the KISSES paper plume or paper flag protruding from the top of the aluminum foil wrapper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=doc&state=4805:8klpj5.2.1|title=TESS -- Error|website=tmsearch.uspto.gov}}</ref> During 1942, production of Hershey Kisses was briefly interrupted due to the rationing of aluminum foil. Instead, the machines were used to create chocolate paste for the soldiers in World War II. In 1976, Hershey received a registered trademark for the Hershey's KISSES foil wrapper.\n\nKisses are one of the most popular brands of candies in the US. In 1989, the chocolate drops were the 5th most popular chocolate brand in the United States, spawning sales that topped $400 million. More than 60 million Hershey's Kisses chocolates are produced each day at the company's two factories. Today's Kisses brand chocolates use Hershey's original [[milk chocolate]] formula.\n\nIn 2005 [[Hershey's Kissables]] were introduced as a smaller sized, candy coated version of Kisses chocolates. They were discontinued in 2009.\n{{-}}\n\n==Kisses brand varieties==\n[[Image:HolidayHersheyKissCarmel.jpg|thumb|Hershey's Kisses Milk Chocolates filled with [[caramel]].]]\n\nThough originally made of solely [[milk chocolate]], many variations of the Kisses brand of chocolates and candies have since been introduced.
