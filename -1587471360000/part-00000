The game's name comes from the action of capturing an opponent's piece by landing on its space, which is known as \"aggravating\".\n\n''Aggravation'' is one of the many variations of the game [[Pachisi]] and is based on the older German game [[Mensch \u00e4rgere Dich nicht]]. It was first produced in 1960 by CO-5 Company. Later versions were made by [[Minneapolis]]-based [[Lakeside Toys|Lakeside Industries]], a division of [[Leisure Dynamic]]. Today, it is manufactured by [[Winning Moves]], under license from [[Hasbro]].\n\nIts distinctive features are that the track accommodates from four to six players, unlike other Pachisi-like games which only allow four; that it is normally drilled to accept colored glass [[marble (toy)|marbles]] as playing pieces; and that it incorporates \"shortcuts\". There are no \"safe\" holes where a player's marbles cannot be captured (or \"aggravated\", in the game's parlance) other than the player's own base and home sections.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nOlder versions of the game usually feature an [[asterisk]]-shaped board, which is perfectly [[symmetrical]] and identical in shape and size from all angles. In addition, older versions allowed up to four players instead of six. However, modern versions of the game produced by Parker Brothers are made in an irregular pattern with a shape that varies for each player, though all players must travel an equal number of spaces in order to reach their respective home sections.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Sequence of play==\nThe game starts with each player's placing four marbles in his/her \"base\". After the order of play is determined through the rolling of the die, each player rolls a single die on each turn to determine the number of spaces to move. All marbles remain in the base until either a 1 or 6 is rolled, which entitles the player to move a marble from the base to his/her \"start\", the first step before entering the track. While this is considered a turn, and the move takes place in lieu of moving a marble that number of spaces, a six, if rolled, entitles a player to another turn whenever a legal move can be made.  \n\nThe winner is the first player whose pieces all reach home by exact count.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/Aggravation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Aggravation Rules|website=Fgbradleys.com|accessdate=12 November 2017}}</ref> If playing partners when your partner has all their marbles in home then they can roll to help get your marbles home faster,\n\n===Shortcuts===\nThe hole in the center of the board is known as the \"short cut\". A player who is able to land a marble in this location by exact count has the option of taking a route even faster to home. The short cut, though, has the drawback in that it may only be exited by rolling a 1.\n\n===Aggravating===\nA player who lands a marble on a space occupied by an opponent's marble \"aggravates\" that player's piece and sends it back to that player's base. A player's piece may not be aggravated if it is on an inside corner as these are safe from aggravation. You must land on the space either before or after your opponent.\n\nPlayers are prohibited from landing on or passing their own marble. If this happens they can not move. If you rolled a 6 then you may roll again. If playing teams, you cannot land on or pass your partner. If, however, there are multiple marbles, you can't jump over or aggravate a marble in the middle or front.\n\n==Tournaments==\nThe Unicorn Club{{clarify|date=May 2014}} has an annual season in which 30 games plus a series of two championship games (total 32 games) are played. Rather than using a board with marbles, a replica of the board is used on a field.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nEach color represents a team of 5 players, one of whom is designated as the leader; they wear T-shirts in their respective colors. The four players take the place of marbles; the leader watches, rolls, and makes decisions.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nEach team has five home games during a season. Fans of each team, who are usually family and friends of the players, come to its home games and root for the team.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nNeutral officials are present at every game, making rulings in disputes.\n\nIn team play, the following new rules are added:\n* The team finishing first wins the game. But all teams are required to finish.\n* The first-place finisher in the previous game gets three bonus rolls. The second-place finisher gets two, and the third-place finisher gets one. Bonus rolls are used following the move of a player from the base to start with a 1. Their use is required when one is available; they cannot be passed up and stored.\n* The first-place finisher gets to start the following game first with a player on start rather than on the base. The order is always the same otherwise, resembling the colors of the real board.\n* The fifth-place finisher must wait until the first 4 teams have a player freed from the base before being allowed to start.\n* The last place finisher must wait until all 5 other teams have started, ''and'' at least one team (3 if cursed) has reached the home section (safety).\n* If a team has all its players sent back to start (square one), it is considered as if it had already freed a player for the purpose of allowing other teams to start.\n* A roll of 5 allows a bonus roll if used to move a player from start to a shortcut (known as \"the wheel\"). This applies even if it is another team's start. This move is known as a \"Hi-Five\". Teams have the tradition of holding a player in the start as long as possible, waiting and hoping for a Hi-Five. This is called \"Hi-Five ready\". Hi-Fives are used to get most players around the board.\n* Moving onto another team's start is prohibited unless:\n:# That team's base is empty\n:# It is reached by a 6\n:# There is no other possible legal move\n: However, if a player manages to land there by any of the above methods, she or he may remain there as long as the team wishes.\n* The super shortcut cannot be used until at least one team has finished. Even then, it can only be accessed from the six spaces from one's own start.\n* After five teams have successfully finished, if the final team is unable to make a legal move in 6 consecutive rolls, or fails to finish within 6 rolls after bringing its final piece into home stretch (the last seven spaces before the finish), the team does not finish. It is considered \"cursed,\" meaning that it cannot start the next game until at least three other teams bring a player into safety.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hasbro}}\n\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Cross and circle games]]\n[[Category:Parker Brothers games]]\n[[Category:Racing board games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1960 board game}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox game\n| title=''Aggravation''\n| italic title=yes\n| image=Aggravation Board.jpg\n| image_size=220\n| caption=Home made Aggravation board\n| designer=[[Lakeside Industries]]\n| publisher=[[Lakeside Industries]] (past)<br>[[Parker Brothers]] (past)<br> [[Winning Moves]] (present)\n| players=2\u20136\n| setup_time= \n| playing_time=\n| strategy=\n| random_chance=\n| skills=[[Strategy]], [[Probability]]\n| bggid=\n| bggxrefs=\n| footnotes =\n}}\n\n'''''Aggravation''''' is a [[board game]] for up to four players and later versions for up to six players, whose object is to be the first player to have all four playing pieces (usually represented by [[marble (toy)|marbles]]) reach the player's home section of the board.

The handloom weaving style unique to this region are famously known as Santipuri Sari (tant). After the partition of India, Bengal was split into two major regions.  West Bengal became a part of India and East Bengal became East Pakistan (Bangladesh).  Many skilled weavers from Dhaka, in current day Bangladesh, migrated into West Bengal and settled around the cities of Shantipur and Kalna (Ambika Kalna) of Bardhaman district.  Both are traditionally renowned centers for producing hand-woven fabrics sold throughout the country. Through government support for Indian handicrafts and arts, the weaving community slowly grew and thrived. Saris and finely woven feather-touch textiles are still being produced in the same traditional method today. One can find the patterns and colors found in ancient times still reflected in the garments produced in the vast textile belt of Shantipur, [[Phulia]], [[Samudragarh]], [[Dhatrigram]] and [[Kalna, India|Ambika Kalna]].  Each center produces superb fabrics in its own variation of the Shantipuri style of weaving. Shantipur is especially known for super-fine-weave dhotis and jacquards. These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\nMost of the people in the Sutragarh area of \u200b\u200bShantipur are engaged in textile trade.\u00a0 There is a weaving cloth market's here.\u00a0 This market's is held two days a week on Sunday and Thursday from 4 am to 2 pm. People from nearby villages come to this market's to do business. From here the weaving cloth goes to different parts of the country and is also exported abroad. Weaving sari is also available at Station clothes market, Bara Bazar, various clothing stores in Shantipur and various sari shops in Phulia. \n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.\n\n[[Kali Puja]] is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .\n\nThere is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as \"Pateshwari\" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth. The deity is worshiped for 3 days during the \"[[Rash Utsav]].\" The second day of worship is marked by the sacrifice of a goat. It is then incorporated into the many festive meals and shared with the community until the festival ends. The \"Pateshwari [[Hindu temple|Mandir]]\" is one of the oldest temples in Shantipur, dating back to the 16th century,<ref> [https://www.wbtourismgov.in/destination/attractions_activities/nadia WB Tourism] </ref> with such a painted canvas of Goddess [[Kali]].\n\nHere Jagadhatri worship is celebrated.\u00a0 Jagadhatri puja is celebrated in the Sutragarh area of \u200b\u200bShantipur.\u00a0 Sutragarh's Jagadhatri Puja is estimated to be more than 350 years old.\u00a0 All Jagadhatri Pratimas are still worshiped in the name of King Krishnachandra in this place.\u00a0 Various gods and goddesses were held in the center of Jagadhatri worship here.\u00a0(Kali, Santoshi Mata, Bharat Mata, Durga, Komolekamini, Annapurna, Narayan, Nataraj and others)\n\nJagadhatri Puja is held here for three days and after three days of worship, Pratima is Niranjan by performing a Luminous procession.\n\n==Notable people==\nNotable people from Shantipur include: [[Advaita Acharya]], [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]][[Azizul Haque (educator)|, Sir Azizul Haque,]] [[Mohammad Mozammel Huq|Kabi Mohammed Mozammel Haque]], [[Krittibas Ojha|Kabi Krittibas Ojha]], [[Arun Chandra Guha|Kabi Jatindra Nath Sengupta, Kabi Karunanidhan Bandyopadhyay, Ahendra Choudhary, Arun Chandra Guha]], Nirmalendu Laheri, Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Maitra.<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n\n==Transport==\n[[Shantipur railway station]] is well connected by rail by EMU railway services running from [[Sealdah railway station]] (Main section).\n\nIt is also well connected with North and South Bengal by various State Transport Services.

These textiles are marketed through co-operatives and various commercial undertakings.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.indiaprofile.com/art-crafts/bengal-art.htm | title = A Traditional Panorama - Bengal Art|accessdate = 2007-09-08 | work = Arts and Crafts in India| publisher =  India Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Religious History==\nThe old and historical town Shantipur is famous for Ras Utsav and [[Holi|\"Dol utsav\"]] which is thought to have begun by Mathuresh Goswami, the great grandson of [[Advaita Acharya]] who was one of the main associates of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]].\n[[File:Ras Leela of Lord Krishna.jpg|alt=Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|thumb|Ras Leela of Lord Krishna|border|right]]\nThe principle deity of the town is 'Radharaman' in the family of Baro Gosai descending from the lineage of Mathuresh Goswami. The deity was originally installed as a single statue of krishna named 'dol govinda' in Orissa by king indradyumna. When the king of [[Jessore District|Yessore]] (now in Bangladesh), [[Maharaja Pratapaditya|Pratapaditya]] attacked Orissa, the priest of the temple gave away the deity to his own guru Mathuresh Goswami to protect it in times of emergency. He brought the idol to his ancestral home in Shantipur where he reinstalled it in a new temple. A deity of [[Radha]] was later installed beside Dolgovinda and both of them renamed Radharaman.\n\n[[File:Rasyatra.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Procession showing Krishna|Rashyatra - celebrations of the loves of Krishna]]\n\nThe deity believed to be worshipped by [[Advaita Acharya]] himself is named Madan Gopal and is worshipped in the lineage of Krishna Mishra, the second son of [[Advaita Acharya]].\n\nOn the day of Rashyatra, the main festival of the town, all of them are taken out in a grand procession around the city accompanied with drums, kirtan and other celebration. Curiously, all the thrones are lit with the age-old Belgium glass candleholders and chandeliers, instead of electric lighting, even to this day. This gives Rashotsav a very ancient and historical look. On this day, as a continuation of a tradition introduced by Bara Goswamis near about 250 years ago, a young girl, called Rai-Raja (Rai is another name for Radha and Raja means king), dressed in expensive attire and gold ornaments is seated in a throne and paraded across the city to be worshipped as Radha.\n\n[[Kali Puja]] is another festival that the people of this place pays a lot of dedication .\n\nThere is a unique form of celebrating Kali worship in the form of hand painted image of the deity known as \"Pateshwari\" meaning drawing of the deity on a piece of cloth. The deity is worshiped for 3 days during the \"[[Rash Utsav]].\" The second day of worship is marked by the sacrifice of a goat. It is then incorporated into the many festive meals and shared with the community until the festival ends. The \"Pateshwari [[Hindu temple|Mandir]]\" is one of the oldest temples in Shantipur, dating back to the 16th century,<ref> [https://www.wbtourismgov.in/destination/attractions_activities/nadia WB Tourism] </ref> with such a painted canvas of Goddess [[Kali]].\n\nHere Jagadhatri worship is celebrated.\u00a0 Jagadhatri puja is celebrated in the Sutragarh area of \u200b\u200bShantipur.\u00a0 Sutragarh's Jagadhatri Puja is estimated to be more than 350 years old.\u00a0 All Jagadhatri Pratimas are still worshiped in the name of King Krishnachandra in this place.\u00a0 Various gods and goddesses were held in the center of Jagadhatri worship here.\u00a0(Kali, Santoshi Mata, Bharat Mata, Durga, Komolekamini, Annapurna, Narayan, Nataraj and others)\n\nJagadhatri Puja is held here for three days and after three days of worship, Pratima is Niranjan by performing a Luminous procession.\n\n==Notable people==\nNotable people from Shantipur include: [[Advaita Acharya]], [[Bijoy Krishna Goswami]][[Azizul Haque (educator)|, Sir Azizul Haque,]] [[Mohammad Mozammel Huq|Kabi Mohammed Mozammel Haque]], [[Krittibas Ojha|Kabi Krittibas Ojha]], [[Arun Chandra Guha|Kabi Jatindra Nath Sengupta, Kabi Karunanidhan Bandyopadhyay, Ahendra Choudhary, Arun Chandra Guha]], Nirmalendu Laheri, Pandit Lakshmi Kanta Maitra.<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE-->\n\n==Transport==\n[[Shantipur railway station]] is well connected by rail by EMU railway services running from [[Sealdah railway station]] (Main section).\n\nIt is also well connected with North and South Bengal by various State Transport Services.

High-explosive shells were filled with ''grade A'' TNT, which became preferred for other uses as industrial chemical capacity became available for removing [[xylene]] and similar [[hydrocarbon]]s from the toluene feedstock and other [[nitrotoluene]] [[isomer]] byproducts from the nitrating reactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Naval Ordnance|publisher=Lord Baltimore Press|year=1921|pages=49\u201352|author=Fairfield AP}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nIn industry, TNT is produced in a three-step process. First, [[toluene]] is [[nitration|nitrated]] with a mixture of [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]] to produce [[mononitrotoluene]] (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to [[dinitrotoluene]] (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an [[anhydrous]] mixture of nitric acid and [[oleum]]. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused.  After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products.  The rinse water from sulfitation is known as [[Pink water|red water]] and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chemistry and Technology of Explosives|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1964|isbn=978-0-08-010238-2|volume=1|pages=389\u201391|author=Urbanski T}}\n</ref>\n\nControl of [[nitrogen oxide]]s in feed nitric acid is very important because free [[nitrogen dioxide]] can result in oxidation of the methyl group of toluene.  This reaction is highly [[exothermic]] and carries with it the risk of a runaway reaction leading to an explosion.\n\nIn the laboratory, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is produced by a two-step process.  A nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono- and di-nitrotoluene isomers, with careful cooling to maintain temperature.  The nitrated toluenes are then separated, washed with dilute [[sodium bicarbonate]] to remove oxides of nitrogen, and then carefully nitrated with a mixture of [[fuming nitric acid]] and sulfuric acid.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nTNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with [[hydraulic fracturing]], a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.<ref name=\"recovery\">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=J.

TNT melts at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C (176&nbsp;\u00b0F), far below the temperature at which it will spontaneously detonate, allowing it to be poured or safely combined with other explosives.  TNT neither absorbs nor dissolves in water, which allows it to be used effectively in wet environments.  To detonate, TNT must be triggered by a pressure wave from a starter explosive, called an [[explosive booster]].\n\nAlthough blocks of TNT are available in various sizes (e.g. 250&nbsp;g, 500&nbsp;g, 1,000&nbsp;g), it is more commonly encountered in [[synergistic]] explosive blends comprising a variable percentage of TNT plus other ingredients.

There is evidence that TNT adversely affects male [[fertility]].<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp81.pdf Toxicological Profile for 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene]. atsdr.cdc.gov</ref> TNT is listed as a possible human [[carcinogen]], with carcinogenic effects demonstrated in animal experiments (rat), although effects upon humans so far amount to none [according to IRIS of March 15, 2000].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/8376 |website=www.nlm.nih.gov|title=2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene}}</ref> Consumption of TNT produces red [[urine]] through the presence of breakdown products and not blood as sometimes believed.<ref>{{Cite web | publisher = [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] | title=2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp81-c2.pdf | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nSome military testing grounds are contaminated with TNT. [[Wastewater]] from munitions programs including contamination of surface and [[groundwater|subsurface waters]] may be colored pink because of the presence of TNT. Such contamination, called \"[[pink water]]\", may be difficult and expensive to [[Environmental remediation|remedy]].\n\nTNT is prone to [[exudation]] of [[dinitrotoluene]]s and other isomers of trinitrotoluene. Even small quantities of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in [[shell (projectile)|projectiles]] containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the [[fuze]] screw thread can form ''fire channels'', increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tIQDn2uZz4C&pg=PA11|title=The Chemistry of Explosives|date=2004|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-640-9|pages=11\u2013|author=Akhavan J}}</ref> [[Calcium silicate]] is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islandgroup.com/military/explosives_additives.php |title=Explosive & Propellant Additives|work=islandgroup.com}}</ref>\n\n== Ecological impact ==\n\nBecause of its use in construction and demolition, TNT has become the most widely used explosive, and thus its toxicity is the most characterized and reported. Residual TNT from manufacture, storage, and use can pollute water, soil, [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].\n\nThe concentration of TNT in contaminated soil can reach 50 g/kg of soil, where the highest concentrations can be found on or near the surface.

Adsorption coefficient values have been shown to increase with an increase in the number of amino groups. Thus, adsorption of the TNT decomposition product 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DANT) was greater than that  for 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), which was greater than that for TNT.<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>   Lower adsorption coefficients for 2,6-DNT compared to 2,4-DNT can be attributed to the [[Steric effects|steric]] hindrance of the NO<sub>2</sub> group in the [[Arene substitution pattern|ortho position]].\n\nResearch has shown that in freshwater environments, with a high abundances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the adsorption of TNT and its transformation products to soils and sediments may be lower than observed in a saline environment, dominated by K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. Therefore, when considering the adsorption of TNT, the type of soil or sediment and the ionic composition and strength of the ground water are important factors.<ref name=\"Pennington_2002\">{{cite journal|date=February 2002|title=Environmental fate of explosives|journal=Thermochimica Acta|volume=384|issue=1\u20132|pages=163\u2013172|doi=10.1016/S0040-6031(01)00801-2|vauthors=Pennington JC, Brannon JM}}</ref>\n\nThe association constants for TNT and its degradation products with clays have been determined. Clay minerals have a significant effect on the adsorption of energetic compounds. Soil properties, such as organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity had significant impacts of the adsorption coefficients reported in the table below.\n\nAdditional studies have shown that the mobility of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower \"than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.\"<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>  Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/> The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from \"sorption and desorption [[Isothermal process|isotherm models]] determined with [[humic acids]], in aquifer sediments, and soils\".<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>  From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.<ref name = \"Esteve-Nunez_2001\"/>\n\nCompared to other explosives, TNT has a higher association constant with soil, meaning it adheres more with soil than with water. Conversely, other explosives, such as [[RDX]] and [[HMX]] with low association constants (ranging from 0.06 to 7.3 L/kg and 0 to 1.6 L/kg respectively) can move more rapidly in water.<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>\n\n=== Chemical breakdown ===\n\nTNT is a reactive molecule and is particularly prone to react with reduced components of sediments or [[photodegradation]] in the presence of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like [[photons]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]], or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic.\n\nSoils with high clay contents or small particle sizes and high [[Total organic carbon|total organic carbon content]] have been shown to promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include [[Reduction reaction|reduction]] of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.\n\nThe transformation of TNT is significantly enhanced under anaerobic conditions as well as under highly reducing conditions. TNT transformations in soils can occur both biologically and abiotically.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>\n\n[[Photolysis]] is a major process that impacts the transformation of energetic compounds. The alteration of a molecule in photolysis occurs in the presence of direct absorption of light energy by the transfer of energy from a photosensitized compound. [[Phototransformation]] of TNT \"results in the formation of [[nitrobenzene]]s, [[benzaldehyde]]s, azodicarboxylic acids, and [[nitrophenol]]s, as a result of the [[oxidation]] of [[methyl group]]s, reduction of [[nitro compound|nitro groups]], and dimer formation.\"<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>\n\nEvidence of the photolysis of TNT has been seen due to the color change to pink of the wastewaters when exposed to sunlight. Photolysis was more rapid in river water than in distilled water. Ultimately, photolysis affects the fate of TNT primarily in the aquatic environment but could also affect the reaction when exposed to sunlight on the soil surface.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>\n\n=== Biodegradation ===\n\nThe ligninolytic physiological phase and manganese peroxidase system of fungi can cause a very limited amount of mineralization of TNT in a liquid culture; though not in soil.

High-explosive shells were filled with ''grade A'' TNT, which became preferred for other uses as industrial chemical capacity became available for removing [[xylene]] and similar [[hydrocarbon]]s from the toluene feedstock and other [[nitrotoluene]] [[isomer]] byproducts from the nitrating reactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Naval Ordnance|publisher=Lord Baltimore Press|year=1921|pages=49\u201352|author=Fairfield AP}}</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nIn industry, TNT is produced in a three-step process. First, [[toluene]] is [[nitration|nitrated]] with a mixture of [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]] to produce [[mononitrotoluene]] (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to [[dinitrotoluene]] (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an [[anhydrous]] mixture of nitric acid and [[oleum]]. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused.  After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products.  The rinse water from sulfitation is known as [[Pink water|red water]] and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chemistry and Technology of Explosives|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1964|isbn=978-0-08-010238-2|volume=1|pages=389\u201391|author=Urbanski T}}\n</ref>\n\nControl of [[nitrogen oxide]]s in feed nitric acid is very important because free [[nitrogen dioxide]] can result in oxidation of the methyl group of toluene.  This reaction is highly [[exothermic]] and carries with it the risk of a runaway reaction leading to an explosion.\n\nIn the laboratory, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is produced by a two-step process.  A nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono- and di-nitrotoluene isomers, with careful cooling to maintain temperature.  The nitrated toluenes are then separated, washed with dilute [[sodium bicarbonate]] to remove oxides of nitrogen, and then carefully nitrated with a mixture of [[fuming nitric acid]] and sulfuric acid.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nTNT is one of the most commonly used explosives for military, industrial, and mining applications. TNT has been used in conjunction with [[hydraulic fracturing]], a process used to recover oil and gas from shale formations. The technique involves displacing and detonating nitroglycerin in hydraulically induced fractures followed by wellbore shots using pelletized TNT.<ref name=\"recovery\">{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=J.

TNT melts at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C (176&nbsp;\u00b0F), far below the temperature at which it will spontaneously detonate, allowing it to be poured or safely combined with other explosives.  TNT neither absorbs nor dissolves in water, which allows it to be used effectively in wet environments.  To detonate, TNT must be triggered by a pressure wave from a starter explosive, called an [[explosive booster]].\n\nAlthough blocks of TNT are available in various sizes (e.g. 250&nbsp;g, 500&nbsp;g, 1,000&nbsp;g), it is more commonly encountered in [[synergistic]] explosive blends comprising a variable percentage of TNT plus other ingredients.

The condensed phases (solid or liquid) show markedly lower activation energies of roughly 35 kcal/mol due to unique bimolecular decomposition routes at elevated densities.<ref>Furman et al. (2014), Decomposition of Condensed Phase Energetic Materials: Interplay between Uni- and Bimolecular Mechanisms, J. Am. Chem.

Because TNT has an excess of carbon, explosive mixtures with oxygen-rich compounds can yield more energy per kilogram than TNT alone.  During the 20th century, [[amatol]], a mixture of TNT with [[ammonium nitrate]] was a widely used military explosive.\n\nTNT can be detonated with a high velocity initiator or by efficient concussion.<ref>''[[Merck Index]]'', 13th Edition, '''9801'''</ref> For many years, TNT used to be the reference point for the [[Figure of Insensitivity]]. TNT had a rating of exactly 100 on the \"F of I\" scale.

During the [[World War I|First World War]], munition workers who handled the chemical found that their skin turned bright yellow, which resulted in their acquiring the nickname \"[[canary girls]]\" or simply \"canaries.\"\n\nPeople exposed to TNT over a prolonged period tend to experience [[anemia]] and abnormal [[liver]] functions. [[Blood]] and liver effects, [[spleen]] enlargement and other harmful effects on the [[immune system]] have also been found in animals that ingested or breathed trinitrotoluene. There is evidence that TNT adversely affects male [[fertility]].<ref>[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp81.pdf Toxicological Profile for 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene]. atsdr.cdc.gov</ref> TNT is listed as a possible human [[carcinogen]], with carcinogenic effects demonstrated in animal experiments (rat), although effects upon humans so far amount to none [according to IRIS of March 15, 2000].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/8376 |website=www.nlm.nih.gov|title=2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene}}</ref> Consumption of TNT produces red [[urine]] through the presence of breakdown products and not blood as sometimes believed.<ref>{{Cite web | publisher = [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] | title=2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp81-c2.pdf | accessdate = 2010-05-17}}</ref>\n\nSome military testing grounds are contaminated with TNT. [[Wastewater]] from munitions programs including contamination of surface and [[groundwater|subsurface waters]] may be colored pink because of the presence of TNT. Such contamination, called \"[[pink water]]\", may be difficult and expensive to [[Environmental remediation|remedy]].\n\nTNT is prone to [[exudation]] of [[dinitrotoluene]]s and other isomers of trinitrotoluene. Even small quantities of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in [[shell (projectile)|projectiles]] containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the [[fuze]] screw thread can form ''fire channels'', increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tIQDn2uZz4C&pg=PA11|title=The Chemistry of Explosives|date=2004|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-0-85404-640-9|pages=11\u2013|author=Akhavan J}}</ref> [[Calcium silicate]] is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islandgroup.com/military/explosives_additives.php |title=Explosive & Propellant Additives|work=islandgroup.com}}</ref>\n\n== Ecological impact ==\n\nBecause of its use in construction and demolition, TNT has become the most widely used explosive, and thus its toxicity is the most characterized and reported. Residual TNT from manufacture, storage, and use can pollute water, soil, [[atmosphere]], and [[biosphere]].\n\nThe concentration of TNT in contaminated soil can reach 50 g/kg of soil, where the highest concentrations can be found on or near the surface. In Sept. of 2001, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) declared TNT a pollutant whose removal is priority.<ref name=\"Esteve-Nunez_2001\">{{cite journal|year=2001|title=Biological degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene|journal=Microbiol.

Adsorption coefficient values have been shown to increase with an increase in the number of amino groups. Thus, adsorption of the TNT decomposition product 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene (2,4-DANT) was greater than that  for 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT), which was greater than that for TNT.<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>   Lower adsorption coefficients for 2,6-DNT compared to 2,4-DNT can be attributed to the [[Steric effects|steric]] hindrance of the NO<sub>2</sub> group in the [[Arene substitution pattern|ortho position]].\n\nResearch has shown that in freshwater environments, with a high abundances of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the adsorption of TNT and its transformation products to soils and sediments may be lower than observed in a saline environment, dominated by K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>. Therefore, when considering the adsorption of TNT, the type of soil or sediment and the ionic composition and strength of the ground water are important factors.<ref name=\"Pennington_2002\">{{cite journal|date=February 2002|title=Environmental fate of explosives|journal=Thermochimica Acta|volume=384|issue=1\u20132|pages=163\u2013172|doi=10.1016/S0040-6031(01)00801-2|vauthors=Pennington JC, Brannon JM}}</ref>\n\nThe association constants for TNT and its degradation products with clays have been determined. Clay minerals have a significant effect on the adsorption of energetic compounds. Soil properties, such as organic carbon content and cation exchange capacity had significant impacts of the adsorption coefficients reported in the table below.\n\nAdditional studies have shown that the mobility of TNT degradation products is likely to be lower \"than TNT in subsurface environments where specific adsorption to clay minerals dominates the sorption process.\"<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>  Thus, the mobility of TNT and its transformation products are dependent on the characteristics of the sorbent.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/> The mobility of TNT in groundwater and soil has been extrapolated from \"sorption and desorption [[Isothermal process|isotherm models]] determined with [[humic acids]], in aquifer sediments, and soils\".<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>  From these models, it is predicted that TNT has a low retention and transports readily in the environment.<ref name = \"Esteve-Nunez_2001\"/>\n\nCompared to other explosives, TNT has a higher association constant with soil, meaning it adheres more with soil than with water. Conversely, other explosives, such as [[RDX]] and [[HMX]] with low association constants (ranging from 0.06 to 7.3 L/kg and 0 to 1.6 L/kg respectively) can move more rapidly in water.<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>\n\n=== Chemical breakdown ===\n\nTNT is a reactive molecule and is particularly prone to react with reduced components of sediments or [[photodegradation]] in the presence of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like [[photons]], [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[ferrous|Fe<sup>2+</sup>]], or microbial communities, both oxic and anoxic.\n\nSoils with high clay contents or small particle sizes and high [[Total organic carbon|total organic carbon content]] have been shown to promote TNT transformation. Possible TNT transformations include [[Reduction reaction|reduction]] of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form [[dimer (chemistry)|dimer]]s. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.\n\nThe transformation of TNT is significantly enhanced under anaerobic conditions as well as under highly reducing conditions. TNT transformations in soils can occur both biologically and abiotically.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>\n\n[[Photolysis]] is a major process that impacts the transformation of energetic compounds. The alteration of a molecule in photolysis occurs in the presence of direct absorption of light energy by the transfer of energy from a photosensitized compound. [[Phototransformation]] of TNT \"results in the formation of [[nitrobenzene]]s, [[benzaldehyde]]s, azodicarboxylic acids, and [[nitrophenol]]s, as a result of the [[oxidation]] of [[methyl group]]s, reduction of [[nitro compound|nitro groups]], and dimer formation.\"<ref name = \"Pichtel_2012\"/>\n\nEvidence of the photolysis of TNT has been seen due to the color change to pink of the wastewaters when exposed to sunlight. Photolysis was more rapid in river water than in distilled water. Ultimately, photolysis affects the fate of TNT primarily in the aquatic environment but could also affect the reaction when exposed to sunlight on the soil surface.<ref name = \"Pennington_2002\"/>\n\n=== Biodegradation ===\n\nThe ligninolytic physiological phase and manganese peroxidase system of fungi can cause a very limited amount of mineralization of TNT in a liquid culture; though not in soil. An organism capable of the remediation of large amounts of TNT in soil has yet to be discovered.<ref name=\"pmid11131384\">{{cite journal|year=2000|title=Microbial degradation of explosives: biotransformation versus mineralization|journal=Appl.

Originally, it only had one outdoor platform. In 1878, the station was renamed ''Sch\u00f6nholz (Reinickendorf)''. In 1884, the station was renamed again to ''Sch\u00f6nholz-Reinickendorf''. In 1893, the outer platform was replaced by a central platform. At the same time, the Kremmen Railway was opened, making the station an interchange station. In 1896, the station got a reception building.\n\nBetween 1901 and 1903, the station would have been in the way of a new road, and in the course of this work the station was rebuilt{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. The old reception building was demolished. At the same time as Northern Railway got its own track pair, the Kremmen Railway was also separated, so the station was then served only by suburban trains.\n\nFrom June 5, 1925, the first electric trains operated on this route. As a result, the station became an [[S-Bahn]] station. With the electrification of the Kremmen Railway two years later, mixed operation with steam locomotives was ended.\n\nIn May 1938, the station was renamed ''Berlin-Sch\u00f6nholz''.\n\nIn 1945, there was no traffic for several weeks due to the ongoing war.\n\nOn January 9, 1984, management of the West Berlin S-Bahn was transferred from the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|German Reichsbahn]] to the [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|BVG]]. Both routes using the station were shut down and the station was closed. It was soon reopened on October 1, 1984, to serve the route to Frohnau. In 1995, the Kremmen Railway was also reopened, initially only to Tegel, and since 1998 to Hennigsdorf.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de/fahrplanundnetz/sbahnhof_anzeige.php?ID=136 Station information] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{coord|52.5714|N|13.3811|E|type:railwaystation_region:DE|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Schonholz}}\n[[Category:Berlin S-Bahn stations]]\n[[Category:Railway stations in Berlin]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Reinickendorf]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1877|Berlin Schonholz]]\n", "text_old": "{{Rough translation|1=German|listed=yes|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox station\n| name                = Berlin-Sch\u00f6nholz\n| native_name         = \n| native_name_lang    = de\n| symbol =  | symbol2 = \n| symbol_location     = de\n| type                = [[Railway station types in Germany|Bf]]\n| image               = S-Bahnhof Berlin-Sch\u00f6nholz.JPG\n| alt                 = \n| caption             = Platform\n| other_name          = \n| address             = \n| borough             = [[Reinickendorf (locality)|Reinickendorf]], [[Reinickendorf|Reinickendorf borough]], Berlin\n| country             = Germany\n| coordinates         = \n| line                = [[Berlin Northern Railway|Northern Railway]] ({{\u00d6PNV Berlin|S1|10}}, {{\u00d6PNV Berlin|S26|10}})<br/>[[Kremmen Railway]] ({{\u00d6PNV Berlin|S25|10}})\n| platforms           = \n| tracks              = \n| connections         = \n| code                = {{Deutsche Bahn station codes|code=0560|ds100=BSNL|ibnr=|category=4}}\n| zone                = {{\u00d6PNV Berlin|VBB}}: Berlin B/5656<ref>{{cite web |title=Der VBB-Tarif: Aufteilung des Verbundgebietes in Tarifwaben und Tarifbereiche |url=https://www.swp-potsdam.de/content/verkehr/pdf_7/vbb_wabenkarte_und_tarifbereiche.pdf |website=Verkehrsbetrieb Potsdam |publisher=[[Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg]] |accessdate=25 November 2019 |date=1 January 2017}}</ref>\n| architect           = \n| architectural_style = \n| opened              = {{Start date and age|1877|07|10|df=y}}\n| electrified         = {{Start date and age|1925|06|05|df=y}}\n| former              = 1877-1878 Reinickendorf<br/>1878-1884 Sch\u00f6nholz (Reinickendorf)<br/>1884-1938 Sch\u00f6nholz-Reinickendorf\n| years               = 1903 \n| events              = current building erected\n| years2              = 1945, late April - June 10\n| events2             = operation interrupted\n| years3              = 1984, 9 January - 30 September \n| events3             = operation interrupted\n| passengers          = \n| pass_year           = \n| website             =\n| map_type            = Berlin\n| map_caption         = Location within Berlin\n| embedded            = {{Infobox mapframe\n| stroke-colour       = #C60C30\n| stroke-width        = 3\n| marker              = rail-underground\n| marker-colour       = #009D58\n| zoom                = 15\n}}\n| services            =\n{{s-rail|title=SBB}}\n{{s-line|system=SBB|line=S1|previous=Wilhelmsruh|next=Wollankstra\u00dfe|type=North|type2=South}}\n{{s-line|system=SBB|line=S25|previous=Alt-Reinickendorf|next=Wollankstra\u00dfe|type=North|type2=South}}\n{{s-line|system=SBB|line=S26|previous=Wilhelmsruh|next=Wollankstra\u00dfe|type=North|type2=South}}\n}}\n\n'''Berlin-Sch\u00f6nholz''' ({{lang-de|Bahnhof Berlin-Sch\u00f6nholz}}) is a [[railway station]] in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].
