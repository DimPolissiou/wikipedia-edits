He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], situated 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home.

Auden]] and writer [[Chester Kallman]] worked on the libretto. The opera premiered in 1951 and marks the final work during Stravinsky's neoclassical period.{{sfn|Whiting|2005|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nStravinsky befriended American conductor [[Robert Craft]] while composing ''The Rake's Progress''. Craft later became Stravinsky's personal assistant and close friend, who encouraged Stravinsky to compose serial music. This began Stravinsky's third and final distinct musical period, the [[Serialism|serial]] (or [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve-tone]]) period, which lasted until his death.{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=40}}\n\nIn January 1962, during his tour's stop in Washington, D.C., Stravinsky attended a dinner at the White House with President [[John F.

The two-minute work took the composer two days to write.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=488}}\n\nBy early 1964, the long periods of travel had started to affect Stravinsky's health. His case of [[polycythemia]] had worsened and his friends had noticed that his movements and speech had slowed.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=488}} In 1965, Stravinsky agreed to have [[David Oppenheim (clarinetist)|David Oppenheim]] produce a documentary film about himself for the [[CBS]] network. It involved a film crew following the composer at home and on tour that year, paying him $10,000 for the production.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=501}} The documentary includes Stravisky's visit to Les Tilleuls, the house in Clarens, Switzerland, where he wrote the majority of ''The Rite of Spring''. The crew asked Soviet authorities to film Stravinsky returning to his hometown of Ustilug, but the request was denied.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|pp=503\u2013504}} In 1966, Stravinsky completed his last major work, the ''[[Requiem Canticles]]''.{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=41}}\n\nIn February 1967, Stravinsky and Craft directed their own concert in Miami, Florida, which marked the composer's first in the state. By this time, Stravinsky's typical performance fee had amounted to $10,000. Then, upon doctor's orders, his subsequent bookings that required him to fly were cancelled.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=528}} An exception to this was a concert at [[Massey Hall]] in Toronto, Canada in May 1967, where he conducted the less physically demanding ''Pulcinella'' suite with the [[Toronto Symphony Orchestra]]. He had become increasingly frail and for the only time in his career, Stravinsky conducted while sitting down. It was his final performance as conductor in his lifetime.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=529}} While backstage at the venue, Stravinsky informed to Craft that he believed to have suffered from a stroke.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=528}} In August 1967, Stravinsky was hospitalised in Hollywood for bleeding stomach ulcers and thrombosis which required a blood transfusion. In his diary, Craft wrote that he spoon fed the ailing composer and held his hand: \"He says the warmth diminishes the pain.\"{{sfn|White|1979|p=154}}\n\nBy 1968, Stravinsky had recovered enough to resume touring across the US with him in the audience while Craft took to the conductor's post for the majority of the concerts.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In May 1968, Stravinsky completed the piano arrangement of two songs by Austrian composer [[Hugo Wolf]] for a small orchestra.{{sfn|White|1979|p=155}} In October Stravinsky, Vera, and Craft travelled to Zurich, Switzerland to sort business matters with Stravinsky's family. While there, Stravinsky's son Theodore handed the manuscript of ''The Rite of Spring'' where Stravinsky signed it and gave it to Vera.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|pp=542\u2013543}} The three considered relocating to Switzerland as they had become increasingly less fond of Hollywood, but they decided against it and returned to the US.{{sfn|Walsh|2006|p=544}}\n\n====Final years and death====\n[[File:Stravinskygrave.jpg|thumb|upright|Stravinsky's grave on [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele Island]]]]\nIn October 1969, after close to three decades in California and being denied to travel overseas by his doctors due to ill health, Stravinsky and Vera secured a two-year lease for a luxury three bedroom apartment in [[Jumeirah Essex House|Essex House]] in New York City.

His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, [[Amsterdam]] and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as [[Coco Chanel]]. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer [[Paul Morand]] in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later.{{sfn|Morand|1976|pp=121\u201324}} The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=439}} Chanel's fashion house avers there is no evidence that any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred.<ref>[http://www.expatica.com/ch/news/swiss-news/Fact_or_fiction-Chanel_Stravinsky-affair-curtains-Cannes--_52910.html Fact-or-fiction Chanel-Stravinsky affair curtains Cannes].

Baptized at birth, he later rebelled against the Church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1969|p=198}} Throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from Christianity and it was not until he reached his early forties that he experienced a spiritual crisis. After befriending a Russian Orthodox priest, Father Nicholas, after his move to [[Nice]] in 1924, he reconnected with his faith. He rejoined the Russian Orthodox Church and afterwards remained a committed Christian.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|p=51}} Robert Craft noted that Stravinsky prayed daily, before and after composing, and also prayed when facing difficulty.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1966|pp=172\u201375}} Towards the end of his life, he was no longer able to attend church services. In his late seventies, Stravinsky said:<blockquote>I cannot now evaluate the events that, at the end of those thirty years, made me discover the necessity of religious belief. I was not reasoned into my disposition. Though I admire the structured thought of theology ([[St Anselm|Anselm]]'s proof in the ''[[Fides quaerens intellectum|Fides Quaerens Intellectum]]'', for instance) it is to religion no more than counterpoint exercises are to music. I do not believe in bridges of reason or, indeed, in any form of extrapolation in religious matters. ... I can say, however, that for some years before my actual \"conversion\", a mood of acceptance had been cultivated in me by a reading of the Gospels and by other religious literature.<ref>{{harvnb|Copeland|1982|p=565}}, quoting {{harvnb|Stravinsky and Craft|1962|pp=63\u201364}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Robert Delaunay - Portrait of Stravinsky.tif|thumb|left|''Portrait of Stravinsky'' (1918) by [[Robert Delaunay]], in the [[Garman Ryan Collection]] ]]\nIf Stravinsky's stated intention was \"to send them all to hell\",<ref>{{harvtxt|Wenborn|1985|p=17}} alludes to this comment, without giving a specific source.</ref> then he may have rated the [[The Rite of Spring#Premiere|1913 premiere of ''The Rite'' ''of Spring'']] as a success: it resulted in one of history's most famous [[classical music riot|classical music riots]], and Stravinsky referred to it on several occasions in his autobiography as a ''{{Lang|fr|scandale}}''.{{sfn|Stravinsky|1936|loc=80}} There were reports of fistfights in the audience and the need for a police presence during the second act.

In 1923, [[Erik Satie]] wrote an article about Igor Stravinsky in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.{{sfn|Satie|1923}} Satie had met Stravinsky for the first time in 1910. In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers. That was exactly what [[Jean Cocteau]] did when he commented deprecatingly on Stravinsky in his 1918 book, {{lang|fr|Le Coq et l'Arlequin}}.{{sfn|Volta|1989|loc=first pages of chapter on contemporaries}}{{Page needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in 1923:\n<blockquote>All the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentricity that was one of the legacies of the war....

Bach]], conceding that, \"there is no denying the greatness of Stravinsky. It is just that he is not great enough.\"{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|p=330}} Blitzstein's [[Marxism|Marxist]] position was that Stravinsky's wish to \"divorce music from other streams of life\", which is \"symptomatic of an escape from reality\", resulted in a \"loss of stamina\", naming specifically ''[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollo]]'', the [[Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra|Capriccio]], and ''[[Le baiser de la f\u00e9e|Le Baiser de la f\u00e9e]]''.{{sfn|Blitzstein|1935|pp=346\u201347}}\n\nThe composer [[Constant Lambert]] described pieces such as ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' as containing \"essentially cold-blooded abstraction\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|p=94}} Lambert continued, \"melodic fragments in {{lang|fr|Histoire du Soldat}} are completely meaningless themselves. They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W. Adorno]] described Stravinsky as an acrobat and spoke of [[Disorganized schizophrenia|hebephrenic]] and psychotic traits in several of Stravinsky's works. Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial. This trick, however, soon exhausts itself.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=195}} Adorno maintained that the \"rhythmic procedures closely resemble the schema of catatonic conditions. In certain schizophrenics, the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words, following the decay of the ego.\"{{sfn|Adorno|1973|p=178}}\n\nStravinsky's reputation in Russia and the USSR rose and fell. Performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962, the year [[Nikita Khrushchev]] invited him to the USSR for an official state visit. In 1972, an official proclamation by the Soviet Minister of Culture, [[Yekaterina Furtseva]], ordered Soviet musicians to \"study and admire\" Stravinsky's music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence.{{specify |reason=what type of offence? |date=November 2017}}{{sfn|Karlinsky|1985|p=282}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/tempo/article/books/9671C20C4B0030BEAAFA07BDCD28BE84|title=Books -|journal=Tempo|issue=118|pages=39\u201340|accessdate=25 November 2017|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S004029820002845X|year=1976}}</ref>\n<!--During his lifetime, Stravinsky was often criticized for the apparently abrupt changes in style from one work to another.

He is widely considered one of the most important and influential [[20th-century classical music|composers of the 20th century]].\n\nStravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. He first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the [[impresario]] [[Serge Diaghilev]] and first performed in Paris by Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]: ''[[The Firebird]]'' (1910), ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' (1911), and ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913). The latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for Stravinsky's enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design. His \"Russian phase\", which continued with works such as ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'', ''[[L'Histoire du soldat]]'' and ''[[Les Noces]]'', was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassicism]]. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ([[concerto grosso]], [[fugue]] and [[symphony]]) and drew from earlier styles, especially those of the 18th century. In the 1950s, Stravinsky adopted [[serialism|serial]] procedures. His compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output: rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two- or three-note [[Cell (music)|cells]] and clarity of [[Musical form|form]], and of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life, 1882\u20131901===\nStravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 in the town of [[Lomonosov, Russia|Oranienbaum]] on the southern coast of the [[Gulf of Finland]], situated 25 miles west of [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1101}}{{sfn|White|1979|p=4}} His father, [[Fyodor Stravinsky|Fyodor Ignatievich Stravinsky]] (1843\u20131902), was an established [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] opera singer in the [[National Opera of Ukraine|Kyiv Opera]] and the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] in Saint Petersburg and his mother, Anna Kirillovna Stravinskaya (''n\u00e9e'' Kholodovskaya; 1854\u20131939), a native of [[Kiev]], was one of four daughters of a high-ranking official in the Kiev Ministry of Estates.

By age fifteen, Stravinsky had mastered [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] and finished a piano reduction of a string quartet by [[Alexander Glazunov]], who reportedly considered Stravinsky unmusical and thought little of his skills.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=564}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pupil of Rimsky-Korsakov and first compositions, 1901\u20131909===\n[[File:Stravinsky Igor Postcard-1910.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Stravinsky in 1903]]\nDespite Stravinsky's enthusiasm and ability in music, his parents expected him to study law and, at first, he took to the subject. In 1901, he enrolled at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] studying criminal law and legal philosophy, but attendance at lectures was optional and he estimated that he turned up to fewer than fifty in his four years of study.{{sfn|Dubal|2001|p=565}} In the summer of 1902, Stravinsky stayed with composer and orchestrator [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and his family in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, after he had met Vladimir, the youngest son of Rimsky-Korsakov and a fellow pupil at the University of Saint Petersburg, and wished to meet his father about his musical aspirations. Rimsky-Korsakov, arguably the leading Russian composer at this time, suggested to Stravinsky that he should not enter the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]] but continue private lessons in theory.{{sfn|White|1979|p=8}}\n\nBy the time of his father's death from cancer in 1902, Stravinsky was spending more time studying music than law.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} His decision to pursue music full time was helped when the university was closed for two months in 1905 in the aftermath of [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], which prevented him from taking his final law exams.

In February of that year, both were performed in Saint Petersburg at a concert that marked a turning point in Stravinsky's career. In the audience was [[Serge Diaghilev]], a Russian impresario and owner of the [[Ballets Russes]] who was struck with Stravinsky's compositions. He wished to stage a mix of Russian opera and ballet for the 1910 season in Paris, among them a new ballet from fresh talent that was based on the Russian fairytale of the [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Firebird]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} After [[Anatoly Liadov]] was given the task of composing the score, he informed Diaghilev that he needed about one year to complete it.{{sfn|White|1979|p=16}} Diaghilev then asked the 28-year-old Stravinsky, who had provided satisfactory orchestrations for him for the previous season at short notice and agreed to compose a full score.{{sfn|White|1979|p=15}} At 50 minutes in length, ''[[The Firebird]]'' was revised by Stravinsky for concert performance in 1911, 1919, and 1945.\n\n''The Firebird'' premiered at the [[Palais Garnier|Opera de Paris]] on 25 June 1910 to widespread critical acclaim and Stravinsky became an overnight sensation.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|pp=142\u201343}}{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=140}}{{sfn|Whiting|2005|p=30}} As his wife was expecting their third child, the Stravinskys spent the summer in [[La Baule-Escoublac|La Baule]] in western France.

The result was ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', based the Russian folk tale featuring the [[Petrushka|titular character]], a puppet, who falls in love with another, a ballerina. Though it failed to capture the immediate reception that ''The Firebird'' had following its premiere at [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in June 1911, the production continued Stravinsky's success.\n\nIt was Stravinsky's third ballet for Diaghilev, ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', that caused a sensation among critics, fellow composers, and concertgoers. Based on an original idea, the production features a series of primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. Stravinsky's score contained many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. The radical nature of the music and choreography caused a near-riot at its premiere at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] on 29 May 1913.\n\nShortly after the premiere, Stravinsky contracted [[typhoid]] from eating bad oysters and he was confined to a Paris nursing home. He left in July 1913 and returned to Ustilug.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=100, 102}} For the rest of the summer he focused on his first opera, ''[[The Nightingale (opera)|The Nightingale]]'' (''Le Rossignol''), based on the [[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|same-titled story]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], which he had started in 1908.{{sfn|V. Stravinsky and Craft|1978|pp=111\u201314}} On 15 January 1914, Stravinsky and Nosenko had their fourth child, Marie Mil\u00e8ne (or Maria Milena). After her delivery, Nosenko was discovered to have [[tuberculosis]] and was confined to a [[sanatorium]] in [[Leysin]] in the Alps. Stravinsky took up residence nearby, where he completed ''The Nightingale''.{{sfn|Walsh|2000|p=224}}{{sfn|V.

For a while, he maintained a circle of contacts and [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]] friends from Russia, but he eventually found that this did not sustain his intellectual and professional life. He was drawn to the growing cultural life of Los Angeles, especially during World War II, when so many writers, musicians, composers and conductors settled in the area: these included [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[George Balanchine]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]]. [[Bernard Holland]] claimed Stravinsky was especially fond of British writers, who visited him in Beverly Hills, \"like [[W. H. Auden]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[Dylan Thomas]].

Hogarth's drawings, which told the story of a London man who lost his money and became a drunk, was an idea Stravinsky found attractive as an opera. American poet [[W. H.

The first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was ''In Memoriam Dylan Thomas'' (1954). ''[[Agon (ballet)|Agon]]'' (1954\u201357) was the first of his works to include a twelve-tone series and {{lang|la|[[Canticum Sacrum]]}} (1955) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a [[tone row]]<!-- (\"Surge, aquilo\") -->.{{sfn|Straus|2001|p=4}} Stravinsky expanded his use of dodecaphony in works such as ''[[Threni (Stravinsky)|Threni]]'' (1958) and ''[[A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer]]'' (1961), which are based on biblical texts,{{sfn|White|1979|p=510}} and ''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'' (1962), which mixes brief biblical texts from the [[Book of Genesis]] with passages from the [[York Mystery Plays|York]] and [[Chester Mystery Plays]].{{sfn|White|1979|p=517}}\n\n==Innovation and influence==\nStravinsky has been called \"one of music's truly epochal innovators\".<ref name=\"AMG\">AMG 2008.

This is where notes are subtracted or added to a motif without regard to the consequent changes in metre. A similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century, for example in the music of [[Cipriano de Rore]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Orlandus Lassus]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]] and [[Giovanni de Macque]], music with which Stravinsky exhibited considerable familiarity.{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1960|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nThe ''Rite of Spring'' is notable for its relentless use of [[ostinato|ostinati]], for example in the eighth-note ostinato on strings accented by eight [[French horn|horns]] in the section \"Augurs of Spring (Dances of the Young Girls)\".

Stravinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm, especially in the ''Rite of Spring'' (1913).{{sfn|Simon|2007}} According to the composer [[Philip Glass]], \"the idea of pushing the rhythms across the bar lines [...] led the way [...].

The texts and literary sources for his work began with a period of interest in [[Folklore|Russian folklore]], which progressed to classical authors and the [[Roman Rite|Latin liturgy]] and moved on to contemporary France ([[Andr\u00e9 Gide]], in ''[[Pers\u00e9phone (Stravinsky)|Persephone]]'') and eventually English literature, including [[W.

Not only was he the principal composer for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, but he also collaborated with [[Pablo Picasso]] (''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', 1920), [[Jean Cocteau]] (''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'', 1927), and [[George Balanchine]] ({{lang|fr|[[Apollo (ballet)|Apollon musag\u00e8te]]}}, 1928).

In the published article, Satie argued that measuring the \"greatness\" of an artist by comparing him to other artists, as if speaking about some \"truth\", is illusory and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers.

They are merely successions of notes that can conveniently be divided into groups of three, five, and seven and set against other mathematical groups\" and he described the cadenza for solo drums as \"musical purity ... achieved by a species of musical castration\". He compared Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" to [[Gertrude Stein]]'s 'Everyday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday' (\"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\", 1922), \"whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\".{{sfn|Lambert|1936|pp=101\u201305}}\n\nIn his 1949 book ''Philosophy of Modern Music'', [[Theodor W.

Contrary to a common misconception, Adorno didn't believe the hebephrenic and psychotic imitations that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault, as he pointed out in a postscript that he added later to his book. Adorno's criticism of Stravinsky is more concerned with the \"transition to positivity\" Adorno found in his neoclassical works.{{sfn|Adorno|2006|p=167}} Part of the composer's error, in Adorno's view, was his neoclassicism,{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=206\u201309}} but of greater importance was his music's \"pseudomorphism of painting\", playing off {{lang|fr|le temps espace}} (time-space) rather than {{lang|fr|le temps dur\u00e9e}} (time-duration) of [[Henri Bergson]].{{sfn|Adorno|1973|pp=191\u201393}} According to Adorno, \"one trick characterizes all of Stravinsky's formal endeavors: the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus tableau and to present time complexes as though they were spatial.

As a conductor of his own music, he recorded primarily for [[Columbia Records]], beginning in 1928 with a performance of the original suite from ''The Firebird'' and concluding in 1967 with the 1945 suite from the same ballet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-igor-stravinsky.org/web/en/miniatures.html |title=Miniature masterpieces |publisher=Fondation Igor Stravinsky |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> In the late 1940s he made several recordings for [[RCA Victor]] at the [[Republic Studios]] in Los Angeles. Although most of his recordings were made with studio musicians, he also worked with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Cleveland Orchestra]], the [[CBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the Bavarian Broadcasting Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Stravinsky appeared on several telecasts, including the 1962 world premiere of ''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'' on [[CBS Television]]. Although he made an appearance, the actual performance was conducted by Robert Craft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/opera/moreDetails.asp?musicID=7635 |title=Igor Stravinsky \u2013 Flood \u2013 Opera |publisher=Boosey.com |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> Numerous films and videos of the composer have been preserved.\n\nStravinsky published a number of books throughout his career, almost always with the aid of a (sometimes uncredited) collaborator. In his 1936 autobiography, ''Chronicle of My Life'', which was written with the help of [[Walter Nouvel]], Stravinsky included his well-known statement that \"music is, by its very nature, essentially powerless to express anything at all.\"{{sfn|Stravinsky|1936|pp=91\u201392}} With [[Alexis Roland-Manuel]] and [[Pyotr Suvchinsky|Pierre Souvtchinsky]], he wrote his 1939\u201340 [[Harvard University]] [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]], which were delivered in French and first collected under the title {{lang|fr|Po\u00e9tique musicale}} in 1942 and then translated in 1947 as ''Poetics of Music''.<ref>The names of uncredited collaborators are given in {{harvnb|Walsh|2001}}.</ref> In 1959, several interviews between the composer and Robert Craft were published as ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky'',{{sfn|Stravinsky and Craft|1959}} which was followed by a further five volumes over the following decade.
