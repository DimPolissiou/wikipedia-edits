Conversational or two-way media is a key characteristic of so-called [[Web 2.0]] which encourages the publishing of one's own content and commenting on other people's content.\n\nThe role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of [[New media|New Media]], and an ever-growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities, especially on the Internet to create independent content. Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds, artists, techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media.<ref>Jenkins, Henry (SODA), \"Convergence Culture\", New York University Press, New York</ref> The active, participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media, tools and applications, and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences.\n\nThe [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has defined three central schools for UGC:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/14/38393115.pdf|title=Working Party on the Information Economy - PARTICIPATIVE WEB: USER-CREATED CONTENT}}</ref>\n\n# '''Publication requirement:''' While UGC could be made by a user and never published online or elsewhere, we focus here on the work that is published in some context, be it on a publicly accessible website or on a page on a social networking site only accessible to a select group of people (e.g., fellow university students). This is a useful way to exclude email, two-way instant messages and the like.\n# '''Creative effort:''' Creative effort was put into creating the work or adapting existing works to construct a new one; i.e. users must add their own value to the work. UGC often also has a collaborative element to it, as is the case with websites which users can edit collaboratively. For example, merely copying a portion of a television show and posting it to an online video website (an activity frequently seen on the UGC sites) would not be considered UGC. If a user uploads his/her photographs, however, expresses his/her thoughts in a blog, or creates a new music video, this could be considered UGC. Yet the minimum amount of creative effort is hard to define and depends on the context.\n# '''Creation outside of professional routines and practices:''' User-generated content is generally created outside of professional routines and practices. It often does not have an institutional or a commercial market context. In extreme cases, UGC may be produced by non-professionals without the expectation of profit or remuneration. Motivating factors include: connecting with peers, achieving a certain level of fame, notoriety, or prestige, and the desire to express oneself.\n\nIt is important to have an objective before attempting to become part of the UGC/social networking environment. For example, companies may ask users to post their reviews directly to their Facebook page. This could end up disastrous if a user makes a comment that steers people away from the product.<ref>{{cite web|last1=IAB|title=IAB Status Platform Report|url=http://www.iab.net/media/file/2008_ugc_platform.pdf|website=IAB.NET}}</ref>\n\nMere [[copy & paste]] or [[hyperlink]]ing could also be seen as user-generated self-expression. The action of linking to a work or copying a work could in itself motivate the creator, express the taste of the person linking or copying. [[Digg|Digg.com]], [[StumbleUpon|StumbleUpon.com]], and leaptag.com are good examples of where such linkage to work happens. The culmination of such linkages could very well identify the tastes of a person in the community and make that person unique.\n\nBriefly User-Generated Content occurs when a product's customers create and disseminate online ideas about a product or the firm that markets it. These ideas are often in the form of text but also come in other forms such as music, photos, or videos. UGC has three key characteristics: (1) The contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm that sells this product; (2) it is creative in nature and the user adds something new; (3) it is posted online and generally accessible.\n\n== Defining Characteristics of User-Generated Content (UGC) ==\n1.) The contribution is by the users of a product rather than the firm that sells the product.\n\n2.) These contributions are somewhat creative in nature and the user adds something new to what has been done before.\n\n3.) These ideas and contributions are posted online and are generally accessible to everyone.\n\n4.) User Generated Content helps the brand to create a strong base of engaging users with them which also helps them get newer ideas for product development and expansion.\n\n== Media pluralism ==\n{{Main|Media pluralism}}\nAccording to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[petabyte]]s was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.<ref>Cisco Systems. 201.

In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012. This corresponded to a progressive diversification of content and increase in contributions in languages other than English. In 2017, less than 12 per cent of Wikipedia content was in English, down from 18 per cent in 2012.<ref>Wikimedia Foundation. 2017. Wikipedia Statistics. Available at https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm.</ref> Graham, Straumann, and Hogan say that increase in the availability and diversity of content has not radically changed the structures and processes for the production of knowledge. For example, while content on Africa has dramatically increased, a significant portion of this content has continued to be produced by contributors operating from North America and Europe, rather than from Africa itself.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping Participation in Wikipedia.|last=Graham|first=Mark|last2=Staumann|first2=Ralph K.|last3=Hogan|first3=Bernie|publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers 105 (6): 1158\u20131178.|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe massive, multi-volume [[Oxford English Dictionary]] was exclusively composed of user-generated content. In 1857, [[Richard Chenevix Trench]] of the [[London Philological Society]] sought public contributions from throughout the English-speaking world for the creation of the first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].<ref>{{Citation|last=tvochannel|title=Simon Winchester on his book The Meaning of Everything|date=2012-06-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3SmOsbLays|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref>  As Simon Winchester recounts:\n<blockquote>\nSo what we're going to do, if I have your agreement that we're going to produce such a dictionary, is that we're going to send out invitations, were going to send these invitations to every library, every school, every university, every book shop that we can identify throughout the English-speaking world... everywhere where English is spoken or read with any degree of enthusiasm, people will be invited to contribute words. And the point is, the way they do it, the way they will be asked and instructed to do it, is to read voraciously and whenever they see a word, whether it's a preposition or a sesquipedalian monster, they are to... if it interests them and if where they read it, they see it in a sentence that illustrates the way that that word is used, offers the meaning of the day to that word, then they are to write it on a slip of paper... the top left-hand side you write the word, the chosen word, the catch word, which in this case is 'twilight'. Then the quotation, the quotation illustrates the meaning of the word. And underneath it, the citation, were it came from, whether it was printed or whether it was in manuscript... and then the reference, the volume, the page and so on... and send these slips of paper, these slips are the key to the making of this dictionary, in to the headquarters of the dictionary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvo.org//transcript/883597/video/archive/big-ideas/simon-winchester-on-his-book-the-meaning-of-everything|title=Transcript: Simon Winchester on his book The Meaning of Everything - Jul 23, 2005 - TVO.org|website=www.tvo.org}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn the following decades, hundreds of thousands of contributions were sent to the editors.\n\nIn the 1990s several electronic [[bulletin board systems]] were based on user-generated content. Some of these systems have been converted into websites, including the film information site [[IMDb]] which started as ''rec.arts.movies'' in 1990. With the growth of the [[World Wide Web]] the focus moved to websites, several of which were based on user-generated content, including [[Wikipedia]] (2001) and [[Flickr]] (2004).\n\nUser-generated [[Internet video]] was popularized by [[YouTube]], an [[online video platform]] founded by [[Chad Hurley]], [[Jawed Karim]] and [[Steve Chen]] in April 2005. It enabled the [[video streaming]] of [[MPEG-4 AVC]] (H.264) user-generated content from anywhere on the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name=\"Matthew\">{{cite book |last1=Matthew |first1=Crick |title=Power, Surveillance, and Culture in YouTube\u2122's Digital Sphere |date=2016 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=9781466698567 |pages=36\u20137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-FmCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36}}</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC]] set up a pilot user-generated content team in April 2005 with 3 staff. In the wake of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield oil depot fire]], the team was made permanent and was expanded, reflecting the arrival in the mainstream of the [[citizen journalist]]. After the Buncefield disaster the BBC received over 5,000 photos from viewers. The BBC does not normally pay for content generated by its viewers.\n\nIn 2006 [[CNN]] launched [[CNN iReport]], a project designed to bring user-generated news content to CNN. Its rival [[Fox News Channel]] launched its project to bring in user-generated news, similarly titled \"uReport\". This was typical of major television news organisations in 2005\u20132006, who realised, particularly in the wake of the London 7 July bombings, that [[citizen journalism]] could now become a significant part of broadcast news.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> [[Sky News]], for example, regularly solicits for photographs and video from its viewers.\n\nUser-generated content was featured in ''Time'' magazine's 2006 [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]], in which the person of the year was \"you\", meaning all of the people who contribute to user-generated media, including YouTube, Wikipedia and [[MySpace]].<ref name=\"TIME\"/> A precursor to user-generated content uploaded on YouTube was ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|title=Converging Media|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780199342303|page=140|edition=4}}</ref>\n\n==Motivation for creating UGC==\nWhile the benefit derived from user-generated content for the content host is clear, the benefit to the contributor is less direct. There are various theories behind the motivation for contributing user-generated content, ranging from altruistic, to social, to materialistic. Due to the high value of user-generated content, many sites use incentives to encourage their generation. These incentives can be generally categorized into implicit incentives and explicit incentives.<ref name=\"TouunaGroup\">Toluna:{{cite web|url=http://www.toluna-group.com/files/en/Whitepapers/Web%20Incentives%20Whitepaper.pdf|title=Mixing Financial, Social and Fun Incentives for Social Voting|accessdate=3 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709193004/http://www.toluna-group.com/files/en/Whitepapers/Web%20Incentives%20Whitepaper.pdf|archive-date=9 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n# '''Implicit incentives:''' These incentives are not based on anything tangible. Social incentives are the most common form of implicit incentives. These incentives allow the user to feel good as an active member of the community. These can include relationship between users, such as  [[Facebook]]'s friends, or [[Twitter]]'s followers. Social incentives also include the ability to connect users with others, as seen on the sites already mentioned as well as sites like YouTube, which allow users to share media from their lives with others. Users also share the experiences that they have while using a particular product/service. This will improve the customer experience as they can make informed decisions in buying a product, which makes them smart buyers. Other common social incentives are status, badges or levels within the site, something a user earns when they reach a certain level of participation which may or may not come with additional privileges. [[Yahoo! Answers]] is an example of this type of social incentive. Another social incentive is social comparison. Being aware of the user's own ranking or level among the whole community could affect the behavior as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yan|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph|last4=Li|first4=Sherry Xin|date=September 2010|title=Social Comparisons and Contributions to Online Communities: A Field Experiment on MovieLens|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.4.1358|journal=American Economic Review|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1358\u20131398|doi=10.1257/aer.100.4.1358|issn=0002-8282}}</ref> Social incentives cost the host site very little and can catalyze vital growth; however, their very nature requires a sizable existing community before it can function. Social incentive can also be split into identification and integration. The identification motivation has strong external standardization and internalization of behavioral goals, such as social identity, that is, users will follow some subjective norms and images to constrain and practice their behaviors. The integration has the strongest external standardization and goal internalization, and the agent often integrates its actual actions with the subjective norms of the environment, so it has the effect of self-restraint and self-realization, such as the sense of belonging. [[Naver|Naver Knowledge-iN]] is another example of this type of social incentive. It uses a point system to encourage users to answer more questions by receiving points.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nam|first=Kevin Kyung|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2009|title=Questions in, knowledge in?: a study of naver's question answering community|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1518701.1518821|journal=Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI 09|language=en|location=Boston, MA, USA|publisher=ACM Press|pages=779|doi=10.1145/1518701.1518821|isbn=978-1-60558-246-7}}</ref>\n# '''Explicit incentives:''' These incentives refer to tangible rewards. Explicit incentives can be split into externality and projection. External motivation is more inclined to economic and material incentives, such as the reward for engaging in a task, which has little internalization and lacks relevant external norms and constraints. Examples include financial payment, entry into a contest, a voucher, a coupon, or frequent traveler miles. Direct explicit incentives are easily understandable by most and have immediate value regardless of the community size; sites such as the Canadian shopping platform [[Wishabi]] and [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] both use this type of financial incentive in slightly different ways to encourage user participation. The projective agent has some external norms, but the degree of internalization is not enough, that is, it has not been fully recognized by the actor. The drawback to explicit incentives is that they may cause the user to be subject to the over justification effect, eventually believing the only reason for the participating is for the explicit incentive. This reduces the influence of the other form of social or altruistic motivation, making it increasingly costly for the content host to retain long-term contributors.<ref name=\"HOPLA Online\">HOPLA Online:{{cite web |url=https://hopla.online/blog/user-generated-content-moderation-brand-trust/|title=User-generated Content Moderation: Shaping Brand Trust and Recognition|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n\n==Ranking and assessment==\nThe distribution of UGC across the [[World Wide Web|Web]] provides a high volume data source that is accessible for [[Data analysis|analysis]], and offers utility in enhancing the experiences of [[end user]]s. [[Social science]] research can benefit from having access to the opinions of a population of users, and use this data to make inferences about their traits. Applications in [[information technology]] seek to [[Data mining|mine end user data]] to support and improve machine-based processes, such as [[information retrieval]] and [[Recommender system|recommendation]]. However, processing the high volumes of data offered by UGC necessitate the ability to automatically sort and filter these data points according to their value.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Momeni | first1 = E. | last2 = Cardie | first2 = C. | author2-link = Claire Cardie | last3 = Diakopoulos | first3 = N. | year = 2016 | title = A Survey on Assessment and Ranking Methodologies for User-Generated Content on the Web | url = | journal = ACM Computing Surveys  | volume = 48 | issue = 3| page = 41 }}</ref>\n\nDetermining the value of user contributions for assessment and ranking can be difficult due to the variation in the quality and structure of this data. The quality and structure of the data provided by UGC is application-dependent, and can include items such as tags, reviews, or comments that may or may not be accompanied by useful [[metadata]]. Additionally, the value of this data depends on the specific task for which it will be utilized and the available features of the application domain. Value can ultimately be defined and assessed according to whether the application will provide service to a crowd of humans, a single end user, or a platform designer.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\"/>\n\nThe variation of data and specificity of value has resulted in various approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC. The performance of each method essentially depends on the [[Feature selection|features and metrics]] that are available for analysis. Consequently, it is critical to have an understanding of the task objective and its relation to how the data is collected, structured, and represented in order to choose the most appropriate approach to utilizing it. The methods of assessment and ranking can be categorized into two classes: human-centered and machine-centered. Methods emphasizing human-centered utility consider the ranking and assessment problem in terms of the users and their interactions with the system, whereas the machine-centered method considers the problem in terms of [[machine learning]] and [[Computational science|computation]]. The various methods of assessment and ranking can be classified into one of four approaches: community-based, user-based, designer-based, and hybrid.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\"/>\n* '''Community-based approaches''' rely on establishing ground truth based on the [[wisdom of the crowd]] regarding the content of interest. The assessments provided by the community of end users is utilized to directly rank content within the system in human-centered methods. The machine-centered method applies these community judgments in training algorithms to automatically assess and rank UGC.\n* '''User-based approaches''' emphasize the differences between individual users so that ranking and assessment can interactively adapt or be personalized given the particular requirements of each user.  The human-centered approach accentuates interactive [[User interface|interfaces]] where the user can define and redefine their preferences as their interests shift. On the other hand, machine-centered approaches model the individual user according to explicit and implicit knowledge that is gathered through system interactions.\n* '''Designer-based approaches''' primarily use machine-centered methods to essentially maximize the diversity of content presented to users in order to avoid constraining the space of topic selections or perspectives. The diversity of content can be assessed with respect to various dimensions, such as authorship, topics, sentiments, and named entities.\n* '''Hybrid approaches''' seek to combine methods from the various frameworks in order to develop a more robust approach for assessing and ranking UGC. Approaches are most often combined in one of two ways: the crowd-based approach is often used to identify [[hyperlocal]] content for a user-based approach, or a user-based approach is used to maintain the intent of a designer-based approach.\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#User-generated_content|label 1=User-generated content}}\n\nThere are many types of user-generated content: [[Internet forum]]s, where people talk about different topics; [[blog]]s are services where users can post about many topics, [[product reviews]] on a supplier website or in social media; [[wiki]]s such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wikia]] allow users, sometimes including anonymous users, to edit the content. Another type of user-generated content are [[social networking site]]s like [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], or [[VK (social network)|VK]], where users interact with other people via chatting, writing messages, posting images or links, and sharing content.  Media hosting sites such as [[YouTube]] allow users to post content. Some forms of user-generated content, such as a social commentary blog, can be considered as a form of [[citizen journalism]].\n\n=== Blogs ===\n{{See also|Blog#Types|label 1=Blog types}}\n\nBlogs are websites created by individuals, groups, and associations.

[[TripAdvisor]] includes reviews and recommendations by travelers about hotels, restaurants, and activities.\n\nThe restaurant industry has also been altered by a review system the places more emphasis on online reviews and content from peers than traditional media reviews. In 2011 [[Yelp]] contained 70% of reviews for restaurants in the Seattle area compared to ''[[Food & Wine]]'' Magazine containing less than 5 percent.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932322941|title=Handbook of media economics.

A few [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s including ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[EverQuest 2]]'' have UGC systems integrated into the game itself.<ref name=\"MMORPG.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/8818 |title=The 5 Best User Generated Content Systems in MMOs |last1=Jagneaux |first1=David |date=18 Aug 2014 |website=MMORPG.com |publisher=Cyber Creations Inc. |accessdate=19 Aug 2014}}</ref> A [[metaverse]] can be a user-generated world, such as ''[[Second Life]]''.\n\n===Advertising===\nA popular use of UGC involves collaboration between a brand and a user. For example, the \"Elf Yourself\" videos by Jib Jab that come back every year around Christmas. The Jib Jab website lets people use their photos of friends and family that they have uploaded to make a holiday video to share across the internet.

For example, Toyota leveraged UGC for their \"Feeling the Streets\" Facebook ad campaign and were able to increase their total ad engagement by 440%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stackla.com/case-studies/toyota-boosts-facebook-ads-440-percent/|title=Toyota boosts Facebook Ads engagement by 440% {{!}} Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|work=Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===Retailers===\nSome bargain hunting websites feature user-generated content, such as [[eBay]], [[Dealsplus]], and [[FatWallet]] which allow users to post, discuss, and control which bargains get promoted within the community. Because of the dependency of social interaction, these sites fall into the category of [[social commerce]].\n\n===Educational===\n[[Wikipedia]], a free encyclopedia, is one of the largest user-generated content databases in the world. Platforms such as [[YouTube]] have frequently been used as an instructional aide. Organizations such as the [[Khan Academy]] and the [[Green brothers]] have used the platform to upload series of videos on topics such as math, science, and history to help aid viewers master or better understand the basics. Educational [[podcast]]s have also helped in teaching through an audio platform. Personal websites and messaging systems like Yahoo Messenger have also been used to transmit user-generated educational content. There have also been web forums where users give advice to each other.\n\nStudents can also manipulate digital images or video clips to their advantage and tag them with easy to find keywords then share them to friends and family worldwide. The category of \"student performance content\" has risen in the form of  discussion boards and chat logs. Students could write reflective journals and diaries that may help others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://itdl.org/Journal/Oct_07/article02.htm|title=Teaching and Learning in the Web 2.0 Era: Empowering Students through Learner-Generated Content |last1=Lee |first1=Mark J.

[[Flickr]] is a site in which users are able to upload personal photos they have taken and label them in regards to their \"motivation\".<ref name=\"Shirky2008\">{{Cite book|title = Here Comes Everybody|last = Shirky|first = Clay|publisher = The Penguin Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>{{rp|46}} Flickr not only hosts images but makes them publicly available for reuse and reuse with modification.<ref name=\"Shirky2008\"/> [[Instagram]] is a social media platform that allows users to edit, upload and include location information with photos they post.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manikonda, Lydia Hu, Yuheng Kambhampati, Subbarao|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1106208719|title=Analyzing User Activities, Demographics, Social Network Structure and User-Generated Content on Instagram|date=2014-10-29|oclc=1106208719}}</ref>\n\n=== Short Video sharing ===\nShort video is a fast emerging type of UGC. [[TikTok]], a short video social media app, allows users to create short video from 3 to 15 seconds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidingtech.com/top-tiktok-musically-app-tips-tricks/|title=Top 10 TikTok (Musical.ly) App Tips and Tricks|website=Guiding Tech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>. Unlike longer video sharing platform like [[YouTube|Youtube]], where user has 100% freedom to create whatever content they want, Tiktok provides a lot of shortcuts to simplify the creative process. TikTok users can borrow background music from other users, create content using a meta theme, do reaction videos through the \"react\" feature, and add special effects through video filters.\n\n==Effect on journalism==\nThe incorporation of user-generated content into mainstream [[journalism]] outlets is considered to have begun in 2005 with the [[BBC|BBC's]] creation of a user-generated content team, which was expanded and made permanent in the wake of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7, 2005 London bombings]].<ref name=\"BBC\" /> The incorporation of Web 2.0 technologies into news websites allowed user-generated content online to move from more social platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[LiveJournal]], and [[blog|personal blogs]], into the mainstream of online journalism, in the form of comments on news articles written by professional journalists, but also through surveys, content sharing, and other forms of citizen journalism.<ref name=\"Thurman\">{{cite journal|last1=Thurman|first1=Neil|title=Forums for citizen journalists?

A 2016 study on publisher business models suggests that readers of online news sources value articles written both by professional journalists, as well as users\u2014provided that those users are experts in a field relevant to the content that they create. In response to this, it is suggested that online news sites must consider themselves not only a source for articles and other types of journalism, but also a platform for engagement and feedback from their communities. The ongoing engagement with a news site that is possible due to the interactive nature of user-generated content is considered a source of sustainable revenue for publishers of online journalism going forward.<ref name=\"Zeng et al\">{{cite journal|last1=Zeng|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dennstedt|first2=Bianca|last3=Koller|first3=Hans|title=Democratizing Journalism \u2013 How User-Generated Content and User Communities Affect Publishers' Business Models|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|date=6 November 2016|volume=25|issue=5|pages=536\u2013551|doi=10.1111/caim.12199}}</ref>\n\n==Use in marketing==\nThe use of user-generated content has been prominent in the efforts of marketing online, especially among millennials.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://blog.startafire.com/user-generated-content-marketing/ | title = A Complete Guide to User Generated Content Marketing | author = Jack Collins | date = 11 July 2016 | accessdate = 2017-04-02}}</ref> A good reason for this may be that 86% of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they support, and 60% believe user-generated content is not only the most authentic form of content, but also the most influential when making purchasing decisions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stackla.com/go/2017-consumer-content-report-influence-in-digital-age/|title=2017 Consumer Content Report: Influence in the Digital Age|date=2017-11-10|work=Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAn increasing number of companies have been employing UGC techniques into their marketing efforts, such as [[Starbucks]] with their \"White Cup Contest\" campaign where customers competed to create the best doodle on their cups.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/future-ugc-owned/307322/ | title = The Future of User-Generated Contant is Owned | author = David Hunegnaw | date = 6 January 2017 | accessdate = 2016-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of UGC in marketing has been shown to be significant as well. For instance, the \"[[Share a Coke]]\" by [[Coca-Cola]] campaign in which customers uploaded images of themselves with bottles to social media attributed to a two percent increase in revenue. Of millennials, UGC can influence purchase decisions up to fifty-nine percent of the time, and eighty-four percent say that UGC on company websites has at least some influence on what they buy, typically in a positive way. As a whole, consumers place peer recommendations and reviews above those of professionals.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dmnews.com/content-marketing/10-stats-that-show-why-user-generated-content-works/article/444872/ | title = 10 Stats That Show Why User-Generated Content Works | author = John Battelle | date = 16 October 2016 | accessdate = 2017-04-02}}</ref>\n\nUser-generated content used in a marketing context has been known to help brands in numerous ways.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://sproutsocial.com/insights/user-generated-content-guide/ | title = The Ultimate User-Generated Content Guide | author = Alex York | date = 5 October 2016 | accessdate = 2017-04-02}}</ref> \n* '''It encourages more engagement''' with its users, and doubles the likeliness that the content will be shared. \n* '''It builds trust''' with consumers.

A better response{{According to whom|date=October 2010}} might be to offer optional expressions that better capture the spirit and nature of such work, such as EGC, Entrepreneurial Generated Content (see external reference below).{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nSometimes creative works made by individuals are lost because there are limited or no ways to precisely preserve creations when a UGC Web site service closes down. One example of such loss is the closing of the Disney [[massively multiplayer online game]] \"[[VMK]]\". VMK, like most games, has items that are traded from user to user. Many of these items are rare within the game. Users are able to use these items to create their own rooms, avatars and pin lanyard. This site shut down at 10&nbsp;pm CDT on 21 May 2008. There are ways to preserve the essence, if not the entirety of such work through the users copying text and media to applications on their personal computers or recording live action or animated scenes using screen capture software, and then uploading elsewhere. Long before the Web, creative works were simply lost or went out of publication and disappeared from history unless individuals found ways to keep them in personal collections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAnother criticized aspect is the vast array of user-generated product and service reviews that can at times be misleading for consumer on the web. \nA study conducted at Cornell University found that an estimated 1 to 6 percent of positive user-generated online hotel reviews are fake.<ref>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Martha C.|title=Be Wary of Awesome and Scathing Online Reviews|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/be-wary-awesome-scathing-online-reviews-n72116|accessdate=25 November 2014|agency=NBC NEWS|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother concern of platforms that rely heavily on user-generated content, such as Twitter and Facebook, is how easy it is to find people who holds the same opinions and interests in addition to how well they facilitate the creation of networks or closed groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Siying|last2=Gregory|first2=Steve|date=2016-11-30|title=The Echo Chamber Effect in Twitter: does community polarization increase?|journal=Complex Networks & Their Applications V|volume=693|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=373\u2013378|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-50901-3_30|isbn=9783319509006}}</ref> While the strength of these services are that users can broaden their horizon by sharing their knowledge and connect with other people from around the world, these platforms also make it very easy to connect with only a restricted sample of people who holds similar opinions (see [[Filter bubble]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowell|first=Tracy|date=2017-05-12|title=Response to the editorial 'Education in a post-truth world'|journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory|volume=49|issue=6|pages=582\u2013585|doi=10.1080/00131857.2017.1288805|issn=0013-1857|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism regarding whether or not those who contribute to a platform should be paid for their content. In 2015, A group of 18 famous content creators on Vine attempted to negotiate a deal with Vine representatives to secure a $1.2 million contract for a guaranteed 12 videos a month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/10/paying-viners-millions-wouldnt-have-saved-vine.html|title=Could Paying Millions of Dollars to Creators Have Saved Vine?|last=Kircher|first=Madison Malone|website=Intelligencer|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This negotiation was not successful. \n\n==Legal problems==\nThe ability for services to accept user-generated content opens up a number of legal concerns, from the more broader sense to specific local laws. In general, knowing who committed the online crime is difficult because many use pseudonyms or remain anonymous. Sometimes it can be traced back. But in the case of a public coffee shop, they have no way of pinpointing the exact user. There is also a problem with the issues surrounding extremely harmful but not legal acts. For example, the posting of content that instigates a person's suicide.

In the United States, the \"[[Section 230]]\" exemptions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] state that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" This clause effectively provides a general immunity for websites that host user-generated content that is defamatory, deceptive or otherwise harmful, even if the operator knows that the third-party content is harmful and refuses to take it down.

The length of the video had decreased by two-fold from the non-UGC content but they saw a fast production rate. The user behavior is what perpetuates the UGC. The act of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) was studied and saw a great benefit to the system. They also studied the impact of content aliasing, sharing of multiple copies, and illegal uploads.<ref>[[Cha Meeyoung]] et al. \"I tube, you tube, everybody tubes: analyzing the world's largest user generated content video system.\" ''Internet Measurement Conference'' (2007).</ref>\n\nA study from [[York University]] in [[Ontario]] in 2012 conducted a research that resulted in a proposed framework for comparing brand-related UGC and to understand how the strategy used by a company could influence the brand sentiment across different social media channels including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. The three scholars of this study examined two clothing brands, Lulu Lemon and American Apparel. The difference between these two brands is that Lulu Lemon had a social media following while American Apparel was the complete opposite with no social media following. Unsurprisingly, Lulu Lemon had much more positive contributions compared to American Apparel which had less positive contributions.

Conversational or two-way media is a key characteristic of so-called [[Web 2.0]] which encourages the publishing of one's own content and commenting on other people's content.\n\nThe role of the passive audience therefore has shifted since the birth of [[New media|New Media]], and an ever-growing number of participatory users are taking advantage of the interactive opportunities, especially on the Internet to create independent content. Grassroots experimentation then generated an innovation in sounds, artists, techniques and associations with audiences which then are being used in mainstream media.<ref>Jenkins, Henry (SODA), \"Convergence Culture\", New York University Press, New York</ref> The active, participatory and creative audience is prevailing today with relatively accessible media, tools and applications, and its culture is in turn affecting mass media corporations and global audiences.\n\nThe [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has defined three central schools for UGC:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/14/38393115.pdf|title=Working Party on the Information Economy - PARTICIPATIVE WEB: USER-CREATED CONTENT}}</ref>\n\n# '''Publication requirement:''' While UGC could be made by a user and never published online or elsewhere, we focus here on the work that is published in some context, be it on a publicly accessible website or on a page on a social networking site only accessible to a select group of people (e.g., fellow university students). This is a useful way to exclude email, two-way instant messages and the like.\n# '''Creative effort:''' Creative effort was put into creating the work or adapting existing works to construct a new one; i.e. users must add their own value to the work. UGC often also has a collaborative element to it, as is the case with websites which users can edit collaboratively. For example, merely copying a portion of a television show and posting it to an online video website (an activity frequently seen on the UGC sites) would not be considered UGC. If a user uploads his/her photographs, however, expresses his/her thoughts in a blog, or creates a new music video, this could be considered UGC. Yet the minimum amount of creative effort is hard to define and depends on the context.\n# '''Creation outside of professional routines and practices:''' User-generated content is generally created outside of professional routines and practices. It often does not have an institutional or a commercial market context. In extreme cases, UGC may be produced by non-professionals without the expectation of profit or remuneration. Motivating factors include: connecting with peers, achieving a certain level of fame, notoriety, or prestige, and the desire to express oneself.\n\nIt is important to have an objective before attempting to become part of the UGC/social networking environment. For example, companies may ask users to post their reviews directly to their Facebook page. This could end up disastrous if a user makes a comment that steers people away from the product.<ref>{{cite web|last1=IAB|title=IAB Status Platform Report|url=http://www.iab.net/media/file/2008_ugc_platform.pdf|website=IAB.NET}}</ref>\n\nMere [[copy & paste]] or [[hyperlink]]ing could also be seen as user-generated self-expression. The action of linking to a work or copying a work could in itself motivate the creator, express the taste of the person linking or copying. [[Digg|Digg.com]], [[StumbleUpon|StumbleUpon.com]], and leaptag.com are good examples of where such linkage to work happens. The culmination of such linkages could very well identify the tastes of a person in the community and make that person unique.\n\nBriefly User-Generated Content occurs when a product's customers create and disseminate online ideas about a product or the firm that markets it. These ideas are often in the form of text but also come in other forms such as music, photos, or videos. UGC has three key characteristics: (1) The contribution is by users of a product rather than the firm that sells this product; (2) it is creative in nature and the user adds something new; (3) it is posted online and generally accessible.\n\n== Defining Characteristics of User-Generated Content (UGC) ==\n1.) The contribution is by the users of a product rather than the firm that sells the product.\n\n2.) These contributions are somewhat creative in nature and the user adds something new to what has been done before.\n\n3.) These ideas and contributions are posted online and are generally accessible to everyone.\n\n4.) User Generated Content helps the brand to create a strong base of engaging users with them which also helps them get newer ideas for product development and expansion.\n\n== Media pluralism ==\n{{Main|Media pluralism}}\nAccording to [[Cisco Systems]], in 2016 an average of 96,000 [[petabyte]]s was transferred monthly over the Internet, more than twice as many as in 2012.<ref>Cisco Systems. 201.

In January 2017, [[Wikipedia]] had more than 43 million articles, almost twice as many as in January 2012.

And the point is, the way they do it, the way they will be asked and instructed to do it, is to read voraciously and whenever they see a word, whether it's a preposition or a sesquipedalian monster, they are to... if it interests them and if where they read it, they see it in a sentence that illustrates the way that that word is used, offers the meaning of the day to that word, then they are to write it on a slip of paper... the top left-hand side you write the word, the chosen word, the catch word, which in this case is 'twilight'. Then the quotation, the quotation illustrates the meaning of the word. And underneath it, the citation, were it came from, whether it was printed or whether it was in manuscript... and then the reference, the volume, the page and so on... and send these slips of paper, these slips are the key to the making of this dictionary, in to the headquarters of the dictionary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvo.org//transcript/883597/video/archive/big-ideas/simon-winchester-on-his-book-the-meaning-of-everything|title=Transcript: Simon Winchester on his book The Meaning of Everything - Jul 23, 2005 - TVO.org|website=www.tvo.org}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn the following decades, hundreds of thousands of contributions were sent to the editors.\n\nIn the 1990s several electronic [[bulletin board systems]] were based on user-generated content. Some of these systems have been converted into websites, including the film information site [[IMDb]] which started as ''rec.arts.movies'' in 1990. With the growth of the [[World Wide Web]] the focus moved to websites, several of which were based on user-generated content, including [[Wikipedia]] (2001) and [[Flickr]] (2004).\n\nUser-generated [[Internet video]] was popularized by [[YouTube]], an [[online video platform]] founded by [[Chad Hurley]], [[Jawed Karim]] and [[Steve Chen]] in April 2005. It enabled the [[video streaming]] of [[MPEG-4 AVC]] (H.264) user-generated content from anywhere on the [[World Wide Web]].<ref name=\"Matthew\">{{cite book |last1=Matthew |first1=Crick |title=Power, Surveillance, and Culture in YouTube\u2122's Digital Sphere |date=2016 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=9781466698567 |pages=36\u20137 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-FmCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36}}</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC]] set up a pilot user-generated content team in April 2005 with 3 staff. In the wake of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] and the [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield oil depot fire]], the team was made permanent and was expanded, reflecting the arrival in the mainstream of the [[citizen journalist]]. After the Buncefield disaster the BBC received over 5,000 photos from viewers. The BBC does not normally pay for content generated by its viewers.\n\nIn 2006 [[CNN]] launched [[CNN iReport]], a project designed to bring user-generated news content to CNN. Its rival [[Fox News Channel]] launched its project to bring in user-generated news, similarly titled \"uReport\". This was typical of major television news organisations in 2005\u20132006, who realised, particularly in the wake of the London 7 July bombings, that [[citizen journalism]] could now become a significant part of broadcast news.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> [[Sky News]], for example, regularly solicits for photographs and video from its viewers.\n\nUser-generated content was featured in ''Time'' magazine's 2006 [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Person of the Year]], in which the person of the year was \"you\", meaning all of the people who contribute to user-generated media, including YouTube, Wikipedia and [[MySpace]].<ref name=\"TIME\"/> A precursor to user-generated content uploaded on YouTube was ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|title=Converging Media|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=9780199342303|page=140|edition=4}}</ref>\n\n==Motivation for creating UGC==\nWhile the benefit derived from user-generated content for the content host is clear, the benefit to the contributor is less direct. There are various theories behind the motivation for contributing user-generated content, ranging from altruistic, to social, to materialistic. Due to the high value of user-generated content, many sites use incentives to encourage their generation. These incentives can be generally categorized into implicit incentives and explicit incentives.<ref name=\"TouunaGroup\">Toluna:{{cite web|url=http://www.toluna-group.com/files/en/Whitepapers/Web%20Incentives%20Whitepaper.pdf|title=Mixing Financial, Social and Fun Incentives for Social Voting|accessdate=3 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709193004/http://www.toluna-group.com/files/en/Whitepapers/Web%20Incentives%20Whitepaper.pdf|archive-date=9 July 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n# '''Implicit incentives:''' These incentives are not based on anything tangible. Social incentives are the most common form of implicit incentives. These incentives allow the user to feel good as an active member of the community. These can include relationship between users, such as  [[Facebook]]'s friends, or [[Twitter]]'s followers. Social incentives also include the ability to connect users with others, as seen on the sites already mentioned as well as sites like YouTube, which allow users to share media from their lives with others. Users also share the experiences that they have while using a particular product/service. This will improve the customer experience as they can make informed decisions in buying a product, which makes them smart buyers. Other common social incentives are status, badges or levels within the site, something a user earns when they reach a certain level of participation which may or may not come with additional privileges. [[Yahoo! Answers]] is an example of this type of social incentive. Another social incentive is social comparison. Being aware of the user's own ranking or level among the whole community could affect the behavior as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yan|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph|last4=Li|first4=Sherry Xin|date=September 2010|title=Social Comparisons and Contributions to Online Communities: A Field Experiment on MovieLens|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.4.1358|journal=American Economic Review|volume=100|issue=4|pages=1358\u20131398|doi=10.1257/aer.100.4.1358|issn=0002-8282}}</ref> Social incentives cost the host site very little and can catalyze vital growth; however, their very nature requires a sizable existing community before it can function. Social incentive can also be split into identification and integration. The identification motivation has strong external standardization and internalization of behavioral goals, such as social identity, that is, users will follow some subjective norms and images to constrain and practice their behaviors. The integration has the strongest external standardization and goal internalization, and the agent often integrates its actual actions with the subjective norms of the environment, so it has the effect of self-restraint and self-realization, such as the sense of belonging. [[Naver|Naver Knowledge-iN]] is another example of this type of social incentive. It uses a point system to encourage users to answer more questions by receiving points.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nam|first=Kevin Kyung|last2=Ackerman|first2=Mark S.|last3=Adamic|first3=Lada A.|date=2009|title=Questions in, knowledge in?: a study of naver's question answering community|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1518701.1518821|journal=Proceedings of the 27th international conference on Human factors in computing systems - CHI 09|language=en|location=Boston, MA, USA|publisher=ACM Press|pages=779|doi=10.1145/1518701.1518821|isbn=978-1-60558-246-7}}</ref>\n# '''Explicit incentives:''' These incentives refer to tangible rewards. Explicit incentives can be split into externality and projection. External motivation is more inclined to economic and material incentives, such as the reward for engaging in a task, which has little internalization and lacks relevant external norms and constraints. Examples include financial payment, entry into a contest, a voucher, a coupon, or frequent traveler miles. Direct explicit incentives are easily understandable by most and have immediate value regardless of the community size; sites such as the Canadian shopping platform [[Wishabi]] and [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] both use this type of financial incentive in slightly different ways to encourage user participation. The projective agent has some external norms, but the degree of internalization is not enough, that is, it has not been fully recognized by the actor. The drawback to explicit incentives is that they may cause the user to be subject to the over justification effect, eventually believing the only reason for the participating is for the explicit incentive. This reduces the influence of the other form of social or altruistic motivation, making it increasingly costly for the content host to retain long-term contributors.<ref name=\"HOPLA Online\">HOPLA Online:{{cite web |url=https://hopla.online/blog/user-generated-content-moderation-brand-trust/|title=User-generated Content Moderation: Shaping Brand Trust and Recognition|accessdate=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n\n==Ranking and assessment==\nThe distribution of UGC across the [[World Wide Web|Web]] provides a high volume data source that is accessible for [[Data analysis|analysis]], and offers utility in enhancing the experiences of [[end user]]s. [[Social science]] research can benefit from having access to the opinions of a population of users, and use this data to make inferences about their traits. Applications in [[information technology]] seek to [[Data mining|mine end user data]] to support and improve machine-based processes, such as [[information retrieval]] and [[Recommender system|recommendation]]. However, processing the high volumes of data offered by UGC necessitate the ability to automatically sort and filter these data points according to their value.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\">{{cite journal | last1 = Momeni | first1 = E. | last2 = Cardie | first2 = C. | author2-link = Claire Cardie | last3 = Diakopoulos | first3 = N. | year = 2016 | title = A Survey on Assessment and Ranking Methodologies for User-Generated Content on the Web | url = | journal = ACM Computing Surveys  | volume = 48 | issue = 3| page = 41 }}</ref>\n\nDetermining the value of user contributions for assessment and ranking can be difficult due to the variation in the quality and structure of this data. The quality and structure of the data provided by UGC is application-dependent, and can include items such as tags, reviews, or comments that may or may not be accompanied by useful [[metadata]]. Additionally, the value of this data depends on the specific task for which it will be utilized and the available features of the application domain. Value can ultimately be defined and assessed according to whether the application will provide service to a crowd of humans, a single end user, or a platform designer.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\"/>\n\nThe variation of data and specificity of value has resulted in various approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC. The performance of each method essentially depends on the [[Feature selection|features and metrics]] that are available for analysis. Consequently, it is critical to have an understanding of the task objective and its relation to how the data is collected, structured, and represented in order to choose the most appropriate approach to utilizing it. The methods of assessment and ranking can be categorized into two classes: human-centered and machine-centered. Methods emphasizing human-centered utility consider the ranking and assessment problem in terms of the users and their interactions with the system, whereas the machine-centered method considers the problem in terms of [[machine learning]] and [[Computational science|computation]]. The various methods of assessment and ranking can be classified into one of four approaches: community-based, user-based, designer-based, and hybrid.<ref name=\"Momeni et al (2016)\"/>\n* '''Community-based approaches''' rely on establishing ground truth based on the [[wisdom of the crowd]] regarding the content of interest. The assessments provided by the community of end users is utilized to directly rank content within the system in human-centered methods. The machine-centered method applies these community judgments in training algorithms to automatically assess and rank UGC.\n* '''User-based approaches''' emphasize the differences between individual users so that ranking and assessment can interactively adapt or be personalized given the particular requirements of each user.  The human-centered approach accentuates interactive [[User interface|interfaces]] where the user can define and redefine their preferences as their interests shift. On the other hand, machine-centered approaches model the individual user according to explicit and implicit knowledge that is gathered through system interactions.\n* '''Designer-based approaches''' primarily use machine-centered methods to essentially maximize the diversity of content presented to users in order to avoid constraining the space of topic selections or perspectives. The diversity of content can be assessed with respect to various dimensions, such as authorship, topics, sentiments, and named entities.\n* '''Hybrid approaches''' seek to combine methods from the various frameworks in order to develop a more robust approach for assessing and ranking UGC. Approaches are most often combined in one of two ways: the crowd-based approach is often used to identify [[hyperlocal]] content for a user-based approach, or a user-based approach is used to maintain the intent of a designer-based approach.\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Reliable_sources#User-generated_content|label 1=User-generated content}}\n\nThere are many types of user-generated content: [[Internet forum]]s, where people talk about different topics; [[blog]]s are services where users can post about many topics, [[product reviews]] on a supplier website or in social media; [[wiki]]s such as [[Wikipedia]] and [[Wikia]] allow users, sometimes including anonymous users, to edit the content. Another type of user-generated content are [[social networking site]]s like [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], or [[VK (social network)|VK]], where users interact with other people via chatting, writing messages, posting images or links, and sharing content.  Media hosting sites such as [[YouTube]] allow users to post content. Some forms of user-generated content, such as a social commentary blog, can be considered as a form of [[citizen journalism]].\n\n=== Blogs ===\n{{See also|Blog#Types|label 1=Blog types}}\n\nBlogs are websites created by individuals, groups, and associations. They mostly consist of journal-style text and enable interaction between a blogger and reader in the form of online comments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godwin-Jones|first=Robert|date=May 2003|title=Blogs and Wikis: Environments for online collaboration|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/25195/07_02_emerging.pdf|journal=Language Learning & Technology|volume=7|number=2|pages=12\u201316}}</ref> Self-hosted blogs can be created by professional entities such as entrepreneurs and small businesses.

[[Social networking service|Social networking]] blogging platforms include: Tumblr, [[LiveJournal]], and [[Sina Weibo]]. Among the many blogs on the web, [[Boing Boing]] is a group blog with themes including [[technology]] and [[science fiction]]; [[HuffPost]] blogs include opinions on subjects such as politics, entertainment, technology.

[[TripAdvisor]] includes reviews and recommendations by travelers about hotels, restaurants, and activities.\n\nThe restaurant industry has also been altered by a review system the places more emphasis on online reviews and content from peers than traditional media reviews. In 2011 [[Yelp]] contained 70% of reviews for restaurants in the Seattle area compared to ''[[Food & Wine]]'' Magazine containing less than 5 percent.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932322941|title=Handbook of media economics.

A few [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s including ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' and ''[[EverQuest 2]]'' have UGC systems integrated into the game itself.<ref name=\"MMORPG.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/loadFeature/8818 |title=The 5 Best User Generated Content Systems in MMOs |last1=Jagneaux |first1=David |date=18 Aug 2014 |website=MMORPG.com |publisher=Cyber Creations Inc. |accessdate=19 Aug 2014}}</ref> A [[metaverse]] can be a user-generated world, such as ''[[Second Life]]''.\n\n===Advertising===\nA popular use of UGC involves collaboration between a brand and a user. For example, the \"Elf Yourself\" videos by Jib Jab that come back every year around Christmas. The Jib Jab website lets people use their photos of friends and family that they have uploaded to make a holiday video to share across the internet.

For example, Toyota leveraged UGC for their \"Feeling the Streets\" Facebook ad campaign and were able to increase their total ad engagement by 440%.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stackla.com/case-studies/toyota-boosts-facebook-ads-440-percent/|title=Toyota boosts Facebook Ads engagement by 440% {{!}} Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|work=Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===Retailers===\nSome bargain hunting websites feature user-generated content, such as [[eBay]], [[Dealsplus]], and [[FatWallet]] which allow users to post, discuss, and control which bargains get promoted within the community. Because of the dependency of social interaction, these sites fall into the category of [[social commerce]].\n\n===Educational===\n[[Wikipedia]], a free encyclopedia, is one of the largest user-generated content databases in the world. Platforms such as [[YouTube]] have frequently been used as an instructional aide. Organizations such as the [[Khan Academy]] and the [[Green brothers]] have used the platform to upload series of videos on topics such as math, science, and history to help aid viewers master or better understand the basics. Educational [[podcast]]s have also helped in teaching through an audio platform. Personal websites and messaging systems like Yahoo Messenger have also been used to transmit user-generated educational content. There have also been web forums where users give advice to each other.\n\nStudents can also manipulate digital images or video clips to their advantage and tag them with easy to find keywords then share them to friends and family worldwide. The category of \"student performance content\" has risen in the form of  discussion boards and chat logs. Students could write reflective journals and diaries that may help others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://itdl.org/Journal/Oct_07/article02.htm|title=Teaching and Learning in the Web 2.0 Era: Empowering Students through Learner-Generated Content |last1=Lee |first1=Mark J.

[[Flickr]] is a site in which users are able to upload personal photos they have taken and label them in regards to their \"motivation\".<ref name=\"Shirky2008\">{{Cite book|title = Here Comes Everybody|last = Shirky|first = Clay|publisher = The Penguin Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>{{rp|46}} Flickr not only hosts images but makes them publicly available for reuse and reuse with modification.<ref name=\"Shirky2008\"/> [[Instagram]] is a social media platform that allows users to edit, upload and include location information with photos they post.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manikonda, Lydia Hu, Yuheng Kambhampati, Subbarao|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1106208719|title=Analyzing User Activities, Demographics, Social Network Structure and User-Generated Content on Instagram|date=2014-10-29|oclc=1106208719}}</ref>\n\n=== Short Video sharing ===\nShort video is a fast emerging type of UGC. [[TikTok]], a short video social media app, allows users to create short video from 3 to 15 seconds<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidingtech.com/top-tiktok-musically-app-tips-tricks/|title=Top 10 TikTok (Musical.ly) App Tips and Tricks|website=Guiding Tech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>. Unlike longer video sharing platform like [[YouTube|Youtube]], where user has 100% freedom to create whatever content they want, Tiktok provides a lot of shortcuts to simplify the creative process. TikTok users can borrow background music from other users, create content using a meta theme, do reaction videos through the \"react\" feature, and add special effects through video filters.\n\n==Effect on journalism==\nThe incorporation of user-generated content into mainstream [[journalism]] outlets is considered to have begun in 2005 with the [[BBC|BBC's]] creation of a user-generated content team, which was expanded and made permanent in the wake of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7, 2005 London bombings]].<ref name=\"BBC\" /> The incorporation of Web 2.0 technologies into news websites allowed user-generated content online to move from more social platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[LiveJournal]], and [[blog|personal blogs]], into the mainstream of online journalism, in the form of comments on news articles written by professional journalists, but also through surveys, content sharing, and other forms of citizen journalism.<ref name=\"Thurman\">{{cite journal|last1=Thurman|first1=Neil|title=Forums for citizen journalists?

A 2016 study on publisher business models suggests that readers of online news sources value articles written both by professional journalists, as well as users\u2014provided that those users are experts in a field relevant to the content that they create. In response to this, it is suggested that online news sites must consider themselves not only a source for articles and other types of journalism, but also a platform for engagement and feedback from their communities. The ongoing engagement with a news site that is possible due to the interactive nature of user-generated content is considered a source of sustainable revenue for publishers of online journalism going forward.<ref name=\"Zeng et al\">{{cite journal|last1=Zeng|first1=Michael A.|last2=Dennstedt|first2=Bianca|last3=Koller|first3=Hans|title=Democratizing Journalism \u2013 How User-Generated Content and User Communities Affect Publishers' Business Models|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|date=6 November 2016|volume=25|issue=5|pages=536\u2013551|doi=10.1111/caim.12199}}</ref>\n\n==Use in marketing==\nThe use of user-generated content has been prominent in the efforts of marketing online, especially among millennials.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://blog.startafire.com/user-generated-content-marketing/ | title = A Complete Guide to User Generated Content Marketing | author = Jack Collins | date = 11 July 2016 | accessdate = 2017-04-02}}</ref> A good reason for this may be that 86% of consumers say authenticity is important when deciding which brands they support, and 60% believe user-generated content is not only the most authentic form of content, but also the most influential when making purchasing decisions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://stackla.com/go/2017-consumer-content-report-influence-in-digital-age/|title=2017 Consumer Content Report: Influence in the Digital Age|date=2017-11-10|work=Stackla - User-Generated Content Marketing|access-date=2018-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAn increasing number of companies have been employing UGC techniques into their marketing efforts, such as [[Starbucks]] with their \"White Cup Contest\" campaign where customers competed to create the best doodle on their cups.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/future-ugc-owned/307322/ | title = The Future of User-Generated Contant is Owned | author = David Hunegnaw | date = 6 January 2017 | accessdate = 2016-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of UGC in marketing has been shown to be significant as well. For instance, the \"[[Share a Coke]]\" by [[Coca-Cola]] campaign in which customers uploaded images of themselves with bottles to social media attributed to a two percent increase in revenue. Of millennials, UGC can influence purchase decisions up to fifty-nine percent of the time, and eighty-four percent say that UGC on company websites has at least some influence on what they buy, typically in a positive way.

One example of such loss is the closing of the Disney [[massively multiplayer online game]] \"[[VMK]]\". VMK, like most games, has items that are traded from user to user. Many of these items are rare within the game. Users are able to use these items to create their own rooms, avatars and pin lanyard. This site shut down at 10&nbsp;pm CDT on 21 May 2008. There are ways to preserve the essence, if not the entirety of such work through the users copying text and media to applications on their personal computers or recording live action or animated scenes using screen capture software, and then uploading elsewhere. Long before the Web, creative works were simply lost or went out of publication and disappeared from history unless individuals found ways to keep them in personal collections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nAnother criticized aspect is the vast array of user-generated product and service reviews that can at times be misleading for consumer on the web. \nA study conducted at Cornell University found that an estimated 1 to 6 percent of positive user-generated online hotel reviews are fake.<ref>{{cite news|last1=White|first1=Martha C.|title=Be Wary of Awesome and Scathing Online Reviews|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/be-wary-awesome-scathing-online-reviews-n72116|accessdate=25 November 2014|agency=NBC NEWS|date=7 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother concern of platforms that rely heavily on user-generated content, such as Twitter and Facebook, is how easy it is to find people who holds the same opinions and interests in addition to how well they facilitate the creation of networks or closed groups.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Siying|last2=Gregory|first2=Steve|date=2016-11-30|title=The Echo Chamber Effect in Twitter: does community polarization increase?|journal=Complex Networks & Their Applications V|volume=693|series=Studies in Computational Intelligence|publisher=Springer, Cham|pages=373\u2013378|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-50901-3_30|isbn=9783319509006}}</ref> While the strength of these services are that users can broaden their horizon by sharing their knowledge and connect with other people from around the world, these platforms also make it very easy to connect with only a restricted sample of people who holds similar opinions (see [[Filter bubble]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bowell|first=Tracy|date=2017-05-12|title=Response to the editorial 'Education in a post-truth world'|journal=Educational Philosophy and Theory|volume=49|issue=6|pages=582\u2013585|doi=10.1080/00131857.2017.1288805|issn=0013-1857|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism regarding whether or not those who contribute to a platform should be paid for their content.

In general, knowing who committed the online crime is difficult because many use pseudonyms or remain anonymous. Sometimes it can be traced back. But in the case of a public coffee shop, they have no way of pinpointing the exact user. There is also a problem with the issues surrounding extremely harmful but not legal acts.

In the United States, the \"[[Section 230]]\" exemptions of the [[Communications Decency Act]] state that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" This clause effectively provides a general immunity for websites that host user-generated content that is defamatory, deceptive or otherwise harmful, even if the operator knows that the third-party content is harmful and refuses to take it down.

They also studied the impact of content aliasing, sharing of multiple copies, and illegal uploads.<ref>[[Cha Meeyoung]] et al. \"I tube, you tube, everybody tubes: analyzing the world's largest user generated content video system.\" ''Internet Measurement Conference'' (2007).</ref>\n\nA study from [[York University]] in [[Ontario]] in 2012 conducted a research that resulted in a proposed framework for comparing brand-related UGC and to understand how the strategy used by a company could influence the brand sentiment across different social media channels including YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. The three scholars of this study examined two clothing brands, Lulu Lemon and American Apparel. The difference between these two brands is that Lulu Lemon had a social media following while American Apparel was the complete opposite with no social media following. Unsurprisingly, Lulu Lemon had much more positive contributions compared to American Apparel which had less positive contributions. Lulu Lemon has three times the number of positive contributions, 64 percent vs 22 percent for American Apparel on Twitter while on Facebook and YouTube, they had roughly an equal number of contributions. This proves that social media can influence how a brand is perceived, usually in a more positive light.<ref>{{cite journal |title=How Does Brand-related User-generated Content Differ across YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter? |journal=Journal of Interactive Marketing |year=2012 |last=Smith |first=Andrew |last2=Fischer |first2=Eileen |last3=Yongjian |first3=Chen |doi=10.1016/j.intmar.2012.01.002 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=102\u2013113}}</ref> A study by Dhar and Chang, published in 2007, found that the volume of blogs posted on a music album was positively correlated with future sales of that album.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Does Chatter Matter?

An example of an [[archaeological site]] of a cave dwelling is the [[Bashian Caves]] in [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]] which is dated from between 5,500 and 30,000 years. The actual cave itself has a height of around ten [[metre|meters]] and can accommodate some ten persons.\n\n===Stilt Housing===\n{{Main|Stilt house}}\nSpread over the vast prehistoric [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]] areas, stilt houses vary greatly. In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities. Apart from their cooling effect, stilt houses also have various functions such as avoiding [[miasma theory|miasma]], dampness, flood, and insects and snakes from entering, it is also easier to construct.\n\n===Stone Slab Housing===\n[[File:Paiwan.jpg|right|thumb|Stone slab house of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan tribe]] taken by Japanese anthropologist [[Ushinosuke Mori]] prior to 1945.]]\n\nThe [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] and [[Bunun people|Bunun]] tribes made houses using thatched roofing and made walls from stones, homes of nobles were decorated with elaborate wood carvings.

The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island. The fortresses were square shaped with an additional side for the installment of [[artillery]]. This period saw Taiwan architecture enter the peak of [[western culture|Western colonization]].

and churches in the north and south used to colonize and convert the inhabitants during the [[Dutch Taiwan|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Taiwan|Spanish]] period; the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning]] period when Taiwan was a base of [[anti-Qing sentiment]] and Minnan-style architecture was introduced; in [[Qing dynasty]] period, a mix of Chinese and Western architecture appeared and [[artillery battery]] flourished during Qing's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]; During the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]], the Minnan, [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Western culture|Western]] culture were main influencers in architectural designs and saw the introduction and use of [[reinforced concrete]]. Due to excessive Westernization as a colony, after the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] in 1945 from Japan at the end of World War II, Chinese classical style became popular and entered into international mainstream as a postmodern design style. Today, Taiwanese architecture has undergone much diversification, every style of architecture can be seen.<ref>[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/history/history.htm {{in lang|zh}} History of Taiwanese architecture]</ref>\n\n== Prehistory (-1621) ==\n{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}\nThe architecture of prehistoric Taiwan saw structures ranging from [[cave|cave dwellings]], [[stilt house|stilt housing]], to [[stone masonry]].

An example of an [[archaeological site]] of a cave dwelling is the [[Bashian Caves]] in [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]] which is dated from between 5,500 and 30,000 years. The actual cave itself has a height of around ten [[metre|meters]] and can accommodate some ten persons.\n\n===Stilt Housing===\n{{Main|Stilt house}}\nSpread over the vast prehistoric [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]] areas, stilt houses vary greatly. In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities. Apart from their cooling effect, stilt houses also have various functions such as avoiding [[miasma theory|miasma]], dampness, flood, and insects and snakes from entering, it is also easier to construct.\n\n===Stone Slab Housing===\n[[File:Paiwan.jpg|right|thumb|Stone slab house of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan tribe]] taken by Japanese anthropologist [[Ushinosuke Mori]] prior to 1945.]]\n\nThe [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] and [[Bunun people|Bunun]] tribes made houses using thatched roofing and made walls from stones, homes of nobles were decorated with elaborate wood carvings. The special characteristics of such houses is that dark colored building materials help conceal the buildings in its environment and the layered use of rocks mimic the scales of the [[Deinagkistrodon|hundred pacer snake]] that they worship.<ref>[http://www.e-tribe.org.tw/kungdavane/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabId=100 {{in lang|zh}} Kungdavane - Dead link]</ref>\n\n===Aboriginal Architecture===\n{{Main|Taiwanese aborigines}}\nChinese and aborigines made use of natural materials for basic construction materials such as straw, wood, bamboo, grass, stone, soil, etc. The types and styles vary depending on the environment, climate, and cultural influences of each tribe.

Most of the architecture in Taiwan from this period were dominated by fortresses, primarily the Dutch [[Fengguiwei Fort]], [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Fort Provintia]] in the south and the Spanish [[Fort San Domingo]] to the north. The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island. The fortresses were square shaped with an additional side for the installment of [[artillery]]. This period saw Taiwan architecture enter the peak of [[western culture|Western colonization]]. Such structures from this period represent the first generation of architectural works and is now listed as a world heritage by the Republic of China government.<ref>{{Cite web

Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC. Following the [[Gutian period]], there was a brief Sumerian Renaissance in the 21st century BC, cut short in the 20th century BC by invasions by the [[Amorites]].

It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of [[slave]] labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area\u2014from the [[Taurus Mountains]] in [[Turkey]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, and as far east as central [[Iran]].<ref name=\"Algaze, Guillermo 2005\">Algaze, Guillermo (2005) \"The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization\", (Second Edition, University of Chicago Press)</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists (like that found at [[Tell Brak]]), had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.<ref name=\"Algaze, Guillermo 2005\"/>\n\nSumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably [[theocratic]] and were most likely headed by a priest-king (''ensi''), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women.<ref name=Jacobsen>Jacobsen, Thorkild (Ed) (1939),\"The Sumerian King List\" (Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago; Assyriological Studies, No. 11., 1939)</ref> It is quite possible that the later Sumerian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as [[Alulim]] and [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumizid]].<ref name=Jacobsen/>\n\nThe end of the Uruk period coincided with the [[Piora oscillation]], a dry period from c. 3200\u20132900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the [[Holocene climatic optimum]].<ref>Lamb, Hubert H.

The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish (c. 26th century BC), whose name is also mentioned in the [[Gilgamesh epic]]\u2014leading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the Epic of Gilgamesh shows, this period was associated with increased war. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared.

Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of [[Sargon the Great]] (c. 2270\u20132215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the \"[[Neo-Sumerian]] Renaissance\" that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a \"Semitic vs. Sumerian\" conflict.<ref>''Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Mesopotamian History and Culture'' by T.

The last of these eventually came to briefly dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the [[Babylonian Empire]], just as the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] had already done so in the north from the late 21st century BC.

[[Soil salinity]] in this region had been long recognized as a major problem.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and [[Ur III]] phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of [[wheat]] to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]], but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson |first=William R. |year=2004 |title=Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation |journal=Journal of World Systems Research |url=http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf |doi=10.5195/jwsr.2004.288 |volume=10 |pages=612\u2013652 |issue=3 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219134627/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}</ref> This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language.

The [[Ubaid period]] pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via [[Choga Mami]] transitional ware to the pottery of the [[Samarra]] period culture (c. 5700\u20134900 BC [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14]]) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (''Oueilli'', ''Oueili'') near [[Larsa]], excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nOthers have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the [[bifacial]] assemblages found on the Arabian littoral.

The [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur III, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the ''lu-gal'' (\"great man\" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The \"''lu''\" or free person, and the slave (male, ''arad''; female ''geme''). The son of a ''lu'' was called a ''dumu-nita'' until he married. A woman (''munus'') went from being a daughter (''dumu-mi''), to a wife (''dam''), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (''numasu'') and she could then remarry another man who was from the same tribe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nMarriages were usually arranged by the parents of the bride and groom;<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets.<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father.<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} One Sumerian proverb describes the ideal, happy marriage through the mouth of a husband who boasts that his wife has borne him eight sons and is still eager to have sex.<ref name=\"NemetNejat\">{{citation|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/132 132]|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/132}}</ref>\n\nThe Sumerians generally seem to have discouraged [[premarital sex]],<ref>''Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece'' by Dale Launderville, p. 28</ref> but it was probably very commonly done in secret.<ref name=Kramer1963>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=The Univ. of Chicago Press|location=|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|url=https://archive.org/details/sumerianstheirhi00samu|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|78}} The Sumerians, as well as the later Akkadians, had no concept of [[virginity]].<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Jerrold S.|article=Virginity in Ancient Mesopotamia|title=Sex and Gender in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki|year=2001|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|url=http://krieger2.jhu.edu/neareast/pdf/jcooper/jc%20Virginity.pdf|isbn=978-951-45-9054-2|ref=harv}}</ref>{{rp|91\u201393}} When describing a woman's sexual inexperience, instead of calling her a \"virgin\", Sumerian texts describe which sex acts she had not yet performed.<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|92}} The Sumerians had no knowledge of the existence of the [[hymen]]<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|92}} and whether or not a prospective bride had engaged in [[sexual intercourse]] was entirely determined by her own word.<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nFrom the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex<ref name=\"Dening1996\">{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|chapter-url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyofsexan0000deni}}</ref> and their [[Sexual ethics|sexual mores]] were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean.<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> The Sumerians widely believed that [[masturbation]] enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and [[Mutual masturbation|with their partners]].<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> The Sumerians did not regard [[anal sex]] as taboo either.<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> ''Entu'' priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring<ref name=\"Leick2013\">{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York |page=219|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"NemetNejat\"/> and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of [[birth control]].<ref name=\"Leick2013\"/><ref name=\"Dening1996\"/><ref name=\"NemetNejat\"/>\n\nProstitution existed but it is not clear if [[sacred prostitution]] did.<ref name=Black/>{{rp|151}}\n\n===Language and writing===\n{{Main|History of writing|Sumerian language|Cuneiform}}\n[[File:P1150884_Louvre_Uruk_III_tablette_\u00e9criture_pr\u00e9cun\u00e9iforme_AO19936_rwk.jpg|thumb|Tablet with pictographic pre-cuneiform writing;

Sumerian writing is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. Although pictures\u2014that is, [[hieroglyphs]]\u2014were used first, cuneiform and then ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the [[Sumerian language]] have survived, such as personal and business letters, receipts, [[lexical lists]], laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of [[clay tablet]]s have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic speakers]] had become dominant.\n\nA prime example of cuneiform writing would be a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of [[Uruk]]. ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named [[Gilgamesh]] or \"Bilgamesh\" in Sumerian. The story is based around the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, [[Enkidu]]. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is claimed to be the earliest example of a fictional, written piece of literature discovered so far.\n\nThe Sumerian language is generally regarded as a [[language isolate]] in [[linguistics]] because it belongs to no known language family; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], by contrast, belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages]]. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other [[language family|language families]]. It is an [[agglutinative language]]; in other words, [[morpheme]]s (\"units of meaning\") are added together to create words, unlike [[analytic languages]] where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a [[substratum]] or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously [[Proto-Euphratean]] or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.\n\nUnderstanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an \"[[aide-m\u00e9moire]]\" for knowledgeable scribes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|last=Allan|first=Keith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-164343-9|location=Oxford|pages=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/> The influences between Sumerian on Akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scale\u2014and syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/> This mutual influence has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/>\n\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC,<ref name=\"woods\">Woods C. 2006 [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf \u201cBilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian\u201d].

The first saw creation as the result of a series of ''[[hieros gamos|hieroi gamoi]]'' or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings; the gods. This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus, in the later Akkadian [[Enuma Elish]], the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male [[Abzu]], and female [[Tiamat]]. The products of that union, [[Lahm]] and Lahmu, \"the muddy ones\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of [[Enki]], in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \"sky-pivot\" or axle, and the \"earth pivot\", parents in turn of [[Anu]] (the sky) and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (the earth). Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as [[Ninhursag]] or \"Lady of the Mountains\", and [[Enki]] of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.\n\nAt an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, [[Nippur]], in central Mesopotamia, replaced [[Eridu]] in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political [[hegemony]] on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.\n\n====Deities====\n[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian [[cylinder seal]] from sometime around 2300 BC or thereabouts depicting the deities [[Inanna]], [[Utu]], [[Enki]], and [[Isimud]].]]\nSumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later [[Mesopotamian mythology]], [[religion]], and [[astrology]].\n\nThe Sumerians worshiped:\n* [[Anu|An]] as the full-time god equivalent to heaven; indeed, the word ''an'' in Sumerian means sky and his consort [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], means earth.\n* [[Enki]] in the south at the temple in Eridu.

Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.\n\n====Cosmology====\nSumerians believed that the [[universe]] consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a [[dome]].

Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the [[podium]] and a [[mudbrick]] table for animal and vegetable [[sacrifice]]s. [[Granary|Granaries]] and [[Warehouse|storehouses]] were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.<ref>Mark M. Jarzombek and Vikramaditya Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'' (London: Wiley, 2011), 33-39. {{ISBN|9780470902486}}</ref>\n\n====Funerary practices====\nIt was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of [[Ereshkigal]], whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at [[Dilmun]].<ref name=\"Carl Phillips 2013\"/> [[Human sacrifice]] was found in the death pits at the [[Ur]] royal cemetery where Queen [[Puabi]] was accompanied in death by her servants.\n\n===Agriculture and hunting===\nThe Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as c. 5000 BC \u2013 4500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized [[irrigation]], large-scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]] involving the use of [[plough agriculture]], and the use of an agricultural [[Division of labour|specialized labour force]] under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).\n\n[[File:Ur mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|From the royal tombs of [[Ur]], made of [[lapis lazuli]] and shell, shows peacetime]]\nIn the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, cattle, and [[pig]]s were domesticated.

By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the ''[[shaduf]]'' was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.\"<ref name=\"Sayce\"/>\n[[File:Issue of barley rations.JPG|thumb|An account of barley rations issued monthly to adults and children written in [[cuneiform script]] on a clay tablet, written in year 4 of King [[Urukagina]], c. 2350 BC]]\nThe Sumerians were one of the first known [[beer]] drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] when [[Enkidu]] was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh's people: \"Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|publisher=Gotham Books|isbn=978-1-59240-303-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5 5]|year=2008|url=https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5}}</ref>\n\nThe Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mackenzie| first = Donald Alexander| year = 1927 | title = Footprints of Early Man| publisher = Blackie & Son Limited}}</ref> American anthropologist [[Robert McCormick Adams]] says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization,<ref>{{cite book| last = Adams| first = R.

The irrigation was accomplished by the use of ''[[shaduf]]'', [[canal]]s, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], [[weir]]s, and [[reservoirs]]. The frequent violent floods of the [[Tigris]], and less so, of the [[Euphrates]], meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of [[silt]], and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a [[corvee]], although the rich were able to exempt themselves.\n\nAs is known from the \"''[[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]]''\", after the flood season and after the [[Spring Equinox]] and the ''[[Akitu]]'' or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with [[pickaxe]]s. After drying, they [[plowing|plowed]], [[harrow (tool)|harrowed]], and [[rake (tool)|raked]] the ground three times, and pulverized it with a [[mattock]], before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]] as their principal crop.\n\nSumerians harvested during the [[spring (season)|spring]] in three-person teams consisting of a [[reaper]], a [[Reaper-binder|binder]], and a sheaf handler.<ref>By the sweat of thy brow: Work in the Western world, Melvin Kranzberg, Joseph Gies, Putnam, 1975</ref> The farmers would use [[threshing wagon]]s, driven by oxen, to separate the [[cereal]] heads from the [[stalk (botany)|stalks]] and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then [[winnowing|winnowed]] the grain/chaff mixture.\n\n===Art===\n{{see also|Stele of the Vultures|Royal Cemetery at Ur}}\n[[File:Royal Tombs of Ur Objects from tomb PG 580.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gold dagger from Sumerian tomb PG 580, [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]].]]\nThe Sumerians were great creators, nothing proving this more than their art. Sumerian artifacts show great detail and ornamentation, with fine semi-precious stones imported from other lands, such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[marble]], and [[diorite]], and precious metals like hammered gold, incorporated into the design. Since stone was rare it was reserved for sculpture. The most widespread material in Sumer was clay, as a result many Sumerina objects are made of clay. Metals such as gold, silver, copper, and bronze, along with shells and gemstones, were used for the finest sculpture and inlays. Small stones of all kinds, including more precious stones such as lapis lazuli, alabaster, and serpentine, were used for cylinder seals.\n \nSome of the most famous master pieces are the ''[[Lyres of Ur]]'', which are considered to be the world's oldest surviving [[stringed instrument]]s. They have been discovered by [[Leonard Woolley]] when the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]] has been excavated between from 1922 and 1934.\n{{clear}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCylinder seal and modern impression- ritual scene before a temple facade MET DP270679.jpg|Cylinder seal and impression in which appears a ritual scene before a temple fa\u00e7ade; 3500-3100 BC; bituminous limestone; height: 4.5&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nRaminathicket2.jpg|''[[Ram in a Thicket]]''; 2600-2400 BC; gold, copper, shell, lapis lazuli and limestone; height: 45.7&nbsp;cm; from the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq); [[British Museum]] (London)\nDenis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747049029) (2).jpg|''[[Standard of Ur]]''; 2600-2400 BC; shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli on wood; length: 49.5&nbsp;cm; from the Royal Cemetery at Ur; British Museum\nBull's head ornament for a lyre MET DP260070.jpg|Bull's head ornament from a lyre; 2600-2350 BC; bronze inlaid with shell and [[lapis lazuli]]; height: 13.3&nbsp;cm, width: 10.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Sumerian architecture|Ziggurat|Mudhif}}\n{{See also|Clay nail}}\n[[File:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|300px|thumb|The ''[[Great Ziggurat of Ur]]'' ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq), built during the Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian Renaissance), dedicated to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]]]\nThe Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex [[mudbrick]], not fixed with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[cement]]. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]], are found throughout the ancient Near East.\n\nAccording to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive [[pictogram]]s of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that \"Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones\u2014or rather bricks\u2014of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.\"<ref name=\"Sayce\">{{cite book| authorlink=Archibald Sayce| last=Sayce | first=Rev.

Sumerian [[Cylinder seal|cylinder]] [[Seal (device)|seals]] also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the [[Marsh Arabs]] of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the [[arch]], which enabled them to develop a strong type of [[dome]]. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[Alcove (architecture)|recesses]], [[Column|half columns]], and [[clay nail]]s.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Babylonian mathematics}}\nThe Sumerians developed a complex system of [[metrology]] c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the [[Babylonian numerals]] also date back to this period.<ref>Duncan J. Melville (2003).

For example, [[Imports to Ur]] came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.\n\nThe ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] from [[Lebanon]] was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen [[Puabi]] at [[Ur]], indicates it was traded from as far away as [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe Sumerians used [[Slavery in antiquity|slaves]], although they were not a major part of the economy.

Customarily, rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by [[Enmetena]] and [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] in 2400\u20132350 BC.

These early [[chariot]]s functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and [[lance]]s. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-[[wheel]]ed device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a [[basket|woven basket]] and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.\n\nSumerian cities were surrounded by defensive [[City wall|walls]].

This [[sexagesimal]] system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[archery|archers]]. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.\n\nFinally, the Sumerians ushered in [[domestication]] with intensive [[agriculture]] and [[irrigation]]. [[Emmer wheat]], [[barley]], sheep (starting as [[mouflon]]), and cattle (starting as [[aurochs]]) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised for the first time on a grand scale.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of writing numbers]]\n* [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement]]\n* [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]]\n* [[Indus-Mesopotamia relations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* Ascalone, Enrico. 2007.

Classical Sumer ends with the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the 23rd century BC.

It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of [[slave]] labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area\u2014from the [[Taurus Mountains]] in [[Turkey]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west, and as far east as central [[Iran]].<ref name=\"Algaze, Guillermo 2005\">Algaze, Guillermo (2005) \"The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization\", (Second Edition, University of Chicago Press)</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe Uruk period civilization, exported by Sumerian traders and colonists (like that found at [[Tell Brak]]), had an effect on all surrounding peoples, who gradually evolved their own comparable, competing economies and cultures. The cities of Sumer could not maintain remote, long-distance colonies by military force.<ref name=\"Algaze, Guillermo 2005\"/>\n\nSumerian cities during the Uruk period were probably [[theocratic]] and were most likely headed by a priest-king (''ensi''), assisted by a council of elders, including both men and women.<ref name=Jacobsen>Jacobsen, Thorkild (Ed) (1939),\"The Sumerian King List\" (Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago; Assyriological Studies, No. 11., 1939)</ref> It is quite possible that the later Sumerian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] was modeled upon this political structure. There was little evidence of organized warfare or professional soldiers during the Uruk period, and towns were generally unwalled. During this period Uruk became the most urbanized city in the world, surpassing for the first time 50,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe ancient Sumerian king list includes the early dynasties of several prominent cities from this period. The first set of names on the list is of kings said to have reigned before a major flood occurred. These early names may be fictional, and include some legendary and mythological figures, such as [[Alulim]] and [[Dumuzid, the Shepherd|Dumizid]].<ref name=Jacobsen/>\n\nThe end of the Uruk period coincided with the [[Piora oscillation]], a dry period from c. 3200\u20132900 BC that marked the end of a long wetter, warmer climate period from about 9,000 to 5,000 years ago, called the [[Holocene climatic optimum]].<ref>Lamb, Hubert H.

The earliest king authenticated through archaeological evidence is [[Enmebaragesi]] of Kish (c. 26th century BC), whose name is also mentioned in the [[Gilgamesh epic]]\u2014leading to the suggestion that Gilgamesh himself might have been a historical king of Uruk. As the Epic of Gilgamesh shows, this period was associated with increased war. Cities became walled, and increased in size as undefended villages in southern Mesopotamia disappeared.

Use of Old Akkadian was at its peak during the rule of [[Sargon the Great]] (c. 2270\u20132215 BC), but even then most administrative tablets continued to be written in Sumerian, the language used by the scribes. Gelb and Westenholz differentiate three stages of Old Akkadian: that of the pre-Sargonic era, that of the Akkadian empire, and that of the \"[[Neo-Sumerian]] Renaissance\" that followed it. Akkadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about one thousand years, but by around 1800 BC, Sumerian was becoming more of a literary language familiar mainly only to scholars and scribes. [[Thorkild Jacobsen]] has argued that there is little break in historical continuity between the pre- and post-Sargon periods, and that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a \"Semitic vs. Sumerian\" conflict.<ref>''Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Mesopotamian History and Culture'' by T.

The last of these eventually came to briefly dominate the south of Mesopotamia as the [[Babylonian Empire]], just as the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] had already done so in the north from the late 21st century BC. The Sumerian language continued as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria, much as Latin was used in the Medieval period, for as long as cuneiform was utilized.\n\n===Fall and transmission===\nThis period is generally taken to coincide with a major shift in population from southern Mesopotamia toward the north.

[[Soil salinity]] in this region had been long recognized as a major problem.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Poorly drained irrigated soils, in an arid climate with high levels of evaporation, led to the buildup of dissolved salts in the soil, eventually reducing agricultural yields severely. During the Akkadian and [[Ur III]] phases, there was a shift from the cultivation of [[wheat]] to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]], but this was insufficient, and during the period from 2100 BC to 1700 BC, it is estimated that the population in this area declined by nearly three fifths.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Thompson |first=William R. |year=2004 |title=Complexity, Diminishing Marginal Returns and Serial Mesopotamian Fragmentation |journal=Journal of World Systems Research |url=http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf |doi=10.5195/jwsr.2004.288 |volume=10 |pages=612\u2013652 |issue=3 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219134627/http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol10/number3/pdf/jwsr-v10n3-thompson.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2012 }}</ref> This greatly upset the balance of power within the region, weakening the areas where Sumerian was spoken, and comparatively strengthening those where Akkadian was the major language.

The [[Ubaid period]] pottery of southern Mesopotamia has been connected via [[Choga Mami]] transitional ware to the pottery of the [[Samarra]] period culture (c. 5700\u20134900 BC [[Radiocarbon dating|C-14]]) in the north, who were the first to practice a primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the middle Tigris River and its tributaries. The connection is most clearly seen at Tell Awayli (''Oueilli'', ''Oueili'') near [[Larsa]], excavated by the French in the 1980s, where eight levels yielded pre-Ubaid pottery resembling Samarran ware. According to this theory, farming peoples spread down into southern Mesopotamia because they had developed a temple-centered social organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control, enabling them to survive and prosper in a difficult environment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nOthers have suggested a continuity of Sumerians, from the indigenous hunter-fisherfolk traditions, associated with the [[bifacial]] assemblages found on the Arabian littoral.

The [[Code of Ur-Nammu]], the oldest such codification yet discovered, dating to the Ur III, reveals a glimpse at societal structure in late Sumerian law. Beneath the ''lu-gal'' (\"great man\" or king), all members of society belonged to one of two basic strata: The \"''lu''\" or free person, and the slave (male, ''arad''; female ''geme''). The son of a ''lu'' was called a ''dumu-nita'' until he married. A woman (''munus'') went from being a daughter (''dumu-mi''), to a wife (''dam''), then if she outlived her husband, a widow (''numasu'') and she could then remarry another man who was from the same tribe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nMarriages were usually arranged by the parents of the bride and groom;<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} engagements were usually completed through the approval of contracts recorded on clay tablets.<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} These marriages became legal as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to his bride's father.<ref name=Kramer1963/>{{rp|78}} One Sumerian proverb describes the ideal, happy marriage through the mouth of a husband who boasts that his wife has borne him eight sons and is still eager to have sex.<ref name=\"NemetNejat\">{{citation|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0-313-29497-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/132 132]|ref=harv|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinancie00neme/page/132}}</ref>\n\nThe Sumerians generally seem to have discouraged [[premarital sex]],<ref>''Celibacy in the Ancient World: Its Ideal and Practice in Pre-Hellenistic Israel, Mesopotamia, and Greece'' by Dale Launderville, p. 28</ref> but it was probably very commonly done in secret.<ref name=Kramer1963>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=The Univ. of Chicago Press|location=|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|url=https://archive.org/details/sumerianstheirhi00samu|url-access=registration}}</ref>{{rp|78}} The Sumerians, as well as the later Akkadians, had no concept of [[virginity]].<ref name=\"Cooper\">{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Jerrold S.|article=Virginity in Ancient Mesopotamia|title=Sex and Gender in the Ancient Near East: Proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki|year=2001|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|url=http://krieger2.jhu.edu/neareast/pdf/jcooper/jc%20Virginity.pdf|isbn=978-951-45-9054-2|ref=harv}}</ref>{{rp|91\u201393}} When describing a woman's sexual inexperience, instead of calling her a \"virgin\", Sumerian texts describe which sex acts she had not yet performed.<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|92}} The Sumerians had no knowledge of the existence of the [[hymen]]<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|92}} and whether or not a prospective bride had engaged in [[sexual intercourse]] was entirely determined by her own word.<ref name=\"Cooper\"/>{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nFrom the earliest records, the Sumerians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex<ref name=\"Dening1996\">{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|chapter-url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyofsexan0000deni}}</ref> and their [[Sexual ethics|sexual mores]] were determined not by whether a sexual act was deemed immoral, but rather by whether or not it made a person ritually unclean.<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> The Sumerians widely believed that [[masturbation]] enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and [[Mutual masturbation|with their partners]].<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> The Sumerians did not regard [[anal sex]] as taboo either.<ref name=\"Dening1996\"/> ''Entu'' priestesses were forbidden from producing offspring<ref name=\"Leick2013\">{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York |page=219|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"NemetNejat\"/> and frequently engaged in anal sex as a method of [[birth control]].<ref name=\"Leick2013\"/><ref name=\"Dening1996\"/><ref name=\"NemetNejat\"/>\n\nProstitution existed but it is not clear if [[sacred prostitution]] did.<ref name=Black/>{{rp|151}}\n\n===Language and writing===\n{{Main|History of writing|Sumerian language|Cuneiform}}\n[[File:P1150884_Louvre_Uruk_III_tablette_\u00e9criture_pr\u00e9cun\u00e9iforme_AO19936_rwk.jpg|thumb|Tablet with pictographic pre-cuneiform writing;

Sumerian writing is considered to be a great milestone in the development of humanity's ability to not only create historical records but also in creating pieces of literature, both in the form of poetic epics and stories as well as prayers and laws. Although pictures\u2014that is, [[hieroglyphs]]\u2014were used first, cuneiform and then ideograms (where symbols were made to represent ideas) soon followed. Triangular or wedge-shaped reeds were used to write on moist clay. A large body of hundreds of thousands of texts in the [[Sumerian language]] have survived, such as personal and business letters, receipts, [[lexical lists]], laws, hymns, prayers, stories, and daily records. Full libraries of [[clay tablet]]s have been found. Monumental inscriptions and texts on different objects, like statues or bricks, are also very common. Many texts survive in multiple copies because they were repeatedly transcribed by scribes in training. Sumerian continued to be the language of religion and law in Mesopotamia long after [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic speakers]] had become dominant.\n\nA prime example of cuneiform writing would be a lengthy poem that was discovered in the ruins of [[Uruk]]. ''[[The Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' was written in the standard Sumerian cuneiform. It tells of a king from the early Dynastic II period named [[Gilgamesh]] or \"Bilgamesh\" in Sumerian. The story is based around the fictional adventures of Gilgamesh and his companion, [[Enkidu]]. It was laid out on several clay tablets and is claimed to be the earliest example of a fictional, written piece of literature discovered so far.\n\nThe Sumerian language is generally regarded as a [[language isolate]] in [[linguistics]] because it belongs to no known language family; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], by contrast, belongs to the [[Semitic languages|Semitic branch]] of the [[Afroasiatic languages]]. There have been many failed attempts to connect Sumerian to other [[language family|language families]]. It is an [[agglutinative language]]; in other words, [[morpheme]]s (\"units of meaning\") are added together to create words, unlike [[analytic languages]] where morphemes are purely added together to create sentences. Some authors have proposed that there may be evidence of a [[substratum]] or adstratum language for geographic features and various crafts and agricultural activities, called variously [[Proto-Euphratean]] or Proto Tigrean, but this is disputed by others.\n\nUnderstanding Sumerian texts today can be problematic. Most difficult are the earliest texts, which in many cases do not give the full grammatical structure of the language and seem to have been used as an \"[[aide-m\u00e9moire]]\" for knowledgeable scribes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics|last=Allan|first=Keith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-164343-9|location=Oxford|pages=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 3rd millennium BC a cultural symbiosis developed between the Sumerians and the Akkadians, which included widespread [[bilingualism]].<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/> The influences between Sumerian on Akkadian are evident in all areas including lexical borrowing on a massive scale\u2014and syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/> This mutual influence has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian of the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[Sprachbund]]''.<ref name=\"Deutscher\"/>\n\nAkkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as a spoken language somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC,<ref name=\"woods\">Woods C. 2006 [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf \u201cBilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian\u201d].

The first saw creation as the result of a series of ''[[hieros gamos|hieroi gamoi]]'' or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings; the gods. This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus, in the later Akkadian [[Enuma Elish]], the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male [[Abzu]], and female [[Tiamat]]. The products of that union, [[Lahm]] and Lahmu, \"the muddy ones\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of [[Enki]], in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \"sky-pivot\" or axle, and the \"earth pivot\", parents in turn of [[Anu]] (the sky) and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (the earth). Another important Sumerian hieros gamos was that between Ki, here known as [[Ninhursag]] or \"Lady of the Mountains\", and [[Enki]] of Eridu, the god of fresh water which brought forth greenery and pasture.\n\nAt an early stage, following the dawn of recorded history, [[Nippur]], in central Mesopotamia, replaced [[Eridu]] in the south as the primary temple city, whose priests exercised political [[hegemony]] on the other city-states. Nippur retained this status throughout the Sumerian period.\n\n====Deities====\n[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian [[cylinder seal]] from sometime around 2300 BC or thereabouts depicting the deities [[Inanna]], [[Utu]], [[Enki]], and [[Isimud]].]]\nSumerians believed in an anthropomorphic polytheism, or the belief in many gods in human form. There was no common set of gods; each city-state had its own patrons, temples, and priest-kings. Nonetheless, these were not exclusive; the gods of one city were often acknowledged elsewhere. Sumerian speakers were among the earliest people to record their beliefs in writing, and were a major inspiration in later [[Mesopotamian mythology]], [[religion]], and [[astrology]].\n\nThe Sumerians worshiped:\n* [[Anu|An]] as the full-time god equivalent to heaven; indeed, the word ''an'' in Sumerian means sky and his consort [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], means earth.\n* [[Enki]] in the south at the temple in Eridu.

Citizens had a labor duty to the temple, though they could avoid it by a payment of silver.\n\n====Cosmology====\nSumerians believed that the [[universe]] consisted of a flat disk enclosed by a [[dome]].

Flanking the aisles would be rooms for the priests. At one end would stand the [[podium]] and a [[mudbrick]] table for animal and vegetable [[sacrifice]]s. [[Granary|Granaries]] and [[Warehouse|storehouses]] were usually located near the temples. After a time the Sumerians began to place the temples on top of multi-layered square constructions built as a series of rising terraces, giving rise to the Ziggurat style.<ref>Mark M. Jarzombek and Vikramaditya Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'' (London: Wiley, 2011), 33-39. {{ISBN|9780470902486}}</ref>\n\n====Funerary practices====\nIt was believed that when people died, they would be confined to a gloomy world of [[Ereshkigal]], whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and a small amount of food. Those who could afford it sought burial at [[Dilmun]].<ref name=\"Carl Phillips 2013\"/> [[Human sacrifice]] was found in the death pits at the [[Ur]] royal cemetery where Queen [[Puabi]] was accompanied in death by her servants.\n\n===Agriculture and hunting===\nThe Sumerians adopted an agricultural lifestyle perhaps as early as c. 5000 BC \u2013 4500 BC. The region demonstrated a number of core agricultural techniques, including organized [[irrigation]], large-scale intensive cultivation of land, [[mono-cropping]] involving the use of [[plough agriculture]], and the use of an agricultural [[Division of labour|specialized labour force]] under bureaucratic control. The necessity to manage temple accounts with this organization led to the development of [[history of writing|writing]] (c. 3500 BC).\n\n[[File:Ur mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|From the royal tombs of [[Ur]], made of [[lapis lazuli]] and shell, shows peacetime]]\nIn the early Sumerian Uruk period, the primitive pictograms suggest that [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, cattle, and [[pig]]s were domesticated.

By the side of the house was an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and probably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the ''[[shaduf]]'' was already employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown in pots or vases.\"<ref name=\"Sayce\"/>\n[[File:Issue of barley rations.JPG|thumb|An account of barley rations issued monthly to adults and children written in [[cuneiform script]] on a clay tablet, written in year 4 of King [[Urukagina]], c. 2350 BC]]\nThe Sumerians were one of the first known [[beer]] drinking societies. Cereals were plentiful and were the key ingredient in their early brew. They brewed multiple kinds of beer consisting of wheat, barley, and mixed grain beers. Beer brewing was very important to the Sumerians. It was referenced in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] when [[Enkidu]] was introduced to the food and beer of Gilgamesh's people: \"Drink the beer, as is the custom of the land... He drank the beer-seven jugs! and became expansive and sang with joy!\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|publisher=Gotham Books|isbn=978-1-59240-303-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5 5]|year=2008|url=https://archive.org/details/drinkculturalhis00gate_0/page/5}}</ref>\n\nThe Sumerians practiced similar irrigation techniques as those used in Egypt.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mackenzie| first = Donald Alexander| year = 1927 | title = Footprints of Early Man| publisher = Blackie & Son Limited}}</ref> American anthropologist [[Robert McCormick Adams]] says that irrigation development was associated with urbanization,<ref>{{cite book| last = Adams| first = R.

The irrigation was accomplished by the use of ''[[shaduf]]'', [[canal]]s, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[dyke (construction)|dykes]], [[weir]]s, and [[reservoirs]]. The frequent violent floods of the [[Tigris]], and less so, of the [[Euphrates]], meant that canals required frequent repair and continual removal of [[silt]], and survey markers and boundary stones needed to be continually replaced. The government required individuals to work on the canals in a [[corvee]], although the rich were able to exempt themselves.\n\nAs is known from the \"''[[Sumerian Farmer's Almanac]]''\", after the flood season and after the [[Spring Equinox]] and the ''[[Akitu]]'' or New Year Festival, using the canals, farmers would flood their fields and then drain the water. Next they made oxen stomp the ground and kill weeds. They then dragged the fields with [[pickaxe]]s. After drying, they [[plowing|plowed]], [[harrow (tool)|harrowed]], and [[rake (tool)|raked]] the ground three times, and pulverized it with a [[mattock]], before planting seed. Unfortunately, the high evaporation rate resulted in a gradual increase in the salinity of the fields. By the Ur III period, farmers had switched from wheat to the more salt-tolerant [[barley]] as their principal crop.\n\nSumerians harvested during the [[spring (season)|spring]] in three-person teams consisting of a [[reaper]], a [[Reaper-binder|binder]], and a sheaf handler.<ref>By the sweat of thy brow: Work in the Western world, Melvin Kranzberg, Joseph Gies, Putnam, 1975</ref> The farmers would use [[threshing wagon]]s, driven by oxen, to separate the [[cereal]] heads from the [[stalk (botany)|stalks]] and then use threshing sleds to disengage the grain. They then [[winnowing|winnowed]] the grain/chaff mixture.\n\n===Art===\n{{see also|Stele of the Vultures|Royal Cemetery at Ur}}\n[[File:Royal Tombs of Ur Objects from tomb PG 580.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gold dagger from Sumerian tomb PG 580, [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]].]]\nThe Sumerians were great creators, nothing proving this more than their art. Sumerian artifacts show great detail and ornamentation, with fine semi-precious stones imported from other lands, such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[marble]], and [[diorite]], and precious metals like hammered gold, incorporated into the design. Since stone was rare it was reserved for sculpture. The most widespread material in Sumer was clay, as a result many Sumerina objects are made of clay. Metals such as gold, silver, copper, and bronze, along with shells and gemstones, were used for the finest sculpture and inlays. Small stones of all kinds, including more precious stones such as lapis lazuli, alabaster, and serpentine, were used for cylinder seals.\n \nSome of the most famous master pieces are the ''[[Lyres of Ur]]'', which are considered to be the world's oldest surviving [[stringed instrument]]s. They have been discovered by [[Leonard Woolley]] when the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]] has been excavated between from 1922 and 1934.\n{{clear}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCylinder seal and modern impression- ritual scene before a temple facade MET DP270679.jpg|Cylinder seal and impression in which appears a ritual scene before a temple fa\u00e7ade; 3500-3100 BC; bituminous limestone; height: 4.5&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nRaminathicket2.jpg|''[[Ram in a Thicket]]''; 2600-2400 BC; gold, copper, shell, lapis lazuli and limestone; height: 45.7&nbsp;cm; from the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq); [[British Museum]] (London)\nDenis Bourez - British Museum, London (8747049029) (2).jpg|''[[Standard of Ur]]''; 2600-2400 BC; shell, red limestone and lapis lazuli on wood; length: 49.5&nbsp;cm; from the Royal Cemetery at Ur; British Museum\nBull's head ornament for a lyre MET DP260070.jpg|Bull's head ornament from a lyre; 2600-2350 BC; bronze inlaid with shell and [[lapis lazuli]]; height: 13.3&nbsp;cm, width: 10.5&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Sumerian architecture|Ziggurat|Mudhif}}\n{{See also|Clay nail}}\n[[File:Ancient ziggurat at Ali Air Base Iraq 2005.jpg|300px|thumb|The ''[[Great Ziggurat of Ur]]'' ([[Dhi Qar Governorate]], Iraq), built during the Third Dynasty of Ur (Sumerian Renaissance), dedicated to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]]]\nThe Tigris-Euphrates plain lacked minerals and trees. Sumerian structures were made of plano-convex [[mudbrick]], not fixed with [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or [[cement]]. Mud-brick buildings eventually deteriorate, so they were periodically destroyed, leveled, and rebuilt on the same spot. This constant rebuilding gradually raised the level of cities, which thus came to be elevated above the surrounding plain. The resultant hills, known as [[Tell (archaeology)|tells]], are found throughout the ancient Near East.\n\nAccording to [[Archibald Sayce]], the primitive [[pictogram]]s of the early Sumerian (i.e. Uruk) era suggest that \"Stone was scarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities, forts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with towers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a tower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a hinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a larger scale, and seems to have been double. The foundation stones\u2014or rather bricks\u2014of a house were consecrated by certain objects that were deposited under them.\"<ref name=\"Sayce\">{{cite book| authorlink=Archibald Sayce| last=Sayce | first=Rev.

Sumerian [[Cylinder seal|cylinder]] [[Seal (device)|seals]] also depict houses built from reeds not unlike those built by the [[Marsh Arabs]] of Southern Iraq until as recently as 400 CE. The Sumerians also developed the [[arch]], which enabled them to develop a strong type of [[dome]]. They built this by constructing and linking several arches. Sumerian temples and palaces made use of more advanced materials and techniques, such as [[buttress]]es, [[Alcove (architecture)|recesses]], [[Column|half columns]], and [[clay nail]]s.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Babylonian mathematics}}\nThe Sumerians developed a complex system of [[metrology]] c. 4000 BC. This advanced metrology resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. From c. 2600 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote [[multiplication table]]s on clay tablets and dealt with [[geometry|geometrical]] exercises and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] problems. The earliest traces of the [[Babylonian numerals]] also date back to this period.<ref>Duncan J. Melville (2003).

For example, [[Imports to Ur]] came from many parts of the world. In particular, the metals of all types had to be imported.\n\nThe ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' refers to trade with far lands for goods, such as wood, that were scarce in Mesopotamia. In particular, [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] from [[Lebanon]] was prized. The finding of resin in the tomb of Queen [[Puabi]] at [[Ur]], indicates it was traded from as far away as [[Mozambique]].\n\nThe Sumerians used [[Slavery in antiquity|slaves]], although they were not a major part of the economy.

Customarily, rulers did it at the beginning of the first full year of their reign, but they could also be proclaimed at times of military conflict or crop failure. The first known ones were made by [[Enmetena]] and [[Urukagina]] of [[Lagash]] in 2400\u20132350 BC.

These early [[chariot]]s functioned less effectively in combat than did later designs, and some have suggested that these chariots served primarily as transports, though the crew carried battle-axes and [[lance]]s. The Sumerian chariot comprised a four or two-[[wheel]]ed device manned by a crew of two and harnessed to four onagers. The cart was composed of a [[basket|woven basket]] and the wheels had a solid three-piece design.\n\nSumerian cities were surrounded by defensive [[City wall|walls]].

This [[sexagesimal]] system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[archery|archers]]. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.\n\nFinally, the Sumerians ushered in [[domestication]] with intensive [[agriculture]] and [[irrigation]]. [[Emmer wheat]], [[barley]], sheep (starting as [[mouflon]]), and cattle (starting as [[aurochs]]) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised for the first time on a grand scale.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Iraq]]\n* [[History of writing numbers]]\n* [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement]]\n* [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion]]\n* [[Indus-Mesopotamia relations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* Ascalone, Enrico. 2007.

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]]. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and [[whole blood]] were used.\n\n=== The Origin of Plasmapheresis ===\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grifols.com/documents/51507592/51526363/when-a-dream-comes-true.pdf/c0ebb294-4db1-4826-95b6-e9468aa9305c|title=When a Dream Comes True|date=January 2015|website=grifols.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovertheplasma.com/documents/15447917/15449136/biography_ja_grifols.pdf/036f08c5-630b-4e4b-b590-985b4e951495|title=Biography: J.A.

This technique is still in practice today, almost 80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma donation center.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr. Grifols unexpectedly passed away at the young age of 41 due to leukemia. \n\n===Blood for Britain===  <!-- subject of redirect -->\nThe \"Blood for Britain\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (human classification)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]].

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However, plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma medicines.\n\n==Synthetic blood plasma==\n[[Simulated body fluid]] (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma.

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]]. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and [[whole blood]] were used.\n\n=== The Origin of Plasmapheresis ===\nDr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Grifols Lucas, a scientist from Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grifols.com/documents/51507592/51526363/when-a-dream-comes-true.pdf/c0ebb294-4db1-4826-95b6-e9468aa9305c|title=When a Dream Comes True|date=January 2015|website=grifols.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, founded Laboratorios Grifols in 1940<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovertheplasma.com/documents/15447917/15449136/biography_ja_grifols.pdf/036f08c5-630b-4e4b-b590-985b4e951495|title=Biography: J.A. Grifols|website=discovertheplasma.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Dr. Grifols pioneered a first-of-its-kind technique called ''plasmapheresis''<ref name=\":12\" />, where a donor's red blood cells would be returned to the donor's body almost immediately after the separation of the blood plasma. This technique is still in practice today, almost 80 years later. In 1945, Dr. Grifols opened the world's first plasma donation center.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thirteen years after the center's opening, Dr. Grifols unexpectedly passed away at the young age of 41 due to leukemia. \n\n===Blood for Britain===  <!-- subject of redirect -->\nThe \"Blood for Britain\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on [[Charles R. Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the [[Race (human classification)|race]] of the [[blood donation|donor]]. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for \"same race\" blood.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hirsch|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Donald Hirsch, Jr.|title=What Your 1st Grader Needs to Know: Fundamentals of a Good First-Grade Education|url=https://archive.org/details/whatyour3rdgrade00edhi|url-access=registration|publisher=New York: Doubleday|series=pp 232\u2013233|year=1991|doi= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the war the [[American Red Cross]] had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. [[Serum albumin]] replaced dried plasma for combat use during the [[Korean War]].<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter11.htm The Plasma Program]</ref>\n\n==Plasma donation==\nPlasma as a [[blood product]] prepared from [[blood donation]]s is used in [[blood transfusion]]s, typically as [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or [[plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy]] (PF24). When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate). However, plasma from UK donors is still not used for the commercial manufacture of fractionated plasma medicines.\n\n==Synthetic blood plasma==\n[[Simulated body fluid]] (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma. SBF is normally used for the surface modification of metallic implants, and more recently in [[gene delivery]] application.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Blood plasma fractionation]]\n*[[Blood proteins]]\n*[[Chromatography in blood processing]]\n*[[Hypoxia preconditioned plasma]]\n*[[Intravascular volume status]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n{{blood}}\n\n[[Category:Blood]]\n[[Category:Blood products]]\n[[Category:Body fluids]]\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Bammie73", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_plasma"}
