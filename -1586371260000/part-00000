Pratt was a pioneer of the U.S. [[petroleum industry]], and he established his [[kerosene]] refinery [[Astral Oil Works]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York. He then lived with his growing family in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]]. He recruited [[Henry Huttleston Rogers|Henry H. Rogers]] into his business, forming [[Charles Pratt and Company]] in 1867. Seven years later, Pratt and Rogers agreed to join [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]].\n\nAn advocate of education, Pratt founded and endowed the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, now a renowned art college. He and his children built country estates in [[Glen Cove, New York]], which became known as the [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]] in the 1920s on the North Shore of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]]. In 1916, Standard Oil had a steamship tanker, the first of its class, built at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and it was named in honor of Pratt.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCharles Pratt was born in [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]],<ref name=watertown-obit>{{cite journal|title=Obituary Charles Pratt|journal=Watertown Daily Times|date=May 6, 1891|page=4}}</ref> as one of eleven children. He was the son of Elizabeth Stone and Asa Pratt, a carpenter. He spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy (now [[Wilbraham & Monson Academy]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Whale oil, petroleum, Astral Oil===\nAs a young man, Pratt joined a company in nearby [[Boston]], Massachusetts, that specialized in paints and [[whale oil]] products. In 1850 or 1851, he moved to New York City, where he worked for a similar company.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Pratt realized that whale oil could be replaced by petroleum (\"natural oil\") distillates to light lamps. He became a pioneer of the [[petroleum industry]] as new wells were established during the 1860s in western Pennsylvania.<ref name=b-guide/> In the 1860s, he founded his [[kerosene]] refinery, [[Astral Oil Works]], in [[Brooklyn]], New York. One advertising slogan was \"The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil.\"<ref name=b-guide>[http://www.brooklyn.net/neighborhoods/greenpoint.html Brooklyn Pratt Works] 1939 WPA Guide to New York City</ref>\n\n===Henry H. Rogers, Charles Pratt and Company===\nPratt and his future business partner [[Henry Huttleston Rogers|Henry H. Rogers]] became acquainted while doing business in the oil fields of Pennsylvania.<ref name=d-personality/> In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two young men, Charles Ellis and Rogers, in the area of the new oil fields of [[Venango County, Pennsylvania|Venango County]] in western Pennsylvania. Previously, Pratt had bought whale oil from Ellis in [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], his and Rogers' coastal hometown. They struck a deal and pre-sold the entire output of their small venture, [[Wamsutta Oil Refinery]], to Pratt's company at a fixed price.  But, Ellis and Rogers soon were heavily in debt to Pratt.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City to say he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. Impressed, Pratt immediately hired Rogers for his own organization.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After five years in the oil fields, in 1866 Pratt asked Rogers to come to the Brooklyn side of the business, where Rogers worked for the next eight years.<ref name=d-personality/> Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over $50,000 annually.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1867, with Rogers as a partner, Pratt established the firm of [[Charles Pratt and Company]]. According to [[Elbert Hubbard]], a journalist, in the next few years Rogers became Pratt's \"hands and feet and eyes and ears.\"<ref name=\"little_journeys\">[http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=23595 Elbert Hubbard, ''Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great, Vol. 11, Great Businessmen''], Roycoft, 1909, at Project Gutenberg, online books at University of Pennsylvania.

Rockefeller]]'s [[South Improvement Company]].  Rockefeller had obtained favorable net rates from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. His actions outraged independent oil producers and refineries in western Pennsylvania and other areas. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] to consult with the Oil Producers' Union.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and his associates forged an agreement with the PRR and other railroads; the railroads eventually agreed to open rates to all and promised to end their special dealings with South Improvement. The oil men felt victorious, but Rockefeller had already begun to buy up opposing interests in the formation of [[Standard Oil]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Standard Oil Trust 1883.JPG|left|thumb|400px|Share of the Standard Oil Trust, issued 18.

Pratt and Rogers decided that the plan would benefit their business plans. Rogers formulated terms which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and him, which Rockefeller accepted.

Pratt was a pioneer of the U.S. [[petroleum industry]], and he established his [[kerosene]] refinery [[Astral Oil Works]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York. He then lived with his growing family in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]]. He recruited [[Henry Huttleston Rogers|Henry H. Rogers]] into his business, forming [[Charles Pratt and Company]] in 1867. Seven years later, Pratt and Rogers agreed to join [[John D. Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]].\n\nAn advocate of education, Pratt founded and endowed the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn, now a renowned art college. He and his children built country estates in [[Glen Cove, New York]], which became known as the [[North Shore (Long Island)|Gold Coast]] in the 1920s on the North Shore of [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]]. In 1916, Standard Oil had a steamship tanker, the first of its class, built at [[Newport News, Virginia]], and it was named in honor of Pratt.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCharles Pratt was born in [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts]],<ref name=watertown-obit>{{cite journal|title=Obituary Charles Pratt|journal=Watertown Daily Times|date=May 6, 1891|page=4}}</ref> as one of eleven children.

He spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy (now [[Wilbraham & Monson Academy]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Whale oil, petroleum, Astral Oil===\nAs a young man, Pratt joined a company in nearby [[Boston]], Massachusetts, that specialized in paints and [[whale oil]] products. In 1850 or 1851, he moved to New York City, where he worked for a similar company.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Pratt realized that whale oil could be replaced by petroleum (\"natural oil\") distillates to light lamps. He became a pioneer of the [[petroleum industry]] as new wells were established during the 1860s in western Pennsylvania.<ref name=b-guide/> In the 1860s, he founded his [[kerosene]] refinery, [[Astral Oil Works]], in [[Brooklyn]], New York.

Previously, Pratt had bought whale oil from Ellis in [[Fairhaven, Massachusetts]], his and Rogers' coastal hometown. They struck a deal and pre-sold the entire output of their small venture, [[Wamsutta Oil Refinery]], to Pratt's company at a fixed price.  But, Ellis and Rogers soon were heavily in debt to Pratt.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City to say he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. Impressed, Pratt immediately hired Rogers for his own organization.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After five years in the oil fields, in 1866 Pratt asked Rogers to come to the Brooklyn side of the business, where Rogers worked for the next eight years.<ref name=d-personality/> Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over $50,000 annually.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1867, with Rogers as a partner, Pratt established the firm of [[Charles Pratt and Company]].

His actions outraged independent oil producers and refineries in western Pennsylvania and other areas. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] to consult with the Oil Producers' Union.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and his associates forged an agreement with the PRR and other railroads; the railroads eventually agreed to open rates to all and promised to end their special dealings with South Improvement.

Herbert was 74 when the novel was published, and it secured his financial security for the remainder of his life<ref>De Groen 1998, p.249</ref>. \n\nIn [[1980]], the novel was translated into [[Japanese language|Japanese]] by Professor Michio Ochi in 11 volumes, under the title of <i>Kawais\u00f4 na watashi no kuni </i>. <ref>{{cite journal |last=Arimitsu |first=Yasue |date=June 2011 |title=The Contemporary State of Academic Appraisal of Australian Literature in Japanese Universities |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41957919?seq=1 |journal=Antipodes |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=7-13 |access-date=1 February 2020 }}</ref> <ref>[http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?lg=0&c=JPN&fr=3640 Index Translationum, accessed 1 February 2020]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe book sold 30,000 copies within a year of publication and 70,000 within five years, rendering it a success in Australian literary terms<ref>De Groen 1998, p.245</ref>. Australian reviewers were mixed but overall positive<ref>De Groen 1998, p.245-246</ref>. The [[Adelaide Advertiser]] review was entitled \"A Passionate Cry for a Land and a People\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Elliott |first=Brian |date=13 September 1975 |title=A Passionate Cry for a Land and a People | work=Adelaide Advertiser }}</ref>, while the [[Courier-Mail]] called it a \"big blockbuster\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Rowbotham |first=David |date=13 September 1975 |title=Big Blockbuster from Herbert |work=Courier-Mail }}</ref>. Historian [[Manning Clark]], in the [[Canberra Times]], however, titled his review \"Artist Turns Angry Prophet\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Manning |date=12 September 1975 |title=Artist Turns Angry Prophet |work=Canberra Times }}</ref>. The [[Sydney Morning Herald]] ran two conflicting reviews: one entitled \"Compelling Power\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Harrison-Ford |first=Carl |date=13 September 1975 |title=Compelling Power |work=Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref> and the other \"Foaming River of Prose\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Farwell |first=George |date=13 September 1975 |title=Foaming River of Prose |work=Sydney Morning Herald }}</ref>. Much criticism centered on the novel's length, with the reviewer for the [[Nation Review]] joking about \"poor fellow Xavier Herbert's typewriter\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hepworth |first=John |date=17-23 October 1975 |title=Poor Fellow Xavier Herbert's Typewriter |work=Nation Review }}</ref>.\n\nReaction to the book was more muted from some of Herbert's fellow writers. [[Randolph Stow]] thought that <i>Poor Fellow My Country</i> might be \"<i>the</i> Australian classic\" but expressed reservations at the character of Jeremy Delacy, who \"is a bore on a colossal scale\", and whom Stow believed to be a mouthpiece for Herbert's views rather than a character<ref>De Groen 1998, p.246</ref>. [[Patrick White]], Australia's only [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel laureate]], admitted privately that in spite of the \"beautiful landscapes\", he found it full of \"cartoon dialogue and cartoon characters\" and would never read the entire novel<ref>De Groen 1998, p.255</ref>.\n\nThe novel won the 1976 [[Miles Franklin Award]], beating [[Frank Hardy]]'s ''[[But the Dead Are Many]]'' and [[Thomas Keneally]]'s ''[[Gossip from the Forest]]'' <ref>De Groen 1998, p.249</ref>.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.xavier-herbert-novels.com A book on Herbert's novels at www.xavier-herbert-novels.com.
