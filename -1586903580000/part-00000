It was premiered in 1941. The piece is scored for [[clarinet]] (in B-flat), [[violin]], [[cello]], and [[piano]]; a typical performance of the complete work lasts about 50 minutes.

It has come to be recognized as one of his most important works.\n\n==Composition and first performance==\nMessiaen was 31 years old when France entered [[World War II]]. He was captured by the German army in June 1940 and imprisoned in [[Stalag VIII-A]], a prisoner-of-war camp in [[G\u00f6rlitz]], Germany (now [[Zgorzelec]], [[Poland]]).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Life of Messiaen|last=Dingle|first=Christopher|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-521-63547-0|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=68-70|via=}}</ref> While in transit to the camp, Messiaen showed the clarinetist [[Henri Akoka]], also a prisoner, the sketches for what would become ''Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux''.

And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer: But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished ...</blockquote>\n\n==Structure==\nThe work is in eight [[Movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman\n|\"Liturgie de cristal\" (Crystal [[liturgy]])\n|\"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" ([[Vocalise]], for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\" (Abyss of birds)\n|\"Interm\u00e8de\" ([[Intermezzo|Interlude]])\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the eternity of Jesus)\n|\"Danse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\" (Dance of fury, for the seven trumpets)\n|\"Fouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" (Tangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time)\n|\"Louange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (Praise to the immortality of Jesus)\n}}\nBelow, quotations are translated from Messiaen's Preface to the score.\n\n===I. \"Liturgie de cristal\"===\nIn his preface to the score, Messiaen describes the opening of the quartet:\n\n{{quote|Between three and four in the morning, the awakening of birds: a solo blackbird or nightingale improvises, surrounded by a shimmer of sound, by a halo of trills lost very high in the trees. Transpose this onto a religious plane and you have the harmonious silence of Heaven.}}\nWritten for the full quartet, the opening movement begins with the solo clarinet imitating a blackbird's song and the violin imitating a nightingale\u2019s song. The underlying pulse is provided by the cello and piano: the cello cycles through the same five-note melody (using the pitches C, E, D, F-sharp, and B-flat) and a repeating pattern of 15 durations. The piano part consists of a 17-note rhythmic pattern permuted strictly through 29 chords, as if to give the listener a glimpse of something eternal.\n\n===II. \"Vocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\"===\nAlso for the full quartet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|The first and third parts (very short) evoke the power of this mighty angel, a rainbow upon his head and clothed with a cloud, who sets one foot on the sea and one foot on the earth. In the middle section are the impalpable harmonies of heaven. In the piano, sweet cascades of blue-orange chords, enclosing in their distant chimes the almost plainchant song of the violin and cello.}}\n\n===III. \"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|The abyss is Time with its sadness, its weariness. The birds are the opposite to Time; they are our desire for light, for stars, for rainbows, and for jubilant songs.}}\nA solo for the clarinet, this movement is a test for even the most accomplished clarinetist, with an extremely slow tempo marking {{nowrap|1=[[quaver]] (eighth note) = [[Tempo#Measuring Tempo|44]]}}.\n\n===IV. \"Interm\u00e8de\"===\nA trio for violin, cello, and clarinet, Messiaen writes of this movement:\n\n{{quote|Scherzo, of a more individual character than the other movements, but linked to them nevertheless by certain [[melodic]] recollections.}}\n\n===V. \"Louange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\"===\nMessiaen writes:\n\n{{quote|Jesus is considered here as the Word.

A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]]. During [[World War I]], he met a [[France|French]] nurse named Noelle. At the time, immigration policies would not allow him to bring her to the United States as a fianc\u00e9e or even as a wife, but he could bring her back as his legal child.  Colonel Wyman therefore adopted her, and brought her back to the Florida panhandle, where he purchased a large amount of land.

A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]].
