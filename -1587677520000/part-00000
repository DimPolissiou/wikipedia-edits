He founded, between 1221 and 1226,  [[Alberbury Priory]] in Shropshire which he granted to the Augustinian canons of [[Lilleshall]] but later transferred to the [[Order of Grandmont]].

Whatever his true place of origin it is however generally believed that the head of the Warin family came to England during the reign of [[William the Conqueror]] (1066\u20131087).

These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Although he won the right to Whittington in or about 1195, he never received formal legal ''[[seisin]]'' and it remained in Welsh hands at the time of his death in 1197.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 35</ref>\n\n[[Whittington Castle]] lies on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which during the Norman era and before was the border between England and [[Wales]]. The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]. In the late 1140s the [[Marcher lord|lordship]] of [[Whittington, Shropshire|Whittington]], like [[Oswestry]] and Overton ceased to be part of England and became part of the [[Kingdom of Powys]] and a Welsh [[marcher lord]]ship.<ref>P.

After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L. Brandin (ed.), ''The History of Fulk Fitz-Warine'' (Alexander Moring Ltd., De La More Press, London 1904), p. xii.</ref> Whittington Castle thereafter descended in the [[Baron FitzWarin|FitzWarin family]], all subsequent holders bearing the first-name Fulk, until the death of [[Fulk XI FitzWarin, 7th Baron FitzWarin]] (1405\u20131420) in 1420.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pps. 51\u201352</ref>\n\nIn 1207 Fulk III was clearly highly regarded by many of the king's barons as evidenced by the identity of men known to have provided surety for Fulk's fine of 1,200 marks to marry the heiress daughter of Robert le Vavasur. The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

These land disputes included estates his father held [[Tenant-in-chief|in-chief]] from the crown and others which he had held from the Peverel family as [[Lord|overlords]].\n\nOther lawsuits concerned Whittington Castle held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen.

The site was fortified as a castle by [[William Peverel]] in 1138, in support of Empress Matilda, the daughter of King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] (1100\u20131135), in her struggle (known as [[The Anarchy]]) for the throne against King Stephen (1135\u20131154), grandson of [[William the Conqueror]].

After his father's death in 1197 Fulk III offered [[feudal relief|relief]] of \u00a3100 for the inheritance of Whittington. However Maurice of Powis (d.1200), the son of Roger of Powis, who had offered half that amount, on 11 April 1200 was granted Whittington by [[John, King of England|King John]]. Again, after Maurice's death in August 1200, King John granted it to Maurice's heirs.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 36</ref>\n\nIt is not known why King John refused to recognise Fulk's claim to Whittington as his rightful inheritance but by April 1201 Fulk was in open rebellion against the King. He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers but was clearly considerable as in the spring of 1201, while King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]], with 100 knights, to counter the rebellion of Fulk and William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 48, 84</ref>\n\nIn July 1202 Fulk and his men are reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\".  Yet another, Eustace de Kivilly, was pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned together with over thirty of his followers, including his brothers William,  Phillip and John and his cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)|William de Braose]] (d.1230), a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him. He is believed then to have been  a vassal of [[Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex|Geoffrey de Mandeville]], Earl of Gloucester.<ref>Sidney Painter, ''The Reign of King John'' (Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press 1964) pp. 280, 294.</ref>\n\nIn 1215 Fulk was one of many giving great trouble to the [[Sheriff of Shropshire]]. Before 1216 and the accession of the infant King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (1216\u20131272), John's son, Fulk's manor of Alveston had been seized by the crown and in the following year 1217 all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218 however Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered restored by the regents of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]].<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 41, 43</ref>\n\nBy 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington. In 1223 however it fell to [[Llywelyn the Great]], prince of Wales. Fulk  regained it the following year although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 42</ref>\n\nBy 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), p. 41</ref>\n\nThroughout these years Fulk's relations with the King were changeable and seemed to be directly dependent on the state of affairs in Wales. As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Janet Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier: The Corbet, Pantulf, and Fitz Warin Families 1066\u20131272'', (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980), pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*Firstly, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

The greatest of his inventions was that of the third system, or [[Genus (music)|genus]], of music, the [[Enharmonic genus|Enharmonic]].\n\nOf the particular tunes (''nomoi'') ascribed to him, the most important was the ''Harmatios nomos'', a mournful and passionate strain, of the rhythm of which we are enabled to form an idea from a passage in the ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' of [[Euripides]], which was set to it, as the passage itself tells us. A dirge, also, in honour of the slain [[Python (mythology)|Python]], was said to have been played by Olympus, at [[Delphi]], on the flute, and in the [[Lydia]]n style. [[Aristophanes]] mentions a mournful strain, set to more flutes than one (''xynaulia'') as well known at Athens under the name of Olympus.<ref>Aristophanes, ''Equit.'' 9</ref> But it can hardly be supposed that his music was all mournful; the [[Nome (Greece)|nome]] in honour of [[Athena]], at least, must have been of a different character. Some ancient writers ascribe to him the ''Nomos Orthios'', which [[Herodotus]] attributes to [[Arion]].\n\nOlympus was a great inventor in [[rhythm]] as well as in music. To the two existing species of rhythm, the ''ison'', in which the ''arsis'' and ''thesis'' are equal (as in the [[Dactyl (poetry)|Dactyl]] and [[Anapaest]]), and the ''diplasion'', in which the ''arsis'' is twice the length of the ''thesis'' (as in the [[Iamb (foot)|Iambus]] and [[Trochee]]), he added a third, the ''hemiolion'' in which the length of the ''arsis'' is equal to two short syllables, and that of the thesis to three, as, in the [[cretic]] foot, the [[paeon (prosody)|paeons]], and the Bacchic foot, though there is some doubt whether the last form was used by Olympus.\n\nThere is no mention of any [[poems]] composed by Olympus.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]]. A cruising yacht is likely to have a [[Head (watercraft)|head]] (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads.

They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam.

More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such [[Marine propulsion|power is inboard]] on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]].

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water\u2014the \"deep vee\" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]].

While a few scenes were produced in 1984, the film's production was canceled when Don Bluth and the film's distributor [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] heard the news of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] beginning work on their [[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|own animated adaptation]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Don Bluth Productions also started production work on an animated feature film entitled ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon#Film adaptations|East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]''.<ref>John Grant, p 35, ''Masters of Animation'',  Special Effects Are Revolutionizing Film\"</ref><ref>John Culhane, \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3DB123BF937A35754C0A964948260&sec=technology&spon=&pagewanted=3 Special Effects Are Revolutionizing Film]\"</ref> Ultimately, the film was never made due to a loss of financial backing,<ref>\"Newswatch: Bluth animation film goes bankrupt\", ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' #98 (May 1985), p. 19.</ref> even though the film was heavily into post-production at the time of its cancellation. Following Don Bluth's partnership with Steven Spielberg, 1986's ''[[An American Tail]]'' was released as Bluth's second film instead. During production of ''East of the Sun and West of the Moon'', Bluth also animated a [[demo reel]] of ''Jawbreaker'', a proposed television series by Phil Mendez of a boy who finds a magical tooth<ref name=\"\u201cJawbreaker\u201d Story\">{{cite web |website=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430124613/http://dragonslairthemovie.com/jawbreaker-story/}}</ref>. The series however, was not greenlit.\n\nAfter acquiring the rights to [[The Beatles]]{{'}} songs in the mid-1980s, [[Michael Jackson]] approached Bluth with a movie idea called ''Strawberry Fields Forever''. The film would have had animated ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''-style vignettes featuring Beatles songs, similar to ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Not only did Don Bluth agree to it, he also planned on making it entirely in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Had the movie been made, it would have predated the ground-breaking 1995 Pixar film ''[[Toy Story]]'' by about eight years. The project fell through when surviving Beatles members denied permission to use their images in the animated film.

The first film was an animated adaptation of ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]'', a story about an abandoned toy rabbit in pursuit of its child owner. The second film was ''Guardian of the Moon'', based on a story by [[Steven Bauer]] about a young boy in a fantasy world who defends the moon and sun from evil forces. Some of the film's concepts were later realised as the 2014 French animated film ''[[Mune: Guardian of the Moon]]''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}.

In 2005, a live-action adaptation of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the live-action film of the same name]] was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]].\n\n===Unproduced Games===\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' in 1983, Don Bluth and [[Cinematronics]] began plans for seven more arcade games; ''\"The Sea Beast\", \"Jason and the Golden Fleece\", \"Devil's Island\", \"Haywire\", \"Drac\", \"Cro Magnon\", and \"Sorceress\"''. Due to the budgeting issues and the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 video game crash]], these projects were abandoned.

He started in 1955 as an assistant to [[John Lounsbery]] for ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]''. In 1957, Bluth left Disney only two years after being hired. Afterward, Bluth spent two and a half years in Argentina on a [[missionary (LDS Church)|mission]] for the [[LDS Church]]. He returned to the United States where he opened the Bluth Brothers Theater with his younger brother [[Toby Bluth|Fred]], though he occasionally worked for Disney.\n\nBluth returned to college and got a degree in English Literature from Brigham Young University. Bluth returned to the animation business and joined [[Filmation]] in 1967, working on layouts for ''[[The Archies]]'' and other projects. He returned full-time to Disney in 1971, where he worked on ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too]]'', and ''[[The Rescuers]]'', and directed animation on ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]''. His last involvement with Disney was the 1978 short ''[[The Small One]]''. Then he made and produced his first own short film, ''[[Banjo the Woodpile Cat]]'', which takes place in his hometown Payson, Utah, during the 1940s as Banjo travels to [[Salt Lake City]] to find the urban world.\n\n==Independent years==\n\n===Early critical success===\nOn his 42nd birthday in 1979, Bluth, along with [[Gary Goldman]], [[John Pomeroy]], and nine fellow Disney animators, set out to start his own [[List of animation studios|animation studio]], [[Don Bluth Productions]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About Don|url=http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|publisher=Don Bluth Animation|accessdate=2012-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826222344/http://donbluthanimation.com/_Don_Bluth_Animation_About_Don.html|archivedate=2012-08-26}}</ref><ref name=\"comicsjournal\">{{cite news|last=Heintjes|first=Tom|title=Newswatch: Bluth animation firm goes bankrupt|url=http://www.tcj.com/archive-viewer-issue-98/?pid=7634|accessdate=2012-07-30|newspaper=The Comics Journal No. 98|page=19|date=May 1985}}</ref> He drew a few (uncredited) scenes for ''[[The Fox and the Hound (film)|The Fox and the Hound]]'' but left early in production.

Following Don Bluth's partnership with Steven Spielberg, 1986's ''[[An American Tail]]'' was released as Bluth's second film instead.\n\nAfter acquiring the rights to [[The Beatles]]{{'}} songs in the mid-1980s, [[Michael Jackson]] approached Bluth with a movie idea called ''Strawberry Fields Forever''. The film would have had animated ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''-style vignettes featuring Beatles songs, similar to ''[[Yellow Submarine (album)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Not only did Don Bluth agree to it, he also planned on making it entirely in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. Had the movie been made, it would have predated the ground-breaking 1995 Pixar film ''[[Toy Story]]'' by about eight years.

The first film was an animated adaptation of ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]'', a story about an abandoned toy rabbit in pursuit of its child owner. The second film was ''Guardian of the Moon'', based on a story by [[Steven Bauer]] about a young boy in a fantasy world who defends the moon and sun from evil forces. Some of the film's concepts were later realised as the 2014 French animated film ''[[Mune: Guardian of the Moon]]''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}. After his partnership with Spielberg ended, Bluth began planning another film titled ''The Little Blue Whale'' with [[Carolco Pictures]]. The planned film was about a little girl and her animal friends who try to protect a little whale from evil whalers.<ref>http://ecollections.scad.edu/iii/cpro/DigitalItemViewPage.external?lang=eng&sp=1000249&sp=T&sp=1&suite=def</ref> The project was abandoned by Carolco after the commercial and critical failure of their first animated film ''[[Pound Puppies and the Legend of Big Paw]]''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nOther unrealised projects also included plans for a 1994 animated short film centered around a magical talking pencil starring [[Dom DeLuise]],<ref>http://ecollections.scad.edu/iii/cpro/DigitalItemViewPage.external?lang=eng&sp=1000076&sp=T&sp=1&suite=def</ref>, animated film adaptations of the books ''[[Deep Wizardry]]'', ''[[Quintaglio Ascension]]'', ''[[The Belgariad]]'', and  ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. The latter productions were cancelled following the box office failure of [[Titan A.E.]] and subsequent closure of [[Fox Animation Studios]]. In 2005, a live-action adaptation of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the live-action film of the same name]] was released by [[Touchstone Pictures]].\n\n===Unproduced Games===\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'' in 1983, Don Bluth and [[Cinematronics]] began plans for seven more arcade games; ''\"The Sea Beast\", \"Jason and the Golden Fleece\", \"Devil's Island\", \"Haywire\", \"Drac\", \"Cro Magnon\", and \"Sorceress\"''. Due to the budgeting issues and the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 video game crash]], these projects were abandoned.
