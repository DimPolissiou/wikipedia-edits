[[Mary Caffrey Low]] became the first female student at Colby, and for two years remained the only one. Eventually she was joined by four other women, and along with [[Elizabeth Gorham Hoag]], [[Ida Fuller]], Hall and [[Louise Helen Coburn]], Low created the [[Sigma Kappa]] sorority at Colby on November 9, 1874.\n\nHall is the only member of Sigma Kappa to also be a member of the [[Order of the Eastern Star]].\n\nBeing the only women in the college, the five of them found themselves together frequently. In 1873\u201374, the five young women decided to form a literary and social society. They were instructed by the college administration that they would need to present a constitution and bylaws with a petition requesting permission to form Sigma Kappa Sorority.\n\nThey began work during that year and on November 9, 1874, the five young women received a letter from the faculty approving their petition. They sought for and received permission to form a sorority with the intent for the organization to become national.\n\nFrances Hall was a high school teacher in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]] prior to entering Colby College. She felt she needed better training for her profession. Hall was slightly older than the other women but was still in her early 20s.\n\nHaving to go to chapel to get a mark, Hall was late one day and had to wait for all the men to come out. It was an embarrassing moment. Hall said afterwards, all she saw was the floor, but all one young man, George Washington Hall, saw was Frances. When his friends asked him what ailed him, he replied, \"I've just seen my wife.\" Frances had to leave college her junior year, as Ida Fuller did also, because of astigmatic headaches.

[[Mary Caffrey Low]] became the first female student at Colby, and for two years remained the only one. Eventually she was joined by four other women, and along with [[Elizabeth Gorham Hoag]], [[Ida Fuller]], Hall and [[Louise Helen Coburn]], Low created the [[Sigma Kappa]] sorority at Colby on November 9, 1874.\n\nHall is the only member of Sigma Kappa to also be a member of the [[Order of the Eastern Star]].\n\nBeing the only women in the college, the five of them found themselves together frequently. In 1873-74, the five young women decided to form a literary and social society. They were instructed by the college administration that they would need to present a constitution and bylaws with a petition requesting permission to form Sigma Kappa Sorority.\n\nThey began work during that year and on November 9, 1874, the five young women received a letter from the faculty approving their petition. They sought for and received permission to form a sorority with the intent for the organization to become national.\n\nFrances Hall was a high school teacher in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]] prior to entering Colby College. She felt she needed better training for her profession. Hall was slightly older than the other women but was still in her early 20s.\n\nHaving to go to chapel to get a mark, Hall was late one day and had to wait for all the men to come out. It was an embarrassing moment. Hall said afterwards, all she saw was the floor, but all one young man, George Washington Hall, saw was Frances. When his friends asked him what ailed him, he replied, \"I've just seen my wife.\" Frances had to leave college her junior year, as Ida Fuller did also, because of astigmatic headaches. She married George, and they went teaching together. Hall was the first Sigma Kappa to be married.\n\nFrances attended the 1928 Convention in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the Saranac Convention in 1933.

These  apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition. During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large [[aphid]]s defend feeding sites on [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]]<!--which species?--> leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources. For example, [[plants]] consume [[nitrogen]] by [[Nitrogen assimilation|absorbing]] it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce [[Nitrogen fixation|soil nitrogen]] to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n \n[[File:Hirschkampf.jpg|thumb|Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition within a species.]]\n\n===Interference===\n\nInterference competition occurs directly between individuals via [[aggression]] etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat.

The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==By taxonomic relationship==\n{{See also|Female intrasexual competition}}\n\nCompetition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as a you are a butt population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nSpecies also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Intraspecific===\n\n{{Main|Intraspecific competition}}\nIntraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same [[Natural resource|resource]]s in an ecosystem.<ref name=\"Townsend2008\">{{Cite book |author1=Townsend, Colin R. |author2=Begon, Michael  | title=Essentials of Ecology | year=2008 | pages=103\u2013105 | isbn=978-1-4051-5658-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific===\n\n{{Main|Interspecific competition}}\nInterspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, communities and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of [[cheetah]]s and [[lion]]s; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs.  Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called '[[intraguild predation]]'.  For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).<ref>.Fedriani, J. M., T. K. Fuller, R. M. Sauvajot and E. C. York. 2000. Competition and intraguild predation among three sympatric carnivores. [[Oecologia]], 125:258-270.</ref>\n\nAn example among protozoa involves ''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' and ''[[Paramecium caudatum]].'' Russian ecologist, [[Georgy Gause]], studied the competition between the two species of ''Paramecium'' that occurred as a result of their coexistence. Through his studies, Gause proposed the [[Competitive exclusion principle]], observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped.<ref>[[Georgy Gause|Gause, G.F.]] (1934). ''The struggle for existence''. Baltimore, MD: Williams & Wilkins.</ref>\n\nCompetition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].<ref name=\"SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates\"/>\n\n== Evolutionary strategies ==\n{{Main|r/K selection theory|Verhulst equation}}\n\nIn evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the [[Natural selection|selection]] of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s which promote success in particular environments.

The word \"niche\" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction. These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper [[habitat]] conditions (like temperature or pH). Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources. If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area. Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist.<ref name=hardin60>{{cite journal |author=Hardin, Garrett |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292\u20131297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717}}</ref><ref name=Pocheville2015>{{cite book | last=Pocheville | first=Arnaud | year=2015 | chapter=The Ecological Niche: History and Recent Controversies | chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/6188833 | editor1-last=Heams | editor1-first=Thomas | editor2-last=Huneman | editor2-first=Philippe | editor3-last=Lecointre | editor3-first=Guillaume |display-editors=3 | editor4-last=Silberstein | editor4-first=Marc | title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences | location=Dordrecht | publisher=Springer | publication-date=2015 | pages=547\u2013586 | isbn=978-94-017-9014-7}}</ref>\n\n== Character displacement ==\n[[File:Geospiza fortis.jpg|thumbnail|left|Medium ground finch ([[Geospiza fortis]]) on Santa Cruz Island in the [[Galapagos Islands|Galapagos]]]]\n{{main article|Character displacement}}\n\nCompetition can cause species to evolve differences in traits. This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition. These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors. Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations. For example, [[Darwin's finches]] can be found alone or together on the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Both species' populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present. However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate sized seeds. Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks. Different finch species can coexist if they have traits\u2014for instance, beak size\u2014that allow them to specialize on particular resources. When ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'' and ''[[Geospiza fuliginosa]]'' are present on the same island, ''G. fuliginosa'' tends to evolve a small beak and ''G. fortis'' a large beak. The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement. For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species. Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.<ref>Brown, W. L., and [[E.

These  apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition. During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large [[aphid]]s defend feeding sites on [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]]<!--which species?--> leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources. For example, [[plants]] consume [[nitrogen]] by [[Nitrogen assimilation|absorbing]] it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce [[Nitrogen fixation|soil nitrogen]] to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n \n[[File:Hirschkampf.jpg|thumb|Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition within a species.]]\n\n===Interference===\n\nInterference competition occurs directly between individuals via [[aggression]] etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat. An example of this can be seen between the ant ''[[Novomessor cockerelli]]'' and [[Pogonomyrmex barbatus|red harvester ants]], where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with small rocks.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Barton, Kasey E. |author2=Sanders, Nathan J. |author3=Gordon, Deborah M. |year=2002 |title=The Effects of Proximity and Colony Age on Interspecific Interference Competition between the Desert Ants ''Pogonomyrmex barbatus'' and ''Aphaenogaster cockerelli'' |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=376\u2013382 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0376:TEOPAC]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>\n\n===Exploitative===\n\nExploitation competition occurs indirectly through a common [[limiting resource]] which acts as an intermediate.

The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==By taxonomic relationship==\n{{See also|Female intrasexual competition}}\n\nCompetition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nSpecies also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Intraspecific===\n\n{{Main|Intraspecific competition}}\nIntraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same [[Natural resource|resource]]s in an ecosystem.<ref name=\"Townsend2008\">{{Cite book |author1=Townsend, Colin R. |author2=Begon, Michael  | title=Essentials of Ecology | year=2008 | pages=103\u2013105 | isbn=978-1-4051-5658-5 }}</ref>\n\n===Interspecific===\n\n{{Main|Interspecific competition}}\nInterspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, communities and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of [[cheetah]]s and [[lion]]s; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs.  Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called '[[intraguild predation]]'.  For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).<ref>.Fedriani, J. M., T. K. Fuller, R. M.

Russian ecologist, [[Georgy Gause]], studied the competition between the two species of ''Paramecium'' that occurred as a result of their coexistence.

''The struggle for existence''. Baltimore, MD: Williams & Wilkins.</ref>\n\nCompetition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups.

On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603.

It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult.

It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.

The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival [[North West Company]] had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\n\nThe Union Jack is the third [[quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] of the 1939 [[coat of arms of Alabama]], which is also used on the flag of the Governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\n\nIn the former International Settlement of [[Kulangsu]] the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag.

In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called ''The Anglo-Saxon Review''. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \"The Anglo Saxon\" with its motto \"Blood is thicker than water\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'<ref>{{cite letter |url=http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/page?contextId=CHAR%2028%2F26%2F11-12#image=0 |last=Churchill |first=Winston |recipient=Jeanette, Lady Randolph Churchill |date=2 March 1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of [[fashion]] since the [[British Invasion]] movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American [[Stars and Stripes flag]] \u2013 compare [[Geri Halliwell]]'s iconic [[Union Jack dress]].

[[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby [[Union of the Crowns|uniting the crowns]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in a [[personal union]], although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white [[saltire]] on a blue background known as the ''Saltire'' or ''St Andrew's Cross'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[Canada]], [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Malta]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Singapore]], [[Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival [[North West Company]] had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\n\nThe Union Jack is the third [[quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] of the 1939 [[coat of arms of Alabama]], which is also used on the flag of the Governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\n\nIn the former International Settlement of [[Kulangsu]] the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag.

In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called ''The Anglo-Saxon Review''. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \"The Anglo Saxon\" with its motto \"Blood is thicker than water\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'<ref>{{cite letter |url=http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/page?contextId=CHAR%2028%2F26%2F11-12#image=0 |last=Churchill |first=Winston |recipient=Jeanette, Lady Randolph Churchill |date=2 March 1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of [[fashion]] since the [[British Invasion]] movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American [[Stars and Stripes flag]] \u2013 compare [[Geri Halliwell]]'s iconic [[Union Jack dress]].

The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts. The importance of Fairbain's work lies in the fact that it was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. Farbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant was suffused with primitive drives that needed to be tamed, but rather that the infant was seeking love  and support that would allow him to develop and explore the world securely, knowing that he was backed up by parents who were ready to help him if he was overwhelmed. As compared to Freud's theory, Fairbairn's model offers a different  theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology and a different approach to  the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model. His model is still classified as a psychoanalytic model as it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models that the fundamental source of human motivation comes  from the unconscious, as well as focusing on the sources of transference, repetition compulsions and resistance. Fairbairn's model  shifted the focus away from Repression of  (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as the fundamental defense mechanism used by humans. Greenberg and Mitchell  noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn's new vision of the human psyche. <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a '''drive/structure  model'''  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices. In contrast,  '''Fairbairn's model''' is a  '''relational/structure mode'''l in that it assumes that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under-developed central ego to tolerate.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and he/she faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are so toxic that they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is '''developed''' (and not a biological inheritance of humankind) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940)'====\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having dissociated memories in their central ego which is defined as '''splits''' in their ego structure. That is,  the conscious ego  does not know about the dissociated memories that are held in the unconscious, thus the central ego has had parts of it split off. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:(1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality...So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>The more frequently that a child encounters intolerable trauma the larger the number of memories of actual lived experience are split off.and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn sees the lack of love in a young child's life as so traumatic and disruptive to his attachment that these parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego.Typically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being loveable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. He continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he is toxic. Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which Freud defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id, because of the preexisting language of psychoanalysis. However Fairbairn took the word and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the models grouped under the heading \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based, central ego in the child. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from them without being sure that his parents love and support him. Their support and encouragement  gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\" That is, he turns away from the harsh world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is clearly a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.  Secondly,  the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumesd were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power and desire for revenge that temporarily lessen his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has come true for millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external people while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. Fairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately in a adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community as he had the temerity to urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Again, this is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to the search for a good object and a relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too relationally destructive for the child's young ego to accept.<blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who has failed the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word repressed rather than dissociated in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event by forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced it with a interpersonal/ relational model  that assumes the rejections of the child needs were dissociated and internalized. Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life. Fairbairn went on to clearly define the source of human psychopathology which was  once again completely at variance with Freud's model. <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories  will form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The next two factors can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might identify with her mother and internalize the role of a victim of abuse. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of his/her childhood and thus have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the event so as to understand what happened to them when they were a defenseless child.       \n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018): \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object\n* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Objec'''t'''\n* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{psychoanalysis}}\n\n'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u025b\u0259r|b|\u025b\u0259r|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 \u2013 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\n[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]\n\nRonald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889\u20131964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.\n\nIn the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].\n\nOn his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience.

The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts. The importance of Fairbain's work lies in the fact that it was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis. Farbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant was suffused with primitive drives that needed to be tamed, but rather that the infant was seeking love  and support that would allow him to develop and explore the world securely, knowing that he was backed up by parents who were ready to help him if he was overwhelmed. As compared to Freud's theory, Fairbairn's model offers a different  theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the dynamics of personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology and a different approach to  the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his ambitious goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model. His model is still classified as a psychoanalytic model as it assumed that the fundamental source of human motivation comes  from the unconscious, and it focuses on the sources of transference, repetition compulsions and resistance. Finally, it shifted away from the  Freudian emphasis on repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as the fundamental defense mechanism used by humans. Greenberg and Mitchell  noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn's new vision of the human psyche. <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a '''drive/structure  model'''  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.      '''Fairbairn's model''' is a  '''relational/structure mode'''l in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under-developed central ego to tolerate.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and he/she faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are so toxic that they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (and not a biological inheritance of humankind) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940)'====\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure, based on many interpersonal events that had to be dissociated. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are:(1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality...So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn sees the lack of love in a young child's life as so traumatic and disruptive to his attachment that these parental failures provoke dissociation, causing splits in his ego.\n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being loveable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. He continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he is toxic. Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which Freud defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id, because of the preexisting language of psychoanalysis. However, he took the word and, in his model, changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or other external objects: \n<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, becomes hopeless and holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies, hopes, and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the models grouped under the heading \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\".\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation) from the parent because of the development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step without being sure that his parents love and support him. Their support and encouragement  gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by turning inwards to his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available. This is clearly a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him. In addition, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumes were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power and desire for revenge that he assumes will lessen his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has come true for millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external people and immersed in their inner fantasy worlds. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. Fairbairn also discusses the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community as he had the temerity to urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Again, this is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to the search for a good object and a relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too relationally destructive for the child's young ego to accept.<blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself here in that he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for help, guidance, love and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word repressed rather than dissociated in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event by forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced it with a interpersonal/ relational model  that assumes the rejections of the child needs were dissociated and internalized. Once in the unconscious,  they resonate throughout the individuals life. Fairbairn went on to clearly define the source of human misery and psychopathology which was  once again completely at variance with Freud's model. <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories  will form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The next two factors can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might identify with her mother and internalize the role of a victim of abuse. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of his/her childhood and thus have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the event so they more fully understand what happened to them when they were a defenseless child.       \n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018): \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object\n* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Objec'''t'''\n* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "David Celani", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWork:I added citations to the \"Work\" section of the page and edited my previously written sections on the 1941 and 1943 papers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn"}
