In particular, any continuously differentiable function is locally Lipschitz, as continuous functions are locally bounded so its gradient is locally bounded as well.\n*A Lipschitz function ''g''&nbsp;:&nbsp;'''R'''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;'''R''' is [[absolutely continuous]] and therefore is differentiable [[almost everywhere]], that is, differentiable at every point outside a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.  Its derivative is [[essentially bounded]] in magnitude by the Lipschitz constant, and for ''a''&nbsp;< ''b'', the difference ''g''(''b'')&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''g''(''a'') is equal to the integral of the derivative ''g''\u2032 on the interval [''a'',&nbsp;''b''].\n**Conversely, if ''f''&nbsp;: ''I''&nbsp;\u2192 '''R''' is absolutely continuous and thus differentiable almost everywhere, and satisfies |''f\u2032''(''x'')|&nbsp;\u2264 ''K'' for almost all ''x'' in ''I'', then ''f'' is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant at most ''K''.\n**More generally, [[Rademacher's theorem]] extends the differentiability result to Lipschitz mappings between Euclidean spaces: a Lipschitz map ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''U''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;'''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>, where ''U'' is an open set in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, is [[almost everywhere]] [[derivative|differentiable]].

If ''f<sub>n</sub>'' converges to a mapping ''f'' [[uniform convergence|uniformly]], then ''f'' is also Lipschitz, with Lipschitz constant bounded by the same ''K''.  In particular, this implies that the set of real-valued functions on a compact metric space with a particular bound for the Lipschitz constant is a closed and convex subset of the [[Banach space]] of continuous functions.  This result does not hold for sequences in which the functions may have ''unbounded'' Lipschitz constants, however.  In fact, the space of all Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space is a subalgebra of the Banach space of continuous functions, and thus dense in it, an elementary consequence of the [[Stone&ndash;Weierstrass theorem]] (or as a consequence of [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], because every polynomial is locally Lipschitz continuous).\n*Every Lipschitz continuous map is [[uniformly continuous]], and hence ''[[a fortiori]]'' [[continuous function|continuous]]. More generally, a set of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant forms an  [[equicontinuous]] set.  The [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]] implies that if {''f<sub>n</sub>''} is a [[uniformly bounded]] sequence of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant, then it has a convergent subsequence.  By the result of the previous paragraph, the limit function is also Lipschitz, with the same bound for the Lipschitz constant.  In particular the set of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space ''X'' having Lipschitz constant \u2264&nbsp;''K''&thinsp; is a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] convex subset of the Banach space ''C''(''X'').\n*For a family of Lipschitz continuous functions ''f''<sub>\u03b1</sub> with common constant, the function <math>\\sup_\\alpha f_\\alpha</math> (and <math>\\inf_\\alpha f_\\alpha</math>) is Lipschitz continuous as well, with the same Lipschitz constant, provided it assumes a finite value at least at a point. \n*If ''U'' is a subset of the metric space ''M'' and ''f''&nbsp;: ''U''&nbsp;\u2192 '''R''' is a Lipschitz continuous function, there always exist Lipschitz continuous maps ''M''&nbsp;\u2192 '''R''' which extend ''f'' and have the same Lipschitz constant as ''f'' (see also [[Kirszbraun theorem]]).

In particular, this implies that the set of real-valued functions on a compact metric space with a particular bound for the Lipschitz constant is a closed and convex subset of the [[Banach space]] of continuous functions.  This result does not hold for sequences in which the functions may have ''unbounded'' Lipschitz constants, however.  In fact, the space of all Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space is a subalgebra of the Banach space of continuous functions, and thus dense in it, an elementary consequence of the [[Stone&ndash;Weierstrass theorem]] (or as a consequence of [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]], because every polynomial is locally Lipschitz continuous).\n*Every Lipschitz continuous map is [[uniformly continuous]], and hence ''[[a fortiori]]'' [[continuous function|continuous]]. More generally, a set of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant forms an  [[equicontinuous]] set.  The [[Arzel\u00e0\u2013Ascoli theorem]] implies that if {''f<sub>n</sub>''} is a [[uniformly bounded]] sequence of functions with bounded Lipschitz constant, then it has a convergent subsequence.  By the result of the previous paragraph, the limit function is also Lipschitz, with the same bound for the Lipschitz constant.  In particular the set of all real-valued Lipschitz functions on a compact metric space ''X'' having Lipschitz constant \u2264&nbsp;''K''&thinsp; is a [[Locally compact space|locally compact]] convex subset of the Banach space ''C''(''X'').\n*For a family of Lipschitz continuous functions ''f''<sub>\u03b1</sub> with common constant, the function <math>\\sup_\\alpha f_\\alpha</math> (and <math>\\inf_\\alpha f_\\alpha</math>) is Lipschitz continuous as well, with the same Lipschitz constant, provided it assumes a finite value at least at a point. \n*If ''U'' is a subset of the metric space ''M'' and ''f''&nbsp;: ''U''&nbsp;\u2192 '''R''' is a Lipschitz continuous function, there always exist Lipschitz continuous maps ''M''&nbsp;\u2192 '''R''' which extend ''f'' and have the same Lipschitz constant as ''f'' (see also [[Kirszbraun theorem]]). An extension is provided by \n::<math>\\tilde f(x):=\\inf_{u\\in U}\\{ f(u)+k\\, d(x,u)\\},</math> \n:where ''k'' is  a Lipschitz constant for ''f'' on ''U''.\n\n==Lipschitz manifolds==\nLet ''U'' and ''V'' be two open sets in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  A function ''T'' : ''U'' \u2192 ''V'' is called '''bi-Lipschitz''' if it is a Lipschitz homeomorphism onto its image, and its inverse is also Lipschitz.\n\nUsing bi-Lipschitz mappings, it is possible to define a Lipschitz structure on a [[topological manifold]], since there is a [[pseudogroup]] structure on bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This structure is intermediate between that of a [[piecewise-linear manifold]] and a [[smooth manifold]]. In fact a PL structure gives rise to a unique Lipschitz structure;<ref>SpringerLink: [http://eom.springer.de/T/t093230.htm Topology of manifolds]</ref> it can in that sense 'nearly' be smoothed.\n\n==One-sided Lipschitz==\nLet F(x) be an [[hemicontinuous|upper semi-continuous]] function of x, and that F(x) is a closed, convex set for all x.

The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother. If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.<ref name = uslib/> Nicotine, medications and alcohol have side effects related to unsafe higher dosages, but neonates may respond differently.

Clinicians will watch the newborn carefully for up to a week after birth for signs of withdrawal, feeding problems, and weight gain. Babies who vomit or who are very dehydrated may need to get fluids through a vein (IV).\n\nSome babies with severe symptoms need medicines such as methadone and morphine to treat withdrawal symptoms.

The goal of treatment is to prescribe the infant a drug similar to the one the mother used during pregnancy and slowly decrease the dose over time. This helps wean the baby off the drug and relieves some withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIf the symptoms are severe, especially if other drugs were used, a second medicine such as phenobarbital or clonidine may be added. Breastfeeding may also be helpful if the mother is in a methadone or buprenorphine treatment program without other drug use.\n\nBabies with this condition often have severe diaper rash or other areas of skin breakdown.

The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother. If the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.<ref name = uslib/> Nicotine, medications and alcohol have side effects related to unsafe higher dosages, but neonates may respond differently.

One difficulty with both is that they were developed to assess opiate withdrawal. The [[Finnegan scoring system]] is more widely used.<ref name = meds+/>\n\n==Prevention==\nNeonatal withdrawal is prevented by the mother abstaining from substance abuse. In some cases, a prescribed medication may have to be discontinued during the pregnancy to prevent addiction by the baby. Early pre-natal care can identify addictive behaviors in the mother and family system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Referrals to treatment centers is appropriate.{{sfn | Henry | page = 184}} Some prescribed medicines should not be stopped without medical supervision, or harm may result.

Clinicians will watch the newborn carefully for up to a week after birth for signs of withdrawal, feeding problems, and weight gain. Babies who vomit or who are very dehydrated may need to get fluids through a vein (IV).\n\nSome babies with severe symptoms need medicines such as methadone and morphine to treat withdrawal symptoms.

The goal of treatment is to prescribe the infant a drug similar to the one the mother used during pregnancy and slowly decrease the dose over time. This helps wean the baby off the drug and relieves some withdrawal symptoms.\n\nIf the symptoms are severe, especially if other drugs were used, a second medicine such as phenobarbital or clonidine may be added. Breastfeeding may also be helpful if the mother is in a methadone or buprenorphine treatment program without other drug use.\n\nBabies with this condition often have severe diaper rash or other areas of skin breakdown.

Starting out as a Bossman at the local Morley's chicken shop under the moniker of Pire\u00e9 Pire\u00e9 (not to be confused with Peri Peri of [[Nando's]]), Reed began to take interest in the darker side of the sound, specialising in sets featuring tracks from the likes of Wookie, [[Zed Bias]], [[El-B]], [[Groove Chronicles]], Steve Gurley and working alongside MC's Tricks & Spellz as part of the \"Fearless Crew\". They held radio slots on South London's inconsistent pirate station \"Desire FM\" before moving to 2GFM before the split of Fearless Crew in 2002. It was then that Reed was to begin using the name Plasticman for future works.<ref>Plastician Interview ''[http://www.factmag.com/2014/05/30/plastician-plasticman-interview]''/</ref>\n\nToward the middle of 2001, Reed had been experimenting with production on [[FL Studio|FruityLoops]]. Being based in Croydon, Reed was part of a close-knit community of young producers attempting to make dark garage tracks that would catch the ear of Big Apple Records resident [[DJ Hatcha]] so that he could support them on his popular pirate radio show.<ref>[http://www.josephjppatterson.co.uk/2013/06/mtv-iggy-plastician-it-feels-like-im.html Text of his MTV interview]</ref> Other young producers in this circle included [[Skream]] and [[Benga (musician)|Benga]], amongst more experienced heads [[Artwork (musician)|Artwork]] / Menta, Benny Ill & [[Horsepower Productions]]. By the end of 2001, although Plasticman's tracks were somewhat overlooked by DJ Hatcha, they were however picked up by East London Grime pioneer, [[DJ Slimzee]]. Slimzee signed Reed's first 12\" release (Venom / Shockwave) to his Slimzos imprint which was released early into 2002.\n\nBy 2003, Reed had been supported by DJ Hatcha on tracks such as Hard Graft, which saw his grimy take on the instrumental sound being welcomed by the FWD contingent, leading to releases on Ammunition Promotions' Soulja, and ROAD imprints, a weekly slot on Rinse FM alongside Mark One (MRK1) & Virus Syndicate, and in the summer saw Reed's first appearance at the world-famous FWD event at Plastic People, London. Soon after, Reed had established himself as a FWD favourite and was announced as one of 4 residents at the club in 2004, alongside Dubstep royalty, DJ Hatcha, Youngsta and Rinse FM owner, DJ Geeneus.<ref>An Oral History of Dubstep''[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/an-oral-history-of-dubstep-vice-lauren-martin-610]''</ref>\n\nIn 2006, Reed was offered a slot on BBC Radio 1's \"The Residency\". This soon turned into \"In New DJ's We Trust\". This was the tipping point for an ongoing legal struggle which forced him to change his name from Plasticman to Plastician.<ref>5 big life moments: Plastician''[https://ukf.com/words/flashback-five-big-moments-life-plastician/8129]''</ref> He spent 18 months on the station before returning to Rinse FM to continue his weekly slot, which he had been continuing under the alias \"Blue Stripe\" during his time at the BBC. He returned to the airwaves on Rinse FM alongside MC Nomad.\n\n2007 saw the release of \"Beg to Differ\", Reed's debut LP and his first release under the Plastician moniker. It received critical acclaim, and contains some of Reed's most recognisable works such as \"Japan\" and \"Intensive Snare\" with North London MC [[Skepta]] of [[Boy Better Know]].<ref>Plastician Interview''[http://rwdmag.com/exclusive-interview-plastician-talks-hometown-nightlife-and-music-career-misconceptions-backstage-at-ibiza-rocks/]''</ref>\n\nPlastician also played a role in putting together the \"Cashmere Agency Presents Mr. Grustle & Tha Russian Dubstep LA Embrace The Renaissance Vol.1 Mixed by Dj Plastician.\" mixtape that was released in June 2009. The tracks were curated by plastician and featured dubstep & hip hop collaborations involving Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and more. Plastician is unique in that he is respected as one of the true pioneers of both the Dubstep and [[Grime (music)|Grime]] genres.\n\n==Terrorhythm Recordings==\nPlastician runs his own record label, Terrorhythm Recordings, formed in 2002. Best known for signing both [[Om Unit]] and [[Joker (musician)|Joker]]'s first releases as well as releasing Plastician's critically acclaimed ''Beg to Differ'' album, it also saw early releases from Macabre Unit, Maniac, Crissy Criss, and Mark One. Moving into more recent times, the label has broadened its sonic palate \u2013 as has Plastician. Terrorhythm currently represents some of the most exciting young musicians associated with today's future beats movement, housing artists such as AWE, GANZ, Louis Futon and Krane among others within its ranks; many of whom have been releasing on the label since their debut releases.<ref>Plastician Interview''[http://www.mtv.co.uk/plastician/videos/mtv-news-at-snowbombing-2013-plastician-interview#!/play/plastician/videos/mtv-news-at-snowbombing-2013-plastician-interview]''</ref> More recently, Plastician has been exploring the experimental trap offshoot, wave music for which his \"Wavepool\" mixes have become recognised as the main reference point for the birth of the genre.<ref>Has Plastician just uncovered a new genre''[http://www.clashmusic.com/news/has-plastician-just-uncovered-a-new-genre]''</ref>\n\n===Terrorhythm Recordings releases===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
