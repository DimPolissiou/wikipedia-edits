The segment AB can be called ''the perpendicular from A to the segment CD'', using \"perpendicular\" as a noun. The point ''B'' is called the ''foot of the perpendicular from ''A'' to segment CD'', or simply, the ''foot of ''A'' on CD''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=114}}</ref> ]]\n{{General geometry |concepts}}\nHi it\u2019s Heza I sell art on Etsy go and buy some\nIn elementary [[geometry]], the property of being '''perpendicular''' ('''perpendicularity''') is the relationship between two [[Line (geometry)|line]]s which meet at a [[right angle]] (90 [[Degree (angle)|degree]]s). The property extends to other related [[Mathematical object|geometric object]]s.\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines [[Intersection|intersect]] at a right angle.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the [[straight angle]] on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[angle]]s. Perpendicularity can be shown to be [[symmetric]], meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order.\n\nPerpendicularity easily extends to [[Line segment|segment]]s and [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s. For example, a line segment <math>\\overline{AB}</math> is perpendicular to a line segment <math>\\overline{CD}</math> if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, <math>\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{CD}</math> means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> For information regarding the perpendicular symbol see [[Up tack]].\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\n\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the [[dihedral angle]] at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees).\n\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of [[orthogonality]]; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.\n\nMore precisely, let {{mvar|A}} be a point and {{mvar|m}} a line. If {{mvar|B}} is the point of intersection of {{mvar|m}} and the unique line through {{mvar|A}} that is perpendicular to {{mvar|m}}, then {{mvar|B}} is called the ''foot'' of this perpendicular through {{mvar|A}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Construction of the perpendicular ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Perpendicular-construction.svg\n| width1 = 236 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Construction of the perpendicular (blue) to the line AB through the point P.\n| image2 = 01-Rechter Winkel mittels Thaleskreis.gif\n| width2 = 254\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Construction of the perpendicular to the half-line h from the point P (applicable not only at the end point A, M is freely selectable), animation at the end with pause 10 s\n| footer = \n}}\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], proceed as follows (see figure left):\n\n* Step 1 (red): construct a [[circle]] with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are [[equidistant]] from P.\n* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B' having equal radius.  Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\n* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.\n\nTo prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.  Then use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SAS congruence theorem]] for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using [[Thales's theorem]], see the animation at right.\n\nThe [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side.

Therefore, in [[Euclidean geometry]], any two lines that are both perpendicular to a third line are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other, because of the [[parallel postulate]].  Conversely, if one line is perpendicular to a second line, it is also perpendicular to any line parallel to that second line.\n\nIn the figure at the right, all of the orange-shaded angles are congruent to each other and all of the green-shaded angles are congruent to each other, because [[Vertical (angles)|vertical angles]] are congruent and alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are congruent.

However, this method cannot be used if the slope is zero or undefined (the line is parallel to an axis).\n\nFor another method, let the two linear functions be: ''a''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub> = 0 and ''a''<sub>2</sub>''x'' + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''y'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub> = 0.

The property extends to other related [[Mathematical object|geometric object]]s.\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to another line if the two lines [[Intersection|intersect]] at a right angle.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> Explicitly, a first line is perpendicular to a second line if (1) the two lines meet; and (2) at the point of intersection the [[straight angle]] on one side of the first line is cut by the second line into two [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[angle]]s. Perpendicularity can be shown to be [[symmetric]], meaning if a first line is perpendicular to a second line, then the second line is also perpendicular to the first. For this reason, we may speak of two lines as being perpendicular (to each other) without specifying an order.\n\nPerpendicularity easily extends to [[Line segment|segment]]s and [[Ray (geometry)|ray]]s. For example, a line segment <math>\\overline{AB}</math> is perpendicular to a line segment <math>\\overline{CD}</math> if, when each is extended in both directions to form an infinite line, these two resulting lines are perpendicular in the sense above. In symbols, <math>\\overline{AB} \\perp \\overline{CD}</math> means line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kay|1969|p=91}}</ref> For information regarding the perpendicular symbol see [[Up tack]].\n\nA line is said to be perpendicular to a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] if it is perpendicular to every line in the plane that it intersects. This definition depends on the definition of perpendicularity between lines.\n\nTwo planes in space are said to be perpendicular if the [[dihedral angle]] at which they meet is a right angle (90 degrees).\n\nPerpendicularity is one particular instance of the more general mathematical concept of [[orthogonality]]; perpendicularity is the orthogonality of classical geometric objects. Thus, in advanced mathematics, the word \"perpendicular\" is sometimes used to describe much more complicated geometric orthogonality conditions, such as that between a surface and its [[Normal (geometry)|normal]].\n\n==Foot of a perpendicular==\nThe word '''foot''' is frequently used in connection with perpendiculars. This usage is exemplified in the top diagram, above, and its caption. The diagram can be in any orientation. The foot is not necessarily at the bottom.\n\nMore precisely, let {{mvar|A}} be a point and {{mvar|m}} a line. If {{mvar|B}} is the point of intersection of {{mvar|m}} and the unique line through {{mvar|A}} that is perpendicular to {{mvar|m}}, then {{mvar|B}} is called the ''foot'' of this perpendicular through {{mvar|A}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Construction of the perpendicular ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Perpendicular-construction.svg\n| width1 = 236 \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Construction of the perpendicular (blue) to the line AB through the point P.\n| image2 = 01-Rechter Winkel mittels Thaleskreis.gif\n| width2 = 254\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 =  Construction of the perpendicular to the half-line h from the point P (applicable not only at the end point A, M is freely selectable), animation at the end with pause 10 s\n| footer = \n}}\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line AB through the point P using [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], proceed as follows (see figure left):\n\n* Step 1 (red): construct a [[circle]] with center at P to create points A' and B' on the line AB, which are [[equidistant]] from P.\n* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at A' and B' having equal radius.  Let Q and P be the points of intersection of these two circles.\n* Step 3 (blue): connect Q and P to construct the desired perpendicular PQ.\n\nTo prove that the PQ is perpendicular to AB, use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SSS congruence theorem]] for ' and QPB' to conclude that angles OPA' and OPB' are equal.  Then use the [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|SAS congruence theorem]] for triangles OPA' and OPB' to conclude that angles POA and POB are equal.\n\nTo make the perpendicular to the line g at or through the point P using [[Thales's theorem]], see the animation at right.\n\nThe [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used as the basis of methods of constructing right angles. For example, by counting links, three pieces of chain can be made with lengths in the ratio 3:4:5. These can be laid out to form a triangle, which will have a right angle opposite its longest side. This method is useful for laying out gardens and fields, where the dimensions are large, and great accuracy is not needed.
