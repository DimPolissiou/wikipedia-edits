Bridge's persona was an unpleasant, gravel-voiced man with an untidy moustache. Sometimes credited as '''Alan Bridge''', and frequently not credited onscreen at all, he appeared in many westerns, especially in the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] series, where he played crooked sheriffs and henchmen.\n\n==Life and career==\nBridge and his sister, who would become the actress Loie Bridge, were raised by their mother and stepfather, a Philadelphia butcher.<ref>1910 U.S. Census, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</ref>  Bridge served in the American infantry during World War I.<ref>U.S. Veterans Administration grave marker, Valhalla Memorial Park, Burbank, California</ref>  Joining relatives in a theatrical troupe, Bridge toured the U.S. as an actor<ref>1920 U.S. Census, Kansas City, Missouri</ref> and wrote a few scripts.

Bridge's persona was an unpleasant, gravel-voiced man with an untidy moustache. Sometimes credited as '''Alan Bridge''', and frequently not credited onscreen at all, he appeared in many westerns, especially in the [[Hopalong Cassidy]] series, where he played crooked sheriffs and henchmen.\n\n==Life and career==\nBridge and his sister, who would become the actress Loie Bridge, were raised by their mother and stepfather, a Philadelphia butcher.<ref>1910 U.S. Census, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</ref>  Bridge served in the American infantry during World War I.<ref>U.S. Veterans Administration grave marker, Valhalla Memorial Park, Burbank, California</ref>  Joining relatives in a theatrical troupe, Bridge toured the U.S. as an actor<ref>1920 U.S. Census, Kansas City, Missouri</ref> and wrote a few scripts.  He broke into movies with a pair of minor screenplays (the comedy short ''Her Hired Husband'' in 1930 and a Western, ''God's Country and the Man''<ref>aka \"A Man's Country\", \"Rose of the Rio Grande\" and \"Trail of the Law\"</ref>  (1931), in which he also appeared. He spent the next 25 years as a familiar face in B-Westerns and mainstream comedies and dramas.  In the forties, Bridge was part of [[Preston Sturges]]' unofficial [[Preston Sturges Unofficial Stock Company Actors|\"stock company\" of character actors]], appearing in ten of the eleven American films that Sturges wrote and directed.<ref>Al Bridge appeared in ''[[Christmas in July (film)|Christmas in July]]'', ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'', ''[[The Palm Beach Story]]'', ''[[The Miracle of Morgan's Creek]]'', ''[[Hail the Conquering Hero]]'', ''[[The Great Moment (1944 film)|The Great Moment]]'', ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'', ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' and ''[[The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Bend]]''.

Tensions between the Earps and [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] had escalated. Ike Clanton had been cited earlier in the day for carrying a weapon in town, after which Tom McLaury had arrived to get Ike. Wyatt Earp and McLaury had a heated exchange. and Wyatt later testified he saw a pistol in Tom's waistband and [[pistol-whipping|buffaloed]] Tom.\n\nLater in the day the Clantons and McLaurys, along with [[Billy Claiborne]], faced off against the Earps and Doc Holiday in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. Some witnesses testified that Frank and Billy Clanton drew their weapons first, while others loyal to the Cowboys supported their version of events in which Tom opened his coat to show he was unarmed. The Earps and Holiday killed Frank and Tom McLaury along with Billy Clanton. All three were buried in Tombstone's [[Boot Hill]] cemetery. Their brother William McLaury spent most of his finances in pursuing charges against the Earps and [[Doc Holliday]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Tom left his pistol at a nearby saloon at some point that afternoon, but the Earps had no way of knowing that.\n\nTom McLaury had $3,000 in his possession when he died during the shootout, a fact that the prosecution emphasized during the preliminary hearing that followed the shoot out. His brother William, who joined the prosecution team, wrote in a letter home to Texas that his brothers had just sold their herd of cattle and were leaving Tombstone shortly to come be with him in Fort Worth. He said that they were in Tombstone on business, with plans to depart shortly afterward to visit him in Texas. They may have been arranging a cattle deal with their neighbor E.

More than a year later, he learned the horse had been seen in Charleston and was in the possession of [[Ike Clanton]] and his brother Billy. Earp and [[Doc Holliday]] rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]], who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to serve an election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton.<ref name=\"behantestimony\">{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/earp/behantestimony.html |title=Testimony of Sheriff John H.

They dug a well and built a substantial [[adobe]] ranch house, a barn, corrals, and irrigation ditches for farming. They owned eight horses, two mules, and 140 cattle. They began planning a visit to their sister Sarah Caroline McLaury in Iowa, who was set to be married on November 30.<ref name=pjohnson>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-will-of-mclaury.htm |title=2014 Six-Shooter Award: The Will of McLaury\n|first =Paul Lee | last=Johnson}}</ref>\n\n== Shootout at the O.K. Corral ==\n[[File:TombstoneGraves.JPG|thumb|right|Graves of [[Billy Clanton]], Frank McLaury and [[Tom McLaury]] in Boothill Cemetery, Tombstone, Arizona.]] On October 26, 1881, the McLaury brothers were in Tombstone to conclude a cattle deal. Tensions between the Earps and [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] had escalated. Ike Clanton had been cited earlier in the day for carrying a weapon in town, after which Tom McLaury had arrived to get Ike. Wyatt Earp and McLaury had a heated exchange. and Wyatt later testified he saw a pistol in Tom's waistband and [[pistol-whipping|buffaloed]] Tom.\n\nLater in the day the Clantons and McLaurys, along with [[Billy Claiborne]], faced off against the Earps and Doc Holiday in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. Some witnesses testified that Frank and Billy Clanton drew their weapons first, while others loyal to the Cowboys supported their version of events in which Tom opened his coat to show he was unarmed. The Earps and Holiday killed Frank and Tom McLaury along with Billy Clanton. All three were buried in Tombstone's [[Boot Hill]] cemetery. Their brother William McLaury spent most of his finances in pursuing charges against the Earps and [[Doc Holliday]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Tom left his pistol at a nearby saloon at some point that afternoon, but the Earps had no way of knowing that.\n\nTom McLaury had $3,000 in his possession when he died during the shootout, a fact that the prosecution emphasized during the preliminary hearing that followed the shoot out. His brother William, who joined the prosecution team, wrote in a letter home to Texas that his brothers had just sold their herd of cattle and were leaving Tombstone shortly to come be with him in Fort Worth. He said that they were in Tombstone on business, with plans to depart shortly afterward to visit him in Texas. They may have been arranging a cattle deal with their neighbor E. B Frink with butchers Bauer & Kehoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.ionsgroupng.com/w/Frank_McLaury|title=Frank McLaury|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough modern historians have called him a [[gunfighter]], others say he was not. The Gunfight at the O.K.

The full name on his birth certificate is Edward Joel Stone Pawley; he never used the Stone name, which derived from a Stone family in Illinois.\n\n== Early years ==\nAt maturity, Pawley was 5'10\" tall with thick black hair and blue eyes. While in high school, he became interested in both journalism and acting. Acting won out after taking drama classes and appearing in high school plays. He moved to New York City in 1920 to pursue a career in the theater.\n\n==Broadway==\nPawley began his [[theatre|theatrical]] career in 1920 and reached the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage in 1923 in ''[[The Shame Woman]]''. He went on to star in various well-known Broadway plays, including ''[[Elmer Gantry (play)|Elmer Gantry]]'' (1928), ''[[Processional (film)|Processional]]'' (1928), ''[[Subway Express]]'' (1929), ''[[Two Seconds]]'' (1931), ''[[Life Begins (film)|Life Begins]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Willow and I]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |title=Edward Pawley |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/edward-pawley-55757 |website=Internet Broadway Database |publisher=The Broadway League |accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref> Pawley's rich, baritone voice was hailed by leading journalists of the day, including [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Heywood Hale Broun]]. Although he was probably best known in the theater for his portrayal of [[Elmer Gantry]] in the Broadway play of the same name, it was his portrayal of John Allen in ''[[Two Seconds]]'' that brought him to the attention of Hollywood by way of [[Warner Brothers]]. Winchell wrote that Pawley received a standing ovation after his opening night performance in the 1931 play ''[[Two Seconds]]''.\n\n==Hollywood==\nNot long after [[sound film]] came into vogue, Pawley left the theater in 1932 and went to [[Hollywood]] where he performed in over 50 movies during a relatively brief (for Hollywood) ten-year span. He had feature roles in such movies as ''The Hoosier Schoolboy''<ref>{{cite news |title=Strand: Stage His Love |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/40148601/edward_pawley/ |accessdate=December 5, 2019 |work=Kingsport Times |date=February 26, 1939 |location=Tennessee, Kingsport |page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> with [[Mickey Rooney]], ''[[G Men]]'' with [[James Cagney]], ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]'' with Cagney and [[Humphrey Bogart]], ''[[King Solomon of Broadway]]'' with [[Edmund Lowe]] and Louise Henry, ''[[Each Dawn I Die]]'' with [[George Raft]] and Cagney, ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'' with [[Janet Waldo]] and [[Donald O'Connor]]  and ''[[Romance on the Range (film)|Romance on the Range]]'' with [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gabby Hayes]]. He played mostly \"bad guy\" roles in [[gangster]], [[Horror film|horror]], [[comedy]] and [[Western films]]. He became friends with Cagney (with whom he made five movies), [[Jackie Cooper]] (four movies) and [[Francis Lederer]].  One of his earliest friends in the entertainment industry was [[Arthur Hughes (actor)|Arthur Hughes]], who played Bill Davidson on the long-running radio show ''[[Just Plain Bill]]''. Hughes also acted in some Broadway plays and was Pawley's best man at his wedding in 1922 to stage actress Martina May Martin.\n\n==Radio==\nPawley became disenchanted with Hollywood during the attempted infiltration by the [[communists]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s and left in 1942. He returned briefly to Broadway, where he starred with Gregory Peck in what was Peck's second Broadway play titled ''[[The Willow and I]]''. In the 1930s, Pawley had performed leading romantic roles on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' radio program. He resumed work in radio after returning to New York City. He played opposite [[Lucille Wall]] in the radio soap opera ''[[Portia Faces Life]]'' as \"Love Story Boy and Girl.\"{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}} Later in 1943, Pawley played Steve Wilson on the radio drama series ''[[Big Town]]'',<ref name=\"rp\">{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows|date=1999|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-4513-4|pages=40-41}}</ref>, replacing [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had played the role from 1937\u201342 when the show was produced in Hollywood. Wilson's sidekick on ''Big Town'' was \"girl reporter\" Lorelei Kilbourne, played by [[Fran Carlon]].  Pawley had performed with Robinson in 1926 in a comedy play titled \"[[The Stolen Lady]]\" at \"[[Werba's Brooklyn Theater]]\".\n\nDuring Pawley's eight-year reign, ''Big Town'' achieved the number one rating for reporter-type radio drama shows. In the January 1948 Nielson ratings, the show was ranked #12 among all radio programs, ahead of such popular shows as ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Sam Spade|Sam Spade]]'', ''[[Mr. District Attorney]]'', ''[[The FBI in Peace and War]]'', ''[[Blondie (radio)|Blondie]]'' and ''[[Mr. and Mrs. North]]''.  It also was in the Top 10 of all radio shows more times than any other that year except for [[The Bob Hope Show]] and [[Fibber McGee and Molly]].  His audience was estimated anywhere from 10-20 million listeners.\n\n==Retirement==\nPawley left ''Big Town'' in 1951 and retired near the small village of [[Amissville, Virginia|Amissville]] in rural [[Rappahannock County, Virginia]]. He had fallen in love with the state while touring with the 1920 play ''[[East Is West]]'', his first professional acting role. Pawley would become the quintessential \"Virginia gentleman\" and was loved for his [[integrity]], [[patriotism]] and charm. He was admired for his vocabulary and speaking voice, as well as his status as an entertainer in three different media forms (theater, film, and radio). He raised and sold championship goats, wrote poetry and was a part-time announcer at local radio station [[WCVA (AM)|WCVA]] in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].  At WCVA, he replaced (Robert Gibson Corder, Ph.D.), who would later write Pawley's biography.

He and his second wife had no children, but in his will named Jane, Ross, Kathyrn, Juia, Richard and Robin Rottier as his spiritual children. Both he and his wife, who died in 1984, were cremated and their ashes scattered at their favorite spot, \"Roaring Rock\", alongside the Rush River, which partially flows through their former estate in Rock Mills.

The full name on his birth certificate is Edward Joel Stone Pawley; he never used the Stone name, which derived from a Stone family in Illinois.\n\n== Early years ==\nAt maturity, Pawley was 5'10\" tall with thick black hair and blue eyes. While in high school, he became interested in both journalism and acting. Acting won out after taking drama classes and appearing in high school plays. He moved to New York City in 1920 to pursue a career in the theater.\n\n==Broadway==\nPawley began his [[theatre|theatrical]] career in 1920 and reached the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage in 1923 in ''[[The Shame Woman]]''. He went on to star in various well-known Broadway plays, including ''[[Elmer Gantry (play)|Elmer Gantry]]'' (1928), ''[[Processional (film)|Processional]]'' (1928), ''[[Subway Express]]'' (1929), ''[[Two Seconds]]'' (1931), ''[[Life Begins (film)|Life Begins]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Willow and I]]'' (1942).<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |title=Edward Pawley |url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/edward-pawley-55757 |website=Internet Broadway Database |publisher=The Broadway League |accessdate=October 22, 2019}}</ref> Pawley's rich, baritone voice was hailed by leading journalists of the day, including [[Walter Winchell]] and [[Heywood Hale Broun]]. Although he was probably best known in the theater for his portrayal of [[Elmer Gantry]] in the Broadway play of the same name, it was his portrayal of John Allen in ''[[Two Seconds]]'' that brought him to the attention of Hollywood by way of [[Warner Brothers]]. Winchell wrote that Pawley received a standing ovation after his opening night performance in the 1931 play ''[[Two Seconds]]''.\n\n==Hollywood==\nNot long after [[sound film]] came into vogue, Pawley left the theater in 1932 and went to [[Hollywood]] where he performed in over 50 movies during a relatively brief (for Hollywood) ten-year span. He had feature roles in such movies as ''The Hoosier Schoolboy''<ref>{{cite news |title=Strand: Stage His Love |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/40148601/edward_pawley/ |accessdate=December 5, 2019 |work=Kingsport Times |date=February 26, 1939 |location=Tennessee, Kingsport |page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> with [[Mickey Rooney]], ''[[G Men]]'' with [[James Cagney]], ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]'' with Cagney and [[Humphrey Bogart]], ''[[King Solomon of Broadway]]'' with [[Edmund Lowe]] and Louise Henry, ''[[Each Dawn I Die]]'' with [[George Raft]] and Cagney, ''[[Tom Sawyer, Detective]]'' with [[Janet Waldo]] and [[Donald O'Connor]]  and ''[[Romance on the Range (film)|Romance on the Range]]'' with [[Roy Rogers]] and [[Gabby Hayes]]. He played mostly \"bad guy\" roles in [[gangster]], [[Horror film|horror]], [[comedy]] and [[Western films]]. He became friends with Cagney (with whom he made five movies), [[Jackie Cooper]] (four movies) and [[Francis Lederer]].  One of his earliest friends in the entertainment industry was [[Arthur Hughes (actor)|Arthur Hughes]], who played Bill Davidson on the long-running radio show ''[[Just Plain Bill]]''. Hughes also acted in some Broadway plays and was Pawley's best man at his wedding in 1922 to stage actress Martina May Martin.\n\n==Radio==\nPawley became disenchanted with Hollywood during the attempted infiltration by the [[communists]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s and left in 1942. He returned briefly to Broadway, where he starred with Gregory Peck in what was Peck's second Broadway play titled ''[[The Willow and I]]''. In the 1930s, Pawley had performed leading romantic roles on ''[[The Collier Hour]]'' radio program. He resumed work in radio after returning to New York City. He played opposite [[Lucille Wall]] in the radio soap opera ''[[Portia Faces Life]]'' as \"Love Story Boy and Girl.\"{{Citation needed |date=October 2019}} Later in 1943, Pawley played Steve Wilson on the radio drama series ''[[Big Town]]'',<ref name=\"rp\">{{cite book|last1=Terrace|first1=Vincent|title=Radio Programs, 1924-1984: A Catalog of More Than 1800 Shows|date=1999|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7864-4513-4|pages=40-41}}</ref>, replacing [[Edward G. Robinson]], who had played the role from 1937\u201342 when the show was produced in Hollywood. Wilson's sidekick on ''Big Town'' was \"girl reporter\" Lorelei Kilbourne, played by [[Fran Carlon]].  Pawley had performed with Robinson in 1926 in a comedy play titled \"[[The Stolen Lady]]\" at \"[[Werba's Brooklyn Theater]]\".\n\nDuring Pawley's eight-year reign, ''Big Town'' achieved the number one rating for reporter-type radio drama shows. In the January 1948 Nielson ratings, the show was ranked #12 among all radio programs, ahead of such popular shows as ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Sam Spade|Sam Spade]]'', ''[[Mr. District Attorney]]'', ''[[The FBI in Peace and War]]'', ''[[Blondie (radio)|Blondie]]'' and ''[[Mr. and Mrs. North]]''.  It also was in the Top 10 of all radio shows more times than any other that year except for [[The Bob Hope Show]] and [[Fibber McGee and Molly]].  His audience was estimated anywhere from 10-20 million listeners.\n\n==Retirement==\nPawley left ''Big Town'' in 1951 and retired near the small village of [[Amissville, Virginia|Amissville]] in rural [[Rappahannock County, Virginia]]. He had fallen in love with the state while touring with the 1920 play ''[[East Is West]]'', his first professional acting role. Pawley would become the quintessential \"Virginia gentleman\" and was loved for his [[integrity]], [[patriotism]] and charm. He was admired for his vocabulary and speaking voice, as well as his status as an entertainer in three different media forms (theater, film, and radio). He raised and sold championship goats, wrote poetry and was a part-time announcer at local radio station [[WCVA (AM)|WCVA]] in [[Culpeper, Virginia]].  At WCVA, he replaced (Robert Gibson Corder, Ph.D.), who would later write Pawley's biography.

Corral}}\n'''Joseph Isaac Clanton''' (1847 \u2013 June 1, 1887) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|The Cowboys]] who clashed with lawmen [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp]] as well as [[Doc Holliday]]. On October 26, 1881, Clanton was present at the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] in the [[boomtown]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight, in which his 19-year-old brother, [[Billy Clanton|Billy]], was killed.\n\nClanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing, Justice [[Wells Spicer]] ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty. Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released. Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for [[cattle raiding|cattle-rustling]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{details|topic=his early life|Newman Haynes Clanton}}\n\nBorn in [[Callaway County, Missouri]], Joseph Isaac \"Ike\" Clanton was one of seven children of [[Newman Haynes Clanton]], (1816\u20131881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in [[Arizona Territory]].\n\nClanton's mother died in 1866. Ike stayed with the family when they moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone, Arizona Territory]], about 1877 (before Tombstone became a town or even a mining center). At that time, Newman Clanton was living with his sons [[Phineas Clanton|Phin]] (or \"Fin\"), Ike, and Billy. By 1878 Ike was running a small \"lunch counter\" at the Tombstone Mill site (now Millville on the San Pedro River\u2014not in modern Tombstone). By 1881, however, he was working on his father's ranch at Lewis Springs, about {{convert|12|mi}} west of Tombstone and {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]].<ref>Traywick, B., Wyatt Earp's 13 Dead Men, pg. 15</ref>\n\nThe Clantons and their ranch hands and associates were known as the \"[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]\", and they had a reputation for reckless behavior. They were accused of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]], as well as other acts of banditry and murder.\n\n== Notoriety, clashes with the Earp lawmen ==\n\nClanton's notoriety is based largely on his conflict with [[Wyatt Earp]] and Wyatt's friend [[Doc Holliday]]. The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881. The Cowboys supported incumbent Sheriff Charles Shibell while the Earps supported his opponent Bob Paul in the November 1880 election. Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known for talking too much.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, Earp had a horse stolen. More than a year later, probably sometime in December 1880, Earp was told the horse was being used near Charleston, and Wyatt and Holliday were forced to ride to the Clanton's ranch near Charleston to await ownership papers in order to legally recover it. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \"lose,\" but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy Clanton knew to whom the horse belonged. Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] later testified that the incident had angered Ike Clanton. It also angered Earp.\n\n===Earp offers Clanton reward money===\n\nAfter he was passed over by [[Johnny Behan]] for the position of [[undersheriff]], Earp thought he might beat him in the next [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] election. He thought catching the March 15, 1881 robbers of the Benson Stage (in which the driver and a passenger were killed) would help him win the sheriff's office. Earp later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the [[Wells Fargo|Wells, Fargo & Co.]] reward money and more to Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Earp, the plan was foiled when the three suspects, Leonard, Head and Crane, were killed in unrelated incidents.<ref name=\"historynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005161307/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|archivedate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1881, Clanton got into an argument with gambler \"Denny\" McCann. On the morning of June 9, 1881, they were drinking in an Allen Street [[Western saloon|saloon]] when Clanton insulted McCann. McCann slapped Clanton, who left and fetched his pistol. McCann did the same and the two met on the street in front of the Wells Fargo office. They had already drawn their weapons when Tombstone Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] stepped between them, preventing a shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html|title=Tombstone, Arizona - Historical Accounts|publisher=Legends of America|accessdate=27 May 2011|date=June 6, 1881|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123171022/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html|archivedate=23 November 2011}} Quoted from the June 6, 1881 edition of ''The Tombstone Epitaph''</ref>\n\n==Clanton rustling and ranching==\n\nThe Clanton Ranch grew into a successful enterprise.

On October 25, 1881, while Clanton was in Tombstone, drunk and very loud, Holliday accused him of lying about the Benson stagecoach robbery. Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp intervened and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing, and Holliday went home.\n\nAfter the confrontation with Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his boarding house at Camillus Sidney \"Buck\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] [[Marshal]] Virgil Earp played cards with Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise [[County Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] and a fifth man (unknown to Clanton and to history), until morning.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/>\n\nAt about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed. Clanton testified later that he saw Virgil take his [[six-shooter]] out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Not having rented a room, McLaury and Clanton had no place to go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been drinking all night, in front of the telegraph office. Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Clanton insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Clanton was armed and covered his gun for him, recalling that Clanton told him \"'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open\u2014that they would have to fight' ...

At about 1:00 pm, Virgil and Morgan Earp surprised Clanton on 4th Street where Virgil [[pistol whip]]ped him from behind.

Both Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone.

Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton were killed.\n\n== Files murder charges against Earps ==\n\nAfter the gunfight in Tombstone, during which the McLaury brothers and Billy Clanton were killed, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. They were arrested and released on bail. During a month-long preliminary hearing before Judge [[Wells Spicer]], Clanton told a story of abuse that he had suffered at the hands of the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed. Clanton said Wyatt shoved his revolver in his belly, telling him, \"You son-of-a-bitch, you can have a fight!\".<ref name=\"iketestimony\" />\n\nClanton backed up Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]]'s testimony that Holliday and Morgan Earp had fired the first two shots and that the next several shots also came from the Earp party.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Under [[cross-examination]], Clanton told a story of the lead-up to the gunfight that did not make sense. He said the Benson stage robbery was concocted by the Earps and Holliday to cover up money they had \"piped off\" to pay bribes.

Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Murder was a [[capital offense]], and given their relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton.

Corral}}\n'''Joseph Isaac Clanton''' (1847 \u2013 June 1, 1887) was a member of a loose association of outlaws known as [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|The Cowboys]] who clashed with lawmen [[Wyatt Earp|Wyatt]], [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]] and [[Morgan Earp]] as well as [[Doc Holliday]]. On October 26, 1881, Clanton was present at the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] in the [[boomtown]] of [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]], [[Arizona Territory]] but was unarmed and ran from the gunfight, in which his 19-year-old brother, [[Billy Clanton|Billy]], was killed.\n\nClanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday but after a 30-day preliminary hearing, Justice [[Wells Spicer]] ruled that the lawmen had acted within their lawful duty. Clanton was implicated in the attempted assassination of Virgil Earp on December 30, 1881 but other Cowboys provided an alibi and he was released. Six years later Clanton was killed attempting to flee when he was shot by a lawman seeking to arrest him for [[cattle raiding|cattle-rustling]].\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{details|topic=his early life|Newman Haynes Clanton}}\n\nBorn in [[Callaway County, Missouri]], Joseph Isaac \"Ike\" Clanton was one of seven children of [[Newman Haynes Clanton]], (1816\u20131881) and his wife Mariah Sexton (Kelso) Clanton. His father worked at times as a day laborer, a gold miner, a farmer, and by the late 1870s, a cattleman in [[Arizona Territory]].\n\nClanton's mother died in 1866. Ike stayed with the family when they moved to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone, Arizona Territory]], about 1877 (before Tombstone became a town or even a mining center). At that time, Newman Clanton was living with his sons [[Phineas Clanton|Phin]] (or \"Fin\"), Ike, and Billy. By 1878 Ike was running a small \"lunch counter\" at the Tombstone Mill site (now Millville on the San Pedro River\u2014not in modern Tombstone). By 1881, however, he was working on his father's ranch at Lewis Springs, about {{convert|12|mi}} west of Tombstone and {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]].<ref>Traywick, B., Wyatt Earp's 13 Dead Men, pg. 15</ref>\n\nThe Clantons and their ranch hands and associates were known as the \"[[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]\", and they had a reputation for reckless behavior. They were accused of [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] from across the [[Mexico\u2013United States border|U.S.\u2013Mexico border]], as well as other acts of banditry and murder.\n\n== Notoriety, clashes with the Earp lawmen ==\n\nClanton's notoriety is based largely on his conflict with [[Wyatt Earp]] and Wyatt's friend [[Doc Holliday]]. The Earps and the Clantons had political, personal, and legal differences and the animosity between them grew throughout 1881. The Cowboys supported incumbent Sheriff Charles Shibell while the Earps supported his opponent Bob Paul in the November 1880 election. Clanton repeatedly boasted in public, drank heavily, and had a quick temper. He was well known for talking too much.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nIn November 1879, shortly after arriving in Tombstone, Earp had a horse stolen. More than a year later, probably sometime in December 1880, Earp was told the horse was being used near Charleston, and Wyatt and Holliday were forced to ride to the Clanton's ranch near Charleston to await ownership papers in order to legally recover it. According to Wyatt's testimony later, 18-year-old Billy Clanton asked him insolently if he had any more horses to \"lose,\" but he gave the horse up without first being shown the ownership papers, demonstrating to Wyatt that Billy Clanton knew to whom the horse belonged. Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] later testified that the incident had angered Ike Clanton. It also angered Earp.\n\n===Earp offers Clanton reward money===\n\nAfter he was passed over by [[Johnny Behan]] for the position of [[undersheriff]], Earp thought he might beat him in the next [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise County]] election. He thought catching the March 15, 1881 robbers of the Benson Stage (in which the driver and a passenger were killed) would help him win the sheriff's office. Earp later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the [[Wells Fargo|Wells, Fargo & Co.]] reward money and more to Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Earp, the plan was foiled when the three suspects, Leonard, Head and Crane, were killed in unrelated incidents.<ref name=\"historynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005161307/http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|archivedate=October 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1881, Clanton got into an argument with gambler \"Denny\" McCann. On the morning of June 9, 1881, they were drinking in an Allen Street [[Western saloon|saloon]] when Clanton insulted McCann. McCann slapped Clanton, who left and fetched his pistol. McCann did the same and the two met on the street in front of the Wells Fargo office. They had already drawn their weapons when Tombstone Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] stepped between them, preventing a shooting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html|title=Tombstone, Arizona - Historical Accounts|publisher=Legends of America|accessdate=27 May 2011|date=June 6, 1881|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123171022/http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-tombstonehistoricaltext3.html|archivedate=23 November 2011}} Quoted from the June 6, 1881 edition of ''The Tombstone Epitaph''</ref>\n\n==Clanton rustling and ranching==\n\nThe Clanton Ranch grew into a successful enterprise.

On October 25, 1881, while Clanton was in Tombstone, drunk and very loud, Holliday accused him of lying about the Benson stagecoach robbery. Tombstone City Marshal Virgil Earp intervened and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing, and Holliday went home.\n\nAfter the confrontation with Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his boarding house at Camillus Sidney \"Buck\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] [[Marshal]] Virgil Earp played cards with Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise [[County Sheriff]] [[Johnny Behan]] and a fifth man (unknown to Clanton and to history), until morning.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/>\n\nAt about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed.

Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been drinking all night, in front of the telegraph office.

He further claimed that Holliday had told him that Holliday had \"piped off\" money from the stage before it left (although no money was missing, and the stage had not been successfully robbed). Clanton also said Holliday had confessed to him about killing the stage driver.<ref name=\"iketestimony\"/> Murder was a [[capital offense]], and given their relationship, it was unlikely Holliday would confide in Clanton. Clanton testified that Earp had threatened to kill his confederates because he feared they would reveal his part in the robbery.

On the morning of the shooting Virgil Earp had arrested him for carrying a revolver. At the gunfight, he was unarmed. Spicer noted that Clanton had claimed the Earps were out to murder him, yet on both occasions that day the Earps had not killed him, and allowed him to escape unchallenged during the fight.

Both Brighton and Miller ordered him to halt but instead of doing so, when about twenty yards distant where the trail took a turn to the left, he threw his rifle over his left arm attempting to fire; at this instance Detective Brighton fired, the ball entering under the left arm and passing directly through the heart and out under the right arm. Ike reeled in his saddle and fell on the right side of his horse, his rifle falling on the left.\n\nBefore the fall, Brighton fired a second shot which passed through the cantle of the saddle and grazed Ike's right leg.  When Brighton and Miller walked up to where Ike lay they found he was dead.

{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== #WhoMadeMyClothes ==\nThe #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag was launched in 2013 by [[Fashion Revolution]] co-founders, Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blanchard|first=Tamsin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/commentisfree/2019/apr/22/who-made-my-clothes-stand-up-for-workers-rights-with-fashion-revolution-week|title=Who Made My Clothes?

To promote the hashtag in 2015, [[Fashion Revolution]] released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, [[Fashion Revolution]] has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] - international alliance of labor unions and non-governmental organizations\n* [[Coalition qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contre les ateliers de mis\u00e8re]] - a Qu\u00e9bec anti-sweatshop coalition based in Montr\u00e9al\n* [[Free the Children]] - a Canadian organization that helps raise awareness and put a stop to Child Labour \u2013 Also helps other children in need\n* [[Global Exchange]] - an international human rights organization founded in 1988 dedicated to promoting social, economic and environmental justice\n* [[Green America]] - membership organization based in the United States\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] - founded to combat sweatshop labor and US government policy in El Salvador and Central America\n* [[International Labor Rights Forum]]\n* [[International Labour Organization]] - a specialized agency of the United Nations\n* [[Maquila Solidarity Network]] - a Canadian anti-sweatshop network\n* [[Rugmark]] - a carpet labeling program and rehabilitation centers for former child laborers in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n* [[SweatFree Communities]] - a nationwide network for local action against sweatshops\n* SweatsHope - an Australian/New Zealand organization to create a sweatshop free world and stop human trafficking\n* [[UNITE HERE]] - a labor union based in the United States and Canada dedicated to achieving higher standards for laborers \n* [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] - a student organization in the United States and Canada\n* [[Worker Rights Consortium]] - a labor rights organization focused on protecting the rights of workers who make apparel in the United States\n\n=== In Asia ===\n* [[Asia Monitor Resource Center]] - focuses on promoting democratic labor movements in Asia and the Pacific\n* [[China Labour Bulletin]] - reports on labor concerns in China\n* [[Chinese Working Women Network]] - supports and empowers Chinese migrant working women\n* [[Globalization Monitor]] - non-profit based in Hong Kong that promotes awareness on negative effects of globalization\n* [[Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee]] - empowers workers, acts as a policy watch-dog, and promotes independent trade union movements\n* [[No Sweat Shop Label and Homeworkers Code of Practice]] - corporate code of conduct to eliminate sweatshop conditions in Australia\n* [[Thai Labour Campaign]] - covers labor disputes, worker rights campaigns and labor law in Thailand\n* [[Transnationals Information Exchange]] - information on garment worker struggles in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n==Prominent campaigners==\n* [[Lady Astor]]\n* [[Alfred Deakin]]\n* [[Alfred George Gardiner]]\n* [[Vida Goldstein]]\n* [[Florence Kelley]]\n* [[Charles Kernaghan]]\n* [[Mary Reid Macarthur]]\n* [[Samuel Mauger]]\n* [[R.

The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015. The show raises an awareness on the current issue of sweatshops in the clothing industry through advocacy from famous people in the fashion industry such as fashion bloggers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Child labour]]\n* [[Craftivism#Anti-sweatshop]]\n* [[Nicholas D.

It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== #WhoMadeMyClothes ==\nThe #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag was launched in 2013 by [[Fashion Revolution]] co-founders, Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blanchard|first=Tamsin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/commentisfree/2019/apr/22/who-made-my-clothes-stand-up-for-workers-rights-with-fashion-revolution-week|title=Who Made My Clothes?

By 2018, the hashtag received 99.6 million impressions on Twitter and 170,000 posts were shared on Twitter and Instagram containing at least one of [[Fashion Revolution]]'s hashtags.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviapinnock/2018/05/04/the-best-answers-to-whomademyclothes-this-fashion-revolution-week/|title=The Best Answers To #WhoMadeMyClothes This Fashion Revolution Week|last=Pinnock|first=Olivia|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The goal of the hashtag was to bring awareness to consumers about the brands that they purchase from and raise awareness for\n\nthe humanitarian and ethical issues in fast fashion. Garment workers in factories responded to the movement by participating with the hashtag #IMadeYourClothes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe movement began in [[England]] and spread through social media. On Twitter, 31.82% of the tweets with #WhoMadeMyClothes were posted by users from the United Kingdom. The top 5 countries with the highest search activity and Twitter posts for #WhoMadeMyClothes were the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, and France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=D|first=Karthick.|last2=Vadivu|first2=Dr. G.|date=2017-08-31|title=Seismic: A Self-Exciting Point Process Model for Predicting Tweet Popularity using Hashtags|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.31142/ijtsrd2366|journal=International Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development|volume=Volume-1|issue=Issue-5|pages=796\u2013802|doi=10.31142/ijtsrd2366|issn=2456-6470}}</ref> Celebrities including Emma Watson, Kelly Slater, and Fernanda Paes Leme used the hashtag on Twitter to support the issue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fashionrevolution.org/2018-impact/|title=2018 Impact|website=Fashion Revolution|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe movement also utilized YouTube to spread awareness. To promote the hashtag in 2015, [[Fashion Revolution]] released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, [[Fashion Revolution]] has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view. An economist pointed out \u201cas simple as this: \u2018Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don\u2019t,\u2019 as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate.\u201d{{clarify|date=April 2020}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93\u2013122}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\n* [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] - international alliance of labor unions and non-governmental organizations\n* [[Coalition qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise contre les ateliers de mis\u00e8re]] - a Qu\u00e9bec anti-sweatshop coalition based in Montr\u00e9al\n* [[Free the Children]] - a Canadian organization that helps raise awareness and put a stop to Child Labour \u2013 Also helps other children in need\n* [[Global Exchange]] - an international human rights organization founded in 1988 dedicated to promoting social, economic and environmental justice\n* [[Green America]] - membership organization based in the United States\n* [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] - founded to combat sweatshop labor and US government policy in El Salvador and Central America\n* [[International Labor Rights Forum]]\n* [[International Labour Organization]] - a specialized agency of the United Nations\n* [[Maquila Solidarity Network]] - a Canadian anti-sweatshop network\n* [[Rugmark]] - a carpet labeling program and rehabilitation centers for former child laborers in India, Pakistan and Nepal\n* [[SweatFree Communities]] - a nationwide network for local action against sweatshops\n* SweatsHope - an Australian/New Zealand organization to create a sweatshop free world and stop human trafficking\n* [[UNITE HERE]] - a labor union based in the United States and Canada dedicated to achieving higher standards for laborers \n* [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] - a student organization in the United States and Canada\n* [[Worker Rights Consortium]] - a labor rights organization focused on protecting the rights of workers who make apparel in the United States\n\n=== In Asia ===\n* [[Asia Monitor Resource Center]] - focuses on promoting democratic labor movements in Asia and the Pacific\n* [[China Labour Bulletin]] - reports on labor concerns in China\n* [[Chinese Working Women Network]] - supports and empowers Chinese migrant working women\n* [[Globalization Monitor]] - non-profit based in Hong Kong that promotes awareness on negative effects of globalization\n* [[Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee]] - empowers workers, acts as a policy watch-dog, and promotes independent trade union movements\n* [[No Sweat Shop Label and Homeworkers Code of Practice]] - corporate code of conduct to eliminate sweatshop conditions in Australia\n* [[Thai Labour Campaign]] - covers labor disputes, worker rights campaigns and labor law in Thailand\n* [[Transnationals Information Exchange]] - information on garment worker struggles in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia\n\n==Prominent campaigners==\n* [[Lady Astor]]\n* [[Alfred Deakin]]\n* [[Alfred George Gardiner]]\n* [[Vida Goldstein]]\n* [[Florence Kelley]]\n* [[Charles Kernaghan]]\n* [[Mary Reid Macarthur]]\n* [[Samuel Mauger]]\n* [[R.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info /> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.
