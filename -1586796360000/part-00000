Pace]] in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1907) defined the Beatific Vision:\n<blockquote>The immediate knowledge of God which the angelic spirits and the souls of the just enjoy in Heaven. It is called \"vision\" to distinguish it from the mediate knowledge of God which the human mind may attain in the present life. And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds perfect happiness, the vision is termed \"beatific.\"<ref>Pace, Edward. \"Beatific Vision.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2.

Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. \"Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek.\"[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article8 STh I\u2013II, q., 3, a. 8.] But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect&nbsp;\u2013 and this is God. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2002.htm#article8 STh I\u2013II, q. 2, a. 8.] And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the \"light of glory\" so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes [[Psalm 36]]:9 on this point: \"In your light we shall see light.\")[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article4 STh I, q. 12, a. 4.] Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect \"ideas\" or \"images\" of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article2 STh I, q. 12, a. 2.] The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any created image of him. This union comes about by a kind of \"seeing\" perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of \"seeing\" is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.<ref>[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], I\u2013II, qq. 2\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the Beatific Vision surpasses both [[faith]] and [[reason]]. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind's innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813155010/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/101212.htm ''Summa Theologiae'']\n\nThe Theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas thinks that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_40.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']\n\nThus only the fullness of the Beatific Vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]], Aquinas notes \"We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face\" (i Cor. 13:12). The Beatific Vision is the final reward for those saints elect by God to partake in and \"enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself\" in the next life. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_51.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']\n\n===Roman Catechism===\nAccording to the [[Roman Catechism]], the saints in heaven see God, whereby they share in God's nature, wherewith they are truly and always happy. The catechism elaborates that the saints' happiness includes not just joy, but also glory (knowledge of one another's dignity), honor (reverence for one another as adopted sons of God), and peace (fulfillment of all the heart's desires). Moreover, the catechism adds, the beatific vision will, on [[Judgment Day]], make the saints' resurrected bodies impassible (free from inconvenience, suffering, and death), bright as the angels, agile (free from the limitations of [[space-time]]), and subtle (as subject to the soul as the soul is subject to God).\n\n===Pope John XXII and the Beatific Vision controversy===\n\n[[Pope John XXII]] (1316\u20131334) caused a controversy involving the Beatific Vision.<ref>Marc Dykmans, Les sermons de Jean XXII sur la vision b\u00e9atifique, Rome, 1973</ref> He said not as Pope but as a private theologian that the saved do not attain the [[Beatific Vision]] until [[Judgment Day]], a view more consistent with [[Christian mortalism|soul sleep]].<ref>Louise Bourdua, Anne Dunlop ''Art and the Augustinian order in early Renaissance Italy''</ref> The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day.

He further taught that the amount of the beatific vision that one will enjoy will be based on one's merits. He also taught that the saints' resurrected bodies will be endowed with impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtlety.\n\n===Catechism of the Catholic Church===\nAccording to the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] and the [[Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church]], the beatific vision is God opening himself in an inexhaustible way to the saints,<ref name=\"CCC 1045\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1045 CCC 1045]</ref> so that they can see him face to face,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1028 CCC 1028]</ref> and thereby share in his nature,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1023 CCC 1023]</ref> and therefore enjoy eternal, definitive, supreme, perfect, and ever new happiness.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/compendium_ccc/documents/archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html Catechism Compendium 362]</ref><ref name=\"CCC 1045\"/><ref name=\"CCC 1024\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1024 CCC 1024]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s2a2.htm#2781 CCC 2781]</ref> The catechism teaches that this happiness includes not just communion and perfect life with the [[Trinity]] and the saints,<ref name=\"CCC 1024\"/> but also the fulfillment of all the heart's desires<ref name=\"CCC 1024\"/> - including, on Judgment Day, the body being glorified,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm#999 CCC 999]</ref> even endowed with impassibility, brightness, agility, and subtlety<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a5p2.htm#645 CCC 645]</ref> - and continual cooperation with God's will<ref name=\"CCC 1029\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1029 CCC 1029]</ref> - including praying for all other people,<ref name=\"CCC 1029\"/> even proffering one's merits to God for others' sake.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a9p5.htm#956 CCC 956]</ref> The catechism elaborates that the beatific vision is a grace and a privilege intended for everyone to attain,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a2.htm#1722 CCC 1722]</ref> but to enjoy according to each person's merit,<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a2.htm#2011 CCC 2011]</ref> and that the beatific vision is attained immediately after death - or after [[purgatory]]<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a12.htm#1032 CCC 1032]</ref> - yet it is already foretasted in [[baptism]]<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c3a1.htm#163 CCC 163]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm#1003 CCC 1003]</ref> and in the [[eucharist]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p123a11.htm#1000 CCC 1000]</ref><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a3.htm#1391 CCC 1391]</ref> The catechism also teaches that the beatific vision is expressed in different ways in the [[New Testament]]: the [[kingdom of God]], the vision of God, eternal life, divine adoption, a share in the divine nature, the joy of the Lord, and rest in God.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a2.htm#1720 CCC 1720]</ref>\n\n===Catholic Encyclopedia===\nThe [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] defines the beatific vision as the immediate knowledge of God enjoyed by all the heavenly creatures.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Beatific Vision]</ref> It explains that the vision of God is called \"beatific\" because by seeing God the mind finds perfect happiness, and called \"vision\" because the sight of God in heaven is not the same as mediate knowledge of God.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Theoria]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book | author = K.

And since in beholding God face to face the created intelligence finds perfect happiness, the vision is termed \"beatific.\"<ref>Pace, Edward. \"Beatific Vision.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2.

Nashville: The United Methodist Publishing House, 1989. 28 May 2018. <https://hymnary.org/hymn/UMH/88>.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==In the Catholic church==\n\nIn Catholic theology, the [[intercession of saints]] is valid because those who have died in the Faith are with God in Heaven and enjoy the Beatific Vision, i.e., unmediated access to God's Presence, actually in Paradise itself, seeing God.\n\n===Thomas Aquinas===\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] defined the beatific vision as the human being's \"final end\" in which one attains to a perfect happiness.  Thomas reasons that one is perfectly happy only when all one's desires are perfectly satisfied, to the degree that happiness could not increase and could not be lost. \"Man is not perfectly happy, so long as something remains for him to desire and seek.\"[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2003.htm#article8 STh I\u2013II, q., 3, a. 8.] But this kind of perfect happiness cannot be found in any physical pleasure, any amount of worldly power, any degree of temporal fame or honor, or indeed in any finite reality. It can only be found in something that is infinite and perfect&nbsp;\u2013 and this is God. [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2002.htm#article8 STh I\u2013II, q. 2, a. 8.] And since God is not a material thing but is pure spirit, we are united to God by knowing and loving him. Consequently, the most perfect union with God is the most perfect human happiness and the goal of the whole of the human life. But we cannot attain to this happiness by our own natural powers; it is a gift that must be given us by God, who strengthens us by the \"light of glory\" so that we can see him as he is, without any intermediary. (Thomas quotes [[Psalm 36]]:9 on this point: \"In your light we shall see light.\")[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article4 STh I, q. 12, a. 4.] Further, since every created image or likeness of God (including even the most perfect \"ideas\" or \"images\" of God we might generate in our minds) is necessarily finite, it would thus be infinitely less than God himself.[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1012.htm#article2 STh I, q. 12, a. 2.] The only perfect and infinite good, therefore, is God himself, which is why Aquinas argues that our perfect happiness and final end can only be the direct union with God himself and not with any created image of him. This union comes about by a kind of \"seeing\" perfectly the divine essence itself, a gift given to our intellects when God joins them directly to himself without any intermediary. And since in seeing this perfect vision of what (and who) God is, we grasp also his perfect goodness, this act of \"seeing\" is at the same time a perfect act of loving God as the highest and infinite goodness.<ref>[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]], I\u2013II, qq. 2\u20135.</ref>\n\nAccording to Aquinas, the Beatific Vision surpasses both [[faith]] and [[reason]]. Rational knowledge does not fully satisfy humankind's innate desire to know God, since reason is primarily concerned with sensible objects and thus can only infer its conclusions about God indirectly. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060813155010/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/101212.htm ''Summa Theologiae'']\n\nThe Theological virtue of faith, too, is incomplete, since Aquinas thinks that it always implies some imperfection in the understanding. The believer does not wish to remain merely on the level of faith but to grasp directly the object of faith, who is God himself. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_40.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']\n\nThus only the fullness of the Beatific Vision satisfies this fundamental desire of the human soul to know God. Quoting [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]], Aquinas notes \"We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face\" (i Cor. 13:12). The Beatific Vision is the final reward for those saints elect by God to partake in and \"enjoy the same happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees Himself\" in the next life. [http://www2.nd.edu/Departments//Maritain/etext/gc3_51.htm ''Summa Contra Gentiles'']\n\n===Roman Catechism===\nAccording to the [[Roman Catechism]], the saints in heaven see God, whereby they share in God's nature, wherewith they are truly and always happy. The catechism elaborates that the saints' happiness includes not just joy, but also glory (knowledge of one another's dignity), honor (reverence for one another as adopted sons of God), and peace (fulfillment of all the heart's desires). Moreover, the catechism adds, the beatific vision will, on [[Judgment Day]], make the saints' resurrected bodies impassible (free from inconvenience, suffering, and death), bright as the angels, agile (free from the limitations of [[space-time]]), and subtle (as subject to the soul as the soul is subject to God).\n\n===Pope John XXII and the Beatific Vision controversy===\n\n[[Pope John XXII]] (1316\u20131334) caused a controversy involving the Beatific Vision.<ref>Marc Dykmans, Les sermons de Jean XXII sur la vision b\u00e9atifique, Rome, 1973</ref> He said not as Pope but as a private theologian that the saved do not attain the [[Beatific Vision]] until [[Judgment Day]], a view more consistent with [[Christian mortalism|soul sleep]].<ref>Louise Bourdua, Anne Dunlop ''Art and the Augustinian order in early Renaissance Italy''</ref> The general understanding at the time was that the saved attained Heaven after being purified and before Judgment Day. He never proclaimed his belief as doctrine but rather as an opinion (see [[First Vatican Council|''ex cathedra'']], as defined at the First Vatican Council in 1870).\n\nThe Sacred College of Cardinals held a [[papal consistory|consistory]] on the problem in January 1334, and Pope John backed away from his novel views to the more standard understanding.\n\nHis successor, [[Pope Benedict XII]], [[Benedictus Deus (Benedict XII)|declared]] it doctrine that the saved see Heaven (and thus, God) before Judgment Day.\n\n===Pope Pius X===\n[[Pope Pius X]] in his catechism taught that, while no one can comprehend heaven, [[dogma in the Catholic Church|God has revealed]] that heaven consists of the beatific vision, which after death the soul enjoys and after [[Judgment Day]] the body and the soul will enjoy together.

The trainees (and sometimes the more experienced Chuggers) learn the value of loyal friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict without violence, and similar values. The locomotives, called \"Chuggers\", are intelligent, empathetic, independent and somewhat self-directed. They have mobile facial and body features. Chuggers have no crews, yet some have crew doors that can open. Chuggers regularly interact with other humans such as passengers and maintenance crews.\n\nThe town of Chuggington has a central area of large modern buildings. Side-by-side railway tunnels coloured red, blue, yellow, green run under the town centre, leading to the outside world. Countryside settings include a farm, a safari park, and a quarry. A \u2018Chugston Hotel\u2019 is mentioned. \"Old Chuggington\", an abandoned old town with a similar name to the titular town, overgrown with wild vegetation, is occasionally visited.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chuggington episodes}}\n{{:List of Chuggington episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n''Brewster'', ''Koko'', and ''Wilson'' are the main characters in ''Chuggington''.\n\n===Train characters===\n\n====Trainees====\n\n=====Main Trainees=====\n* Wilson{{anchor|Wilson}} (voiced by Morgan Overton in the UK in Series 1,<ref name=\"BBFC, AVV271120\" >{{cite web\n  |title=Chuggington- Wilson's Smooth Moves\n  |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AVV271120\n  |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]\n  |ref=BBFC, AVV271120\n}}</ref>  2 and 3; Edward Sharpe in the UK in Series 4 and 5, and Tony Terraciano in the US), is a red locomotive based upon an [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] [[F-unit]].

The trainees (and sometimes the more experienced Chuggers) learn the value of loyal friendship, telling the truth, listening carefully, persisting under adversity, completing tasks, resolving conflict without violence, and similar values. The locomotives, called \"Chuggers\", are intelligent, empathetic, independent and somewhat self-directed. They have mobile facial and body features. Chuggers have no crews, yet some have crew doors that can open. Chuggers regularly interact with other humans such as passengers and maintenance crews.\n\nThe town of Chuggington has a central area of large modern buildings. Side-by-side railway tunnels coloured red, blue, yellow, green run under the town centre, leading to the outside world. Countryside settings include a farm, a safari park, and a quarry. A \u2018Chugston Hotel\u2019 is mentioned. \"Old Chuggington\", an abandoned old town with a similar name to the titular town, overgrown with wild vegetation, is occasionally visited.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Chuggington episodes}}\n{{:List of Chuggington episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n''Brewster'', ''Koko'', and ''Wilson'' are the main characters in ''Chuggington''.\n\n===Train characters===\n\n====Trainees====\n\n=====Main Trainees=====\n* '''Wilson'''{{anchor|Wilson}} (voiced by Morgan Overton in the UK in Series 1,<ref name=\"BBFC, AVV271120\" >{{cite web\n  |title=Chuggington- Wilson's Smooth Moves\n  |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AVV271120\n  |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]]\n  |ref=BBFC, AVV271120\n}}</ref>  2 and 3; Edward Sharpe in the UK in Series 4 and 5, and Tony Terraciano in the US), is a red locomotive based upon an [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] [[F-unit]].

He was given the name Mahapragya. He returned to Kathmandu with one of the novices, and they lived on Nagarjuna hill with a lama named Tsering Norbu. Three of Mahapragya's friends joined them and also became monks.<ref name=\"LeVineSarah\" />\n\n==Into exile==\nThe people of Kathmandu were inspired by the sight of the men in ochre robes as they made their alms round. The Ranas didn\u2019t like Mahapragya, born a Hindu, becoming a Tibetan monk, or the monks going around the city begging. In 1926, the five monks and Tsering Norbu were expelled to India.<ref>''Studies in Nepali history and society, Volume 7, Issue 2'' (2002). Kathmandu: Mandala Book Point.

Mahapragya and Kul Man Singh, now known as Karmasheel, wandered around Tibet and then went to [[Kushinagar]], India in 1928 where they were reordained as Theravada monks.

However, in March 1930 during the [[Maha Shivaratri]] festival, he slipped into Kathmandu disguised as a woman and blending with the throngs of Indian pilgrims. He returned to Kushinagar shortly for fear of detection. He then traveled to [[Burma]] where he lived in the jungle and varied monasteries before moving to [[Kalimpong]], India in 1934.<ref>Mahapragya (2013).
