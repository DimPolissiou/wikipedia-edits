Burroughs]]. The film is narrated by an Egyptian mummy (voiced by [[Valentine Dyall]]).\n\nAfter directing the Burroughs-influenced shorts ''Towers Open Fire'' (1963) and ''The Cut Ups'' (1967), Balch approached producer Richard Gordon in 1968 to direct an anthology film running just over an hour, titled ''Multiplication''. After the script was rewritten to bring the film up to feature length and the budget doubled (32,000 [[Pound sterling|pounds]]) filming took place over 14 weeks in 1969. Released in February 1970, it was a huge success in the UK, running for six months at the Jacey Cinema in [[Piccadilly Circus]] alone, during which time it recouped its entire production cost. The film remained in circulation in the UK throughout the 1970s, sometimes appearing in a half hour edited version that played on the second half of double-bills.\n\nFive writers are credited with the script, although several other people, including [[Brion Gysin]] and Ian Cullen (writer of ''[[Cruel Passion]]'' (1977) and husband of Yvonne Quenet, who plays Mary-Claire in the film) also claimed to have worked on the writing. Many of the actresses who appear nude in the film, such as Nicole Austin and Maria Frost, were mainly topless models who had begun to get minor acting roles in British sex and horror films of the period.  Frost, who plays Lindy Leigh in the film, was so horrified she'd been given a major role in the film that she reportedly told Balch \u201cI\u2019m a model, I can't act.\u201d She had previously appeared in two [[Harrison Marks]] shorts, ''Maria'' and ''Scouts Honour''.\n\nThe dinosaur sculptures that feature in the \u201cStrange Young Man\u201d segment are the famous [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]].\n\nCommenting on the film in an unpublished 1975 interview, Balch claimed \u201cthis is a very uneven film, but three episodes and a single shot, are good. I liked the ones with the photographer, Elliot Stein, and the Lady in the Greenhouse. The episode of the monster baby is a bore, but the single shot of it, at the end is brilliant.\u201d<ref>Quoted in ''Midnight Marquee'', no. 43, 1992</ref>\n\n==Censorship history==\n\nThe film was substantially cut for the British cinema release in 1970, with censor [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]] removing over nine minutes from the film, while reportedly muttering \u201cnasty stuff\u201d. Heavily cut was the \"Spanish horse/Female photographer\" sequence, together with assorted orgy and lovemaking scenes, while shots of men in bed together in the \"Bedroom Beauties of 1929\" sequence were removed entirely. Writing in the [[Monthly Film Bulletin]] (March 1970) Jan Dawson remarked of the cuts: \u201cparadoxically, the bowdlerized version of the film moves closer to pornography than the version from which its audience is being protected. \u2026it's sad that censorship should function against its own long term purpose and re-enforce the man-in-the-mac\u2019s sexual furtiveness by denying him the chance to view sex irreverently.\u201d The film was briefly released uncut in America under the name ''Bizarre'' by [[New Line Cinema]], before being withdrawn and re-released in 1972 as ''Tales of the Bizarre'', a drastically re-edited version that deleted around 17 minutes from the film. The 1980 UK video release on the Iver Film Services label is uncut, as is the 2005 American DVD and the 2009 British DVD.\n\n==Critical reaction==\n\n* \u201can exploitation sex film informed throughout by the refreshing view that sex is less often fun than funny..

He reached the top alone, and from there descended to the finish, 6 minutes ahead of Rolland, who was still the race leader. Bobet jumped to second place in the general classification.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\nThe next challenge for the general classification were the Pyr\u00e9nees mountains. In stage 17, Gaul made the pace, and most cyclists could not follow. Bobet could hold on for a long time, but at the finish lost 84 seconds to Gaul. Because Rolland lost more than seven minutes, Bobet took the lead.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\nIn the eighteenth stage, it was again Gaul who attacked. This time, a small group including Bobet could follow him all the way. Rolland finished two minutes later, but was still in second place in the general classification.<ref name=\"mdc1955_17\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_17.php|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=42\u00e8me Tour de France 1955 - 17\u00e8me \u00e9tape|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320164750/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_17.php|archive-date=20 March 2012|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe time trial in the 21st stage was won by [[Jean Brankart]], who jumped to second place in the general classification.

Bobet became the first person in the Tour de France to win three Tours in a row.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]]. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nThe [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was calculated in the same way as in 1954, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1955, this was won by Stan Ockers.<ref name=\"mdc1955\"/>\n\nPoints for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The system was almost the same as in 1954: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Charly Gaul won this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1955\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the French team. The British team and the regional South West team finished with only two cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team classification.\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Gaul won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=46}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, [[Grimaud, Var|Grimaud]], on the [[French Riviera]].<ref name=\"stem-shd\">{{cite news|title=Temperatuur hoger dan in broeikast|trans-title=Temperature higher than in greenhouse|url=https://krantenbankzeeland.nl/issue/stm/1955-07-18/edition/null/page/5|work=[[BN DeStem|De Stem]]|date=18 July 1969|page=5|language=Dutch|via=Krantenbank Zeeland}}</ref>{{sfn|Seray|Lablaine|2006|p=84}} This prize was won by [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]] on stage 10.<ref name=\"stem-shd\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"antwerpen-final-table\">{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19550801&id=GVA-19550801-01008010|title=Ronde panorama 1955|trans-title=Tour panorama 1955|language=Dutch|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=1 August 1955|page=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216023532/http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19550801&id=GVA-19550801-01008010|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1955|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1955|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1955|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302050124/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1955|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

In both stages, [[Wout Wagtmans]] and [[Antonin Rolland]], one of Bobet's teammates, were present. Wagtmans became leader of the general classification, with Rolland in second place.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nThe first attack that was important for the general classification was in the fourth stage. Rolland was part of a group of nine cyclists that finished seven minutes before the rest. Rolland was the best-placed cyclist of those nine, and took the lead.<ref name=\"revealed\" />\n\nIn the seventh stage, Rolland briefly lost that lead, because a group including [[Wim van Est]] escaped and gained more than seventeen minutes, which was just enough for Van Est to take over the lead. Van Est was sure to lose it in the next stage, which included high mountains.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=207\u2013212}}\n\nIn that eighth stage, [[Charly Gaul]] attacked early in the stage. Gaul was more than 23 minutes behind in the general classification, but got over the mountains quickly and won with 13 minutes, which put him in third place.<ref name=\"revealed\"/><ref name=\"mdc1955_8\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_8.php|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=42\u00e8me Tour de France 1955 - 8\u00e8me \u00e9tape|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320164704/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_8.php|archive-date=20 March 2012|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the ninth stage, Gaul tried to do the same again, and got over the first three mountains alone. But because of a crash on the second mountain he lost time, and did not win the stage; instead he even lost a few minutes.{{sfn|McGann|McGann|2006|pp=207\u2013212}} During the eleventh stage, French cyclist [[Jean Mall\u00e9jac]] collapsed and remained unconscious for 15 minutes. The Tour doctor who helped recognised that Mall\u00e9jac's symptoms were identical to an [[amphetamine]] overdose, and told the team doctors to be more careful with doping.{{sfn|Dimeo|2007|p=59}} In that stage, Bobet got away on [[Mont Ventoux]] and nobody was able to follow him. He reached the top alone, and from there descended to the finish, 6 minutes ahead of Rolland, who was still the race leader. Bobet jumped to second place in the general classification.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\nThe next challenge for the general classification were the Pyr\u00e9nees mountains. In stage 17, Gaul made the pace, and most cyclists could not follow. Bobet could hold on for a long time, but at the finish lost 84 seconds to Gaul. Because Rolland lost more than seven minutes, Bobet took the lead.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\nIn the eighteenth stage, it was again Gaul who attacked. This time, a small group including Bobet could follow him all the way. Rolland finished two minutes later, but was still in second place in the general classification.<ref name=\"mdc1955_17\">{{cite web|url=http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_17.php|publisher=M\u00e9moire du cyclisme|title=42\u00e8me Tour de France 1955 - 17\u00e8me \u00e9tape|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320164750/http://memoire-du-cyclisme.net/eta_tdf_1947_1977/tdf1955_17.php|archive-date=20 March 2012|access-date=26 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nThe time trial in the 21st stage was won by [[Jean Brankart]], who jumped to second place in the general classification.

Bobet became the first person in the Tour de France to win three Tours in a row.<ref name=\"revealed\"/>\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]]. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nThe [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was calculated in the same way as in 1954, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1955, this was won by Stan Ockers.<ref name=\"mdc1955\"/>\n\nPoints for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The system was almost the same as in 1954: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Charly Gaul won this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1955\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the French team. The British team and the regional South West team finished with only two cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team classification.\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Gaul won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=46}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, [[Grimaud, Var|Grimaud]], on the [[French Riviera]].<ref name=\"stem-shd\">{{cite news|title=Temperatuur hoger dan in broeikast|trans-title=Temperature higher than in greenhouse|url=https://krantenbankzeeland.nl/issue/stm/1955-07-18/edition/null/page/5|work=[[BN DeStem|De Stem]]|date=18 July 1969|page=5|language=Dutch|via=Krantenbank Zeeland}}</ref>{{sfn|Seray|Lablaine|2006|p=84}} This prize was won by [[Andr\u00e9 Darrigade]] on stage 10.<ref name=\"stem-shd\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref name=\"antwerpen-final-table\">{{cite news|url=http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19550801&id=GVA-19550801-01008010|title=Ronde panorama 1955|trans-title=Tour panorama 1955|language=Dutch|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=1 August 1955|page=8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216023532/http://krantenarchief.concentra.be/vw/article.do?code=GVA&date=19550801&id=GVA-19550801-01008010|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 1955|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 1955|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1955|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302050124/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=1955|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Biggs, Hannigan, Scott, Nicholas, Thomas, Coolidge, Cho, Isfield, Cheek, and Owen all play their characters in four films each; other characters appear in fewer films.\n\n==Characters from ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''==\n\n===Noah Levenstein===\n[[File:Eugene Levy 2012.jpg|thumb|Levy has appeared in all released films in the ''American Pie'' film series]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Eugene Levy]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', ''American Pie Presents: Band Camp'', ''American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile'', ''American Pie Presents: Beta House'', ''American Pie Presents: The Book of Love'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Noah Levenstein''', also known as \"'''Jim's dad'''\", is the only character to appear in all eight films to date. At the 2000 [[American Comedy Awards#American Comedy Award 14|American Comedy Award]], Levy was nominated for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture although he didn't win. At the 2000 [[Blockbuster Entertainment Award]] he was nominated for Favorite Supporting Actor - Comedy which he won. At the 2002 [[Canadian Comedy Awards]] he was nominated for Pretty Funny Male Performance for his role in ''[[American Pie 2]]'' and won the award.\n\nHe first appears in ''American Pie'' where he attempts to offer sexual advice including purchasing and giving his son Jim pornography after finding him [[Masturbation|masturbating]] with a tube sock. He later finds Jim humping a [[pie]] after being previously told that [[Baseball metaphors for sex|third base]] feels like \"warm [[apple pie]]\". He later helps Jim cover the incident up and lies to his wife about the missing pie and where it has gone, telling her he ate it.\n\nHe reappears in the second film of the series where he takes Jim to the hospital after Jim decides to turn on a porn film that Stifler rented, but accidentally uses [[superglue]] instead of [[lubricant]] to masturbate, permanently gluing his entire hand to his penis and boxer shorts. He then supports Jim after he learns that he won't be able to have sex for at least a whole week, the same amount of time before the party he is attending with Nadia, who he plans on sleeping with, will be held.\n\nIn the third installment Noah arrives at the restaurant Jim is at to give him the wedding ring he was going to use to propose to girlfriend Michelle. Jim tries to hide the fact that he is being [[Fellatio|fellated]]. Not knowing Michelle is under the table, Jim's dad expresses his excitement at the proposal. Then, after Michelle bumps her head under the table in shock at hearing about the proposal, all chaos ensues as Jim ends up exposed and has to hike his pants up quickly. Saving face, he swallows what is left of his pride and asks Michelle to marry him and gets an [[erection]]. She readily agrees.\n\nHe reappears in the fourth film and the first spin off film from the main series, in which he is the camp's MACRO (Morale And Conflict Resolution Officer) and recommends that Matt Stifler start trying to fit in and earn the band's trust.\n\nHe appears again in the fifth installment, in which he is presiding over the annual Naked Mile run.\n\nHe reappears in the sixth film in which he is the Beta alumni and the last-winning team captain of the Greek Olympiad. He helps to host the competition, which includes competing to remove girls' bras the fastest, a light saber duel and catching a greased pig. The final challenge being to hold off from [[ejaculation]] while receiving a lap dance. After the Betas win, Noah, as the officiate, hands over the golden hammer to Dwight.\n\nIn the seventh film he plays a significantly smaller role, as he is not seen until near the end of the movie. He is revealed to have created \"The Bible\" (The Book of Love) while at college. After the book is destroyed, Rob, Nathan and Lube track him down to help recreate it, in which he assists them with and helps the group to recreate the manual.\n\nIn ''[[American Reunion]]'', it is revealed that his wife has died three years prior to the events portrayed in the film and that he is still [[Grief|grieving]] her loss. In the end, he finds love with Stifler's mom.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===James \"Jim\" Levenstein===\n[[File:Jason Biggs 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Jason Biggs, plays James \"Jim\" Levenstein]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Jason Biggs]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''James Emmanuel \"Jim\" Levenstein''' is the main [[protagonist]] in three out of the four primary films in the [[American Pie (series)|''American Pie'' series]] (the exception being ''American Wedding''). He is an awkward [[everyman]] who wants to lose his virginity. He first appears in ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', where he is trying to lose his virginity before the end of high school and begins to pursue [[Czech Republic|Czech]] exchange student, Nadia. Stifler persuades him to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch it together. The plan backfires, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's [[pornography]] collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read it. Jim is forced to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory. As Nadia is preparing to have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards Nadia leaves school and goes back home, now leaving Jim completely dateless for prom and ruining his chances of securing a date. Out of panic, Jim asks band geek Michelle Flaherty to the senior prom as she is apparently the only girl at his school who did not see what happened. He succeeds in getting Michelle into bed where she behaves aggressively before leaving him to wake up alone. The film ends with Jim and his friends eating breakfast before toasting to the next step.\n\nJim reappears in ''[[American Pie 2]]'' where he and his friends rent a house at [[Lake Michigan]] in the summer break at the end of their [[freshman]] year. After keeping in contact with Nadia, who is traveling across the [[United States|US]], Nadia agrees to join Jim at his beach party. When Jim decides to turn on a porn movie that Stifler rented, he accidentally uses superglue instead of lubricant to [[Masturbation|masturbate]], permanently gluing his entire hand to his penis and boxer shorts. Shocked and frightened, he takes out the porn cassette but ends up bonding the cassette to his other hand. Unable to open any doors, he climbs out of a window and stumbles onto the rooftop where he is caught by police officers. He is supported at the hospital by his father Noah, where he learns the news that he won't be able to have sex for at least a whole week, the same amount of time before the party is due to occur. When Nadia turns up earlier than expected, Michelle acts as his fake girlfriend so that he won't have to have sex with Nadia until his penis has healed. At the party Jim has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and realizes that it isn't Nadia he loves but Michelle. Nadia is upset that Jim chose a geek over her, but is happy for Jim and allows him to go and find Michelle, performing at band camp. He gatecrashes the performance with a trombone, just like he did before, but with much more style and confidence, and romantically makes out with Michelle in front of the cheering crowd.\n\nIn ''[[American Wedding]]'', Jim plays a supporting role with much less screen time in comparison to the first two films and ''Reunion''. In the opening scene, he proposes to Michelle after a few problems in attempting. She enthusiastically agrees. Jim is worried about dancing at the wedding, but salvation comes in the form of Steve Stifler, who promises to teach Jim in return of a wedding invite. Jim reluctantly agrees much to the rest of the guests disappointment. Stifler also takes charge of the bachelor party but unfortunately collides the dates with the day Jim was supposedly setting up a dinner to impress Michelle's parents. Although it appears all is ruined, Stifler and Finch cover for Jim and thankfully get the Flaherty's blessing. Scared on the days building toward the wedding, Jim shaves his pubic hair in an attempt to impress Michelle even further. However, disaster strikes as his pubes inadvertently fall into the air conditioning covering their wedding cake. A new one is made and Jim encounters another embarrassing heart-heart with his father. On the day of the wedding, Jim announces his appreciation and love for his friends Paul Finch, Kevin Myers and Steve Stifler and then happily marries Michelle.\n\nIn ''Band Camp'', Noah Levenstein informs Stifler's younger brother Matt of Michelle's pregnancy revealing that the character is to become a father. Jim is mentioned again as Noah attempts to comfort Matt, who was caught attempting to masturbate using an oboe, informing him that he caught his son engaging in sexual activity with a pie.\n\n''Naked Mile'' also alludes to Jim's paternity as Noah proudly informs Erik, Steve and Matt's younger cousin, that Michelle successfully gave birth.\n\nWhilst absent from the film, ''The Book of Love'' shows Jim's signature in the East Great Falls Bible, referencing the events of the first film.\n\nJim returns in ''[[American Reunion]]'', once again the protagonist, played by Jason Biggs. He and Michelle now have a 2-year-old son named Evan. The couple's sex life has been slowly deteriorating after the birth of their son. Throughout the film, they try to re-ignite their sexual flames. Also, Jim must avoid the advances of Kara, an 18-year-old girl he once babysat when she was young, who wants to lose her virginity to him. Seeing how her situation mirrors his own when he was her age in the original film, Jim teaches her that it is best if she waits for someone special.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Michelle Flaherty===\n[[File:Alyson Hannigan.jpg|thumb|right|Alyson Hannigan]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Alyson Hannigan]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Michelle Annabeth Flaherty''' first appears in ''American Pie'' in which she is a considerably minor character. Jim asks her to the prom as she pretends to be the only person in the school who has not seen the video of Jim prematurely ejaculating. After the prom Jim loses his virginity to Michelle who becomes volatile and later leaves him to wake up alone, which impressed him rather than upsetting him.\n\nShe reappears in ''American Pie 2'' in a much larger role. Here, her friendship with Jim grows over the summer and eventually she begins to fall in love with him. She explains that she didn't ditch Jim the morning after prom intentionally. It was done out of fear of rejection as she thought the date was over and was worried that Jim would have done the same to her. She later pretends to be Jim's girlfriend so he won't have to have sex with Nadia until his sore penis has healed. She stages a break up in front of Nadia who later goes to the party with Jim. However, Michelle is upset about Jim's interest in Nadia as opposed to her. Jim later realizes his love for Michelle, and decides to just be friends with Nadia. He goes to find Michelle at band camp, and gatecrashes the performance with a trombone and confidently kisses Michelle in front of a supportive crowd, therefore beginning a relationship with her.\n\nIn ''American Wedding'', she and Jim have continued dating and she accepts Jim's offer of marriage at the beginning of the film. Michelle settles on a dress but it is only made by one particular dressmaker so Jim and his friends set out to find him for her. Michelle and Jim's plans are almost ruined when Stifler turns up to the engagement party although they had planned to not invite him. After several misadventures, including one with the flowers being killed which Stifler later fixes, Michelle and Jim marry.\n\n''[[American Pie Band Camp|Band Camp]]'' revealed that after the events of ''American Wedding'', Michelle became an annual MACRO at Tall Oaks Band Camp. However, she could not attend in the 2005 semester as she was heavily pregnant with Jim's baby. She requested that Noah, Jim's father, take her place, a request he received with much pride. In ''Naked Mile'', Noah informs Erik Stifler that she had in fact given birth to a baby, to which he announced was a happy occasion.\n\nShe appeared in ''[[American Reunion]]''. \n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Steve Stifler===\n[[File:Seann William Scott 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seann William Scott]]]]\n* Portrayed by [[Seann William Scott]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Steven''' \"'''Steve'''\" '''Stifler''', commonly referred by his last name '''Stifler''' or his nickname '''The Stifmeister''', made his first appearance in ''American Pie'', in which he went to East Great Falls High. While not part of the sex pact, Stifler plays a crucial role in the film in two ways: (1) his post-prom party served as the setting for the film's final act, and (2) he is also a close friend of the guys, especially fellow lacrosse player Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher and Jim Levenstein. Despite his love-hate friendship with Paul Finch, it is apparent that they are still great friends. After Finch pays to have positive rumors about himself spread to all the girls in the school, one of these being that he won in a fist fight with Stifler, Stifler humiliates Finch in front of everyone by putting very strong laxative in Finch's habitual drink of mocha cappuccino. Finch, who is too uptight to use the school toilet until that time, then runs to the restroom, where Stifler helpfully holds the door open for him. It turns out to be the ladies' restroom, and Finch is publicly embarrassed. Stifler is also on the wrong end of the first of three particularly distasteful sight gags throughout the film's trilogy, where in this movie, he ingests beer containing semen. He then proceeds to vomit uncontrollably on a girl he was trying to seduce, and in the toilet.<ref name=\"american pie 1\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=1999|medium=[[DVD]]}}</ref> Stifler later catches his mother, Jeanine, and Finch having sex, and loses consciousness under the shock. This incident further ignites the [[frenemy]] relationship between Finch and Stifler.\n\nStifler's second appearance was in the sequel, ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001), with a much larger role this time. After returning from his first year at Michigan State University with Oz, Stifler attempts a reunion party at his home, which is shut down thanks to the neighbors calling the police. He helps chip in cash to rent a beach house on Lake Michigan with the rest of the group. During the summer, Stifler becomes interested in two attractive owners of a neighboring house that they were hired to paint: two females whom Stifler mistakenly regards as lesbians. As Stifler, Jim, and Finch sneak into their room, they respond to Stifler's attraction by offering to engage in varying degrees of lesbian sexual activities in front of Stifler, Jim and Finch, but only in exchange for the guys to engage in a corresponding degree of [[homoerotic]] acts that the girls enjoy watching. The first is Stifler grabbing Finch's buttocks, the second is Stifler and Jim [[french kiss]]ing, and the third one would have been for Stifler to receive a [[hand job]] from either Finch or Jim, which Stifler is the only one confident enough to do. However this freaks out Jim and Finch too much and they run off. This annoys Stifler, as the more the guys would have done, the more the girls would have done. At the main party at the beach house at the end of the film, the two girls arrive, telling Stifler they never said they were lesbians, and Stifler ends up in bed with them both.<ref name=\"american pie 2\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie 2]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2001|medium=[[DVD]]}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[American Wedding]]'', Stifler is the main [[protagonist]]. He is revealed to have become a high school football assistant coach; he also drives the team's bus. He drops in on Jim and Michelle's engagement party, much to their dismay. He is also implicated in an unusual Jim-plus-two-dogs foursome. He competes with Finch for the heart of Cadence, Michelle's younger sister. He impersonates Finch's refined and polite personality in order to win Cadence over, but Finch continues the triangle by replicating Stifler's outrageous frat boy image, which Cadence surprisingly enjoys just as much, if not more. Nevertheless, Stifler manages to bond with Cadence's family, and is eventually charged with holding Michelle's wedding ring. However, the family dog manages to ingest the ring while it is in Stifler's care, and Stifler follows it until it defecates. Stifler picks up the ring which is encapsulated within the feces using a confection paper, which Cadence's mother sees and assumes it to be one of the truffles. She insists that Stifler let her have it, but knowing he could blow his chances with Cadence for good, he suddenly devours the dog dropping into his own mouth. This carries on the tradition of rather distasteful gags where Stifler ingests various bodily substances once in each movie. Before the wedding, Stifler accidentally destroys the massive flower arrangement Michelle's family had ordered, resulting in everyone turning against him. Jim tells him to leave, and seeing how no one is on his side, Stifler complies. However, Stifler redeems himself at the end of the film: using the football team as his minions, Stifler uses his own money to buy up the entire content of a nearby flower shop and has the football team successfully set up the flowers for the wedding hours before it is to occur. By doing this, Cadence eventually falls for him and invites him to have sex in the closet. Upon following this invitation, Stifler accidentally has sex with Jim's grandmother, who was put there by John and Justin because she was \"being a bitch\". When Finch and Kevin go to collect her from the closet, they catch Stifler having sex with Jim's grandmother. Horrified by this, Stifler asks them to close the door and screams out. At the wedding, Finch taunts Stifler by whispering \"grandmother fucker\". Stifler retorts with \"Well, you're a mother fucker\", to which Finch agrees \"Yes. yes I am.\" At the reception, Stifler dances with Cadence and congratulates his friend, Jim.\n\nIn ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp|Band Camp]]'', the audience are told that Stifler has become a pornographic movie director. This movie shows that although the jocks and other popular kids pretended to like Stifler he was not liked by anyone in high school, which led Matt to reform his ways. In ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]'', he is mentioned in passing by his cousin Erik as one of the legendary Stifler boys. A picture of him can be seen on Erik's noticeboard.\n\nIn ''[[American Reunion]]'', he is portrayed in a slightly lighter fashion and can be considered somewhat of a [[tragic character]]. He now works as a temp at an investment firm, having to put up with humiliating [[verbal abuse]] from his cold-hearted employer. He yearns for the days of his youth and has trouble coping with the fact that things will never be the way they were before. Throughout the film, he attempts to re-create his teenage years (such as seeking revenge on a group of mean-spirited teens and throwing one of his trademark parties) but fails each time as his friends and everyone else have outgrown this. When Stifler learns Finch was arrested for stealing his boss' motorcycle, he finds it hilarious and believed he got his revenge on Finch because he slept with Jeanine (Stifler's mom) in the past. Meanwhile, Jim, Oz and Kevin are angered by Stifler's lack of tolerance towards their friend and rally to Finch's side. During a heated argument with the guys, Jim, Oz and Kevin reveal they don't like having Stiffer around because he always ruins their plans. Stifler is devastated and decides to skip the reunion. However, the guys soon realize how much they mean to Stifler, and how much he means to them, so they locate him at work and make amends with him. He regains his confidence and quits his job (but not before standing up to his boss). The guys proceed to attend the reunion, finally embracing Stifler as one of their own. Stifler catches up with Chuck \"Sherminator\" Sherman, and feeling regretful for how he treated him in high school, Stifler wholeheartedly helps Sherman find a woman to score with. In a surprise turn of events, he meets Finch's gorgeous mother and finally has his revenge by having sex with her on the lacrosse field as the MILF Guys, John and Justin, happily watch. In the end, the five friends all promise to stay in touch and meet up at least once a year from now on to catch up.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n=== Kevin Myers===\n* Portrayed by [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Kevin Myers''' first appears in ''American Pie'' as the suave leader of the pack, and he is the friend of Jim Levenstein, Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher, Paul Finch, Steve Stifler and the boyfriend of Vicky. The four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her first time. She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman humiliated and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college, with him attending the [[University of Michigan]] and her at [[Cornell University]]. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nKevin reappears in ''American Pie 2'' where he, Jim, Oz and Finch return to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan for the summer break after their first year of college. They attend a party hosted by Stifler, but not only does their new status as college students not give them any success with local girls, but the police also shut down the party. Kevin also has problems when he meets Vicky after their year away from each other; Vicky wants to be friends and Kevin is love-sick for her, but worried he will lose her completely. Desperately he calls his brother for advice, who tells him to move down to the beach and party hard. Together, they set off for a rented house by the beach in Grand Harbor, Michigan, where they intend to spend the whole summer, but Kevin is forced to invite Stifler along as well in order to successfully cover the costs. Kevin finds the boys jobs working as painters and decorators for a nearby house. The boys then plan to throw a huge summer party at the house, bigger than anything they've done before. The party begins at the beach house. Kevin sees his ex-girlfriend Vicky but is devastated when he sees her with a new boyfriend and leaves to go to the beach by himself. Oz, Finch and Jim follow him down, where he admits to them that he never got over Vicky and that with the party, he was hoping to relive his senior year prom night, in particular, sleeping with Vicky at the end of it. The others help Kevin realize that it will never happen, and the quartet return to the beach house to party hard.\n\nIn the third film he reappears in a much smaller role, with no significance to the plot, in contrast to the first two and latter films. As a groomsman, he aids Jim in finding the wedding dress Michelle finally settles on after long hours of searching which is made by only one designer working for one store, so Jim, Kevin and Finch, with Stifler tagging along sets out to find the dressmaker for her. They go to [[Chicago]] looking for her and end up in a gay bar. Stifler has a dance-off to make up for his meanness towards a man, Mr. Belvedere, who knows the dressmaker. In the meantime Stifler arranges a bachelor party for everyone at Jim's house except Jim who unknowingly has arranged a \"special dinner\" for Michelle's parents before the wedding. Kevin, Finch, and Stifler are then introduced to Fraulein Brandi and Officer Krystal by Mr. Belvedere and then play submissive and dominant roles with them respectively. While this is going on, Jim enters the house and Michelle's parents are badly embarrassed. Notably, he is absent from the wedding reception.\n\nIt is noted on the DVD commentary that most of Kevin's scenes were cut from the final edit, which implies he played a more relevant role than the one shown in the final cut.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Kevin has lost contact with all his former friends; apart from Jim. The two have a conversation about going to the reunion, with Kevin being very excited. He is working as an architect from home, and is married to a woman named Ellie. His life now consists of watching shows like [[Real Housewives]] and [[Desperate Housewives]]. Kevin and the others meet at a bar, where they browse through the yearbook and find Kevin's quote, \"Kevin Myers hopes to still be living it up with the beautiful Vicky Lathum.\" The next day, they all go to the beach, and Kevin and Vicky run into each other. They're still friends, and there appears to be no romantic feelings between the two of them. They go to the falls and chat to each other, getting drunk. The next morning, Kevin wakes up beside Vicky, wearing nothing but his underwear. He worries and leaves, thinking the two of them engaged in sexual intercourse. At Stifler's party, Kevin rings his wife, but Vicky enters the room. He confronts Vicky, but she says they didn't have sex and that she took his clothes off because he fell in the lake. She is angry at Kevin that he would have such low expectations about her. He fights outside against A.J. and his friend, and puts up a decent fight. When Finch is taken by the police, Kevin passionately tries to stop them by saying Finch didn't steal the motorcycle. Kevin and Vicky reconcile at the reunion, and the two of them and Ellie dance together. He is last seen at Dog Days with the others, and they all agree to meet up at least once a year from now on.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Paul Finch===\n[[File:Eddie Kaye Thomas.jpg|thumb|right|Eddie Kaye Thomas]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Paul Finch''', commonly referred by his surname '''Finch''', first appears in ''American Pie'' as a mochaccino-drinking sophisticate and he is the friend of Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers and Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher. He is a member of The nerdy four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend Jessica $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch's mochacchino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. Afterward, he emerges before many other fellow students, humiliated and is left dateless. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her first time. She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Finch strays downstairs to the basement recreation room where he meets Stifler's mother, Jeanine. She is aroused by his precociousness, and they have sex on the pool table. In the morning Stifler enters the room, realizes that his mom has had sex with Finch and faints, unable to believe that his mom and \"shitbreak\" are together. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nPaul reappears in ''American Pie 2'', where he Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Stifler return to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan for the summer break after their first year of college. They attend a party hosted by Stifler, but not only does their new status as college students not give them any success with local girls, but the police also shut down the party. After arriving in Grand Harbor, Kevin finds them work as painters and decorators for a house nearby. Stifler is intrigued by the two sexy female owners, who appear to be lesbians, and excitedly breaks into their house while they're away. Jim and Finch follow him, trying to get him out, but they are caught by the owners, who relent on calling the police. But after Stifler identifies his interest in their homosexuality, they insist on the boys performing \"like for like\" homosexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls do the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the neighborhood. After this, the boys plan to throw a huge summer party at the house, bigger than anything they've done before. Finch has become involved in the sexual art of [[Tantra]], and claims that through Tantric sex, he can \"make an orgasm last for days\". He is waiting patiently for Jeanine, hoping she will show up and be willing to have sex with him again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be Stifler's little brother Matt. Finally, the party begins at the beach house. Kevin sees his ex-girlfriend Vicky but is crushed when he sees her with a new boyfriend and leaves to go to the beach by himself. Oz, Finch and Jim follow him down, where he confides in them that he never got over Vicky and that with the party, he was hoping to relive his senior year prom night, in particular, sleeping with Vicky at the end of it. The others help Kevin realize that it will never happen, and the quartet return to the beach house to party hard. The morning after the party, a Mercedes coupe with darkened windows turns up at the house. Finch approaches to see Jeanine who has finally turned up. It doesn't take long before Finch gets into the car and drives off to the lakeside to have hard sex with her.\n\nIn the third film, Finch plays a larger role. He helps Jim find the wedding dress Michelle finally settles on after long hours of searching which is made by only one designer working for one store, so Jim, Kevin and Finch, with Stifler tagging along sets out to find the dressmaker for her. They go to Chicago looking for her and end up in a gay bar. Stifler has a dance-off to make up for his rudeness towards a man, Bear, who knows the dressmaker. In the meantime Stifler arranges a bachelor party for everyone at Jim's house except Jim who unknowingly has arranged a \"special dinner\" for Michelle's parents before the wedding. Kevin, Jim and Stifler are then introduced to Fraulein Brandi and Officer Krystal by Bear and then play submissive and dominant roles with them respectively. While this is going on, Jim enters the house and Michelle's parents are badly embarrassed. Michelle's sister Cadence attends the wedding, and Finch is quickly attracted to her. Stifler also becomes attracted to her. Upon hearing that Cadence is hoping to attract a decent guy, Stifler adopts a more meek attitude and acts like Finch, and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy. But when Finch realizes that Cadence is beginning to tire of the intellectual Stifler, Finch acts immature, rude, and perverted: in other words, like Stifler. Stifler unintentionally kills the flowers the night before the wedding, and when arguing with Finch he is heard by Cadence, who realizes his true intentions. Later, Stifler realizes that he actually feels bad about his previous actions, prompting him to bring in the football team he coaches to set up the entire room with new flowers. Ultimately, Cadence chooses Stifler, and Finch admits that Stifler was probably better for her anyway. Due to a confusion, Stifler has sex with Jim's grandmother, who opposed the wedding but is so happily distracted by this to no longer argue. Michelle and Jim eventually get married. At the reception, Finch is sitting by himself when Stifler's mom arrives. They tell each other they are over each other but at the end of the movie it shows Stifler's mom and Finch in the tub having sex. The two MILF guys are watching in awe through the window as Finch goes under the bubbles to perform oral sex on her.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Finch is an assistant manager at Staples, but is often disrespected by his boss. Having enough, he stole his boss' motorcycle when he did not receive a raise that was promised to him and took it out for a joy ride. Finch was arrested for the whole thing when the cops showed up. Stifler found the whole thing funny and believed he got his revenge on him for having sex with his mother. Disgusted with his antagonistic attitude, Jim, Oz and Kevin rallied to Finch's side and told Stifler off. He meets and falls in love with Selena when he sees they have a lot in common. Finch makes amends with Selena for lying, and they have sex in the bathroom, which promises to lead to an ongoing relationship; in the process, Finch realizes that he has moved on from Stifler's mom. He decided to go see the world with Selena. Before leaving, Finch learns that Stifler had sex with his mom, Rachel, and feels a similar disgust towards his behavior(akin to the previous times he had sex with Jeanine).\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher===\n[[File:Chris Klein 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Klein]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Christopher Russell \"Oz\" Ostreicher''' first appears in ''American Pie'' as a member of the high school lacrosse team and as a friend of Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers, Steve Stifler, and Paul Finch. He is a member of The nerdy and geeky four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Oz joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and find a girlfriend there. Even though he was never an insensitive jock and he hangs the core three who are the biggest geeks of all time that didn't exactly get him in the popular seat. He soon wins the attention of Heather, a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust. Heather sees the real Oz, not just some arrogant jock that people labeled as and see his real friends. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the porch. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favourite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'' he reappears where he and his friends rent a house at Lake Michigan in the summer break at the end of their freshman year where they plan to have a party. Oz is lonely and missing his girlfriend Heather who is away in Spain. They start having erotic phone sex to vent some of their frustration, but keep getting interrupted by various people. Heather turns up to Oz's delight later at the party.\n\nHe does not reappear in the third film, ''American Wedding'' and his absence isn't explained. In a deleted scene, it is mentioned that he and Heather are in Spain.\n\nLike the majority of the other characters (excluding Jim's Dad, Matt Stifler, and The Sherminator), Oz does not appear in any of the spin-off films but his name can be seen on the check-out card for \"The Bible\" in ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|The Book of Love]]''.\n\nHe is re-introduced into the series in ''American Reunion''. He is now a successful, wealthy sportscaster, but is best known for his embarrassing loss to [[Gilbert Gottfried]] on ''Celebrity Dance-Off''. Despite his fame and fortune, he is still not truly happy, as he and Heather are no longer together, and he has yet to have a family of his own. He shows up for the reunion with the gang, and upon seeing Jim again, he acknowledges he may have missed his wedding but he'd never miss the reunion (alluding to his absence in the previous film). In the meantime, he tries to rekindle his relationship with Heather.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Victoria \"Vicky\" Lathum===\n[[File:Tara Reid 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Tara Reid]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Tara Reid]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nVicky first appears in ''American Pie'', where she's Kevin Myers's girlfriend. At the end of ''American Pie'', Vicky breaks-up with Kevin after having sex with him at Stifler's lake-house party after the prom.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'', she appears to have moved on from Kevin, she tells Stifler and Oz and Kevin while they're playing pool, that she had sex with only one guy, which upsets Kevin, and before the last scene, Kevin admits to her that he hadn't moved on, and they agreed to be friends, then she dances with him at their lake party.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', she appears to have broken-up with her boyfriend and is living with her parents. She gets mad at Kevin for thinking they had sex after waking up in the bed with her and his clothes are off. In the last scene Kevin confesses his old feelings for her, and explains that he loves his wife but that she will always be his first love. He then introduces Vicky to his wife at the reunion where his wife insists that the three of them share a dance.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Heather===\n[[File:Mena Suvari 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Mena Suvari]]\n* Portrayed by [[Mena Suvari]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nHeather first appears in ''American Pie'' where she starts a relationship with Oz after he joins her choir group and initially turns Oz down, until he proves that he really likes Heather. It is unknown if they had sex at Stifler's after prom party.\n\nHeather reappears in ''American Pie 2'' where she is out of town and has phone sex with Oz until a foreigner and Stifler interrupt. She later surprises Oz at the party.\n\nWhile absent from ''American Wedding'', she appears in ''American Reunion'' where she has a slightly bigger role. She has broken up with Oz and dates a heart surgeon named Ron, who turns out to be a jerk, and they separate as Heather goes back to Oz.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Jessica===\n* Portrayed by [[Natasha Lyonne]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nJessica is a friend of Vicky, Finch and Kevin, and usually gives them advice on what some high school \"codes\" mean such as for example, she tells Vicky that when a man says they slept with two or more girls she says it means they slept with one or none in reality, humorously Stifler says the opposite to his friends in that he says that it equals more, not less. In ''American Pie 2'', at the lake house party, she and Stifler briefly entertain the thought that their animosity might be due to sexual tension which they immediately scoff at and laugh off. Jessica has a brief cameo at the end of ''American Reunion'' in which she has come out as a lesbian and tells Kevin to talk to Vicky. A rather lengthy deleted scene shows Jessica and Finch catching up, with Jessica also giving him some pointers on sex with Selena.\n\n===Nadia===\n[[File:Shannon Elizabeth 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Shannon Elizabeth]]\n* Portrayed by [[Shannon Elizabeth]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Nadia''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. She first appeared as an attractive Czech exchange student in ''American Pie'' who Jim attempted to lose his virginity to. Stifler persuades Jim to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch Jim with Nadia. The plan at first seems to suffer a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read it, but this makes her stay. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory. Nadia (thanks to her fetish for geeks) tells Jim to strip slowly for her after he sees her naked. When he does so, this manages to turn her on which gives Jim the chance to be deflowered. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards, Nadia leaves school and goes back home after her exchange family sees the video, leaving Jim completely dateless for prom and the likeliness of him losing his virginity before the end of high-school is gone.\n\nNadia makes her second appearance in ''American Pie 2''. Traveling across the US, Nadia agrees to join Jim at his beach party. When Nadia turns up earlier than expected, Michelle acts as his fake girlfriend so that he won't have to have sex with Nadia until his penis has healed. At the party, Jim realizes that it isn't Nadia he wants, but Michelle. Nadia is disappointed that Jim chose a geek over her, but is happy for Jim and allows him to go and find Michelle, performing at band camp. Meanwhile, the geeky Sherman mulls around at the party in a depressed mood, having abandoned his \"Sherminator\" mantra from the first film due to his abject failure with girls. By chance, he begins talking to the rejected Nadia, who is also depressed, and the two hit it off almost instantly. Nadia encourages Sherman to become the Sherminator once more, displaying a desire/fetish for geeks, and excitedly drags him into an upstairs bedroom where Sherman finally loses his virginity, to the shock of Stifler.\n\nThough she does not appear in ''American Wedding'', Jim has doubts about if he made the right decision in choosing Michelle over Nadia, after Stifler says that it was the biggest mistake Jim has ever made. This prompts Jim to have a chat with his father, Noah. Noah, who apparently has a minor attraction to Nadia, at first tries to brush off the idea of being with her but after Jim asks if he would sleep with her if he was her age and not married, Noah immediately answers \"In a heartbeat\". She is never mentioned again for the rest of the film afterwards.\n\nShe is mentioned briefly in ''The Book of Love'' as her cousin is currently attending East Great Falls High.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'' she briefly sees Jim and Michelle at the high school reunion, walking in on them having sex while showing off her boyfriend, who bears a striking resemblance to Jim.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Chuck Sherman===\n[[File:Chris Owen LF crop.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Owen]]\n* Portrayed by [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Pie Presents Band Camp'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Chuck \"The Sherminator\" Sherman''' first appears in ''American Pie'', when he claims to have lost his virginity at a party hosted by classmate Steve Stifler. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her \"first time\". She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself.\n\nHe reappears in the second film where he goes to the party hosted by Jim and his friends. Later he mulls around at the party in a depressed mood, having abandoned his \"Sherminator\" mantra from the first film due to his abject failure with girls. By chance, he begins talking to the rejected Nadia, who is also depressed, and the two hit it off almost instantly. Nadia encourages Sherman to become the Sherminator once more, displaying a desire/fetish for geeks, and excitedly drags him into an upstairs bedroom where Sherman finally loses his virginity, to the shock of Stifler.\n\nHe reappears in ''American Pie Presents: Band Camp'' when Matt Stifler plays a prank on the school band. Sherman, who is now the school's guidance counselor, decides that a worthwhile punishment would be for Stifler to attend band camp.\n\nHe has appeared at the East Great Falls High reunion in ''[[American Reunion]]''. He told Stifler he got married, had a son named Furlong and later divorced. He moves on quickly when he sees the most popular girl in high school everyone had a crush on (who has since put on considerable weight), and picks her up using his Sherminator persona.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Matt Stifler===\n* Portrayed by [[Eli Marienthal]] in ''American Pie'' and ''American Pie 2'', and [[Tad Hilgenbrink]] in ''American Pie Presents Band Camp''\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'' and ''American Pie Presents Band Camp''\n'''Matt Stifler''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. He is the younger brother of Steve Stifler and second son of Janine Stifler. His first name was not revealed until his appearance in the first spin-off Band Camp. He was featured in the first two installments in the theatrical series and then given his own straight-to-DVD spin-off, ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp]]''.\n\nMatt was first introduced to the series alongside his elder brother watching Nadia, the foreign exchange student, strip-tease in Jim Levenstein's bed room. His next appearance was in ''American Pie 2'', where he requested to stay along with his brother in their summer beach house. In this film, set a year after the first, Matt begun to show his interest in girls and even at his young age showed signs of the infamous Stifler Sex Drive. Although Steve teaches him several lessons on how to get girls, when it comes to the night of the party he simply puts Matt on watch-dog duty. Angered, Matt waits outside and begins to aimlessly work his walkie-talkie. Much to his surprise and pleasure, however, he accidentally comes across the signal of the girls across the street. After being asked who's speaking, an eager-to-impress Matt states they are in fact talking to \"the Stiffmeister\". He manages to impress the girls enough to meet up with him but his prize is cut short when his brother intervenes successfully wooing the girls into bed with him. Matt leaves the next day, his hands full of porn videos, bidding goodbye to Steve and his friends.\n\nMatt's next appearance was as a starring role in ''Band Camp'', which sees him eager to join the family business of making amateur porn films. On the day of the seniors graduation, he and his friends spray the bands instruments with pepper spray. The prank, however, is cut short after Matt accidentally left the pepper spray open and leaking in his pocket evidently burning his penis. The band, unable to see due to the spray, accidentally destroy the set inadvertently revealing Matt as the culprit. As punishment, he must endure his summer at Band Camp. Now classed by his old friends as a bandee, Matt tries to prove himself by filming his fellow band members sexual activities throughout the summer. However, as the summer progresses, Matt suddenly develops a friendship with his fellow campers and romantic feelings for the drum major Elyse, whom he had recently had an off screen relationship with prior. With the help of Mr Levenstein, Matt realizes that living in his brother's shadow and following in his footsteps isn't what he should be doing. By the end of the film, Matt reforms himself much like his older brother did in ''American Wedding''. However, he is still content on insulting his peers and still has an active sex drive but appears far less selfish, nasty and bullying.\n\nMatt's next appearance is a simple cameo in the second spin-off ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|Naked Mile]]'', where he is introduced as a picture on his younger cousin, Erik's, wall as a \"legendary Stifler Boy\", implying that whilst he learnt his lesson in Band Camp, he still acts with Stifler traits. He is mentioned again later by Mr. Levenstein after Erik asks if he could ask for some advice.\n\nHe has another cameo in ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|Book of Love]]'' as a name written on the rent card of \"The Bible\" (The School's Sex Manual), implying that he must have rented it out at some point during his school years.\n\nEvidently, Matt looks up to his older brother as a role model, and initially hopes to be just like him. However, after the events of Band Camp, he realizes that this future isn't as good as it previously seemed. Matt is notable to be possibly the only member of the Stifler family, aside from his older brother in American Wedding, to realize that the \"Stifler Legacy\" isn't necessarily a good one. He is also different from other Stiflers as Mr. Levenstein notes that people actually want to like him but they find it difficult due to the way he acts.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===John and Justin===\n[[File:John Cho 2008.jpg|thumb|right|John Cho]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[John Cho]] and Justin Isfield\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\nThe two are often referred to as the \"[[MILF (slang)|MILF]] Guys\" and are named after their portrayers, though John is the only one to have been referred to by name, which occurred in ''American Wedding''. The two first appear in ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', where they are seen at Stifler's Party. Here they are seen chanting \"MILF\" at a picture of Stifler's Mom. John also is a choir member. Though their role was brief and minor, their appearance in the film has been significant as the term \"MILF\" has since become popular due to the usage in the film by John and Justin. They are also friends with the core four Kevin, Jim, Oz and Finch.\n\nTheir next appearance is in ''[[American Pie 2]]'' in a slightly larger role. They are first seen at Stifler's party, once again. They are waiting to get into the bathroom, when they come across Paul Finch, who slept with Stifler's Mom in the first film. John and Justin admire Finch and ask him how he did it. They are next seen when John, in a memorable scene, urinates off of a balcony and onto Stifler's head, unintentionally. Justin covers his back as he does so. The two walk off and are not seen again until the climatic party scene at the beach house. They are seen getting drunk and partying with various women. The last we see of them is the two of them walking off on the beach, with John saying \"Am I gonna have a hangover? 'Cause I want one.\"\n\nThey reappear in ''[[American Wedding]]'', where John's name is revealed for the first time. The two serve as two ushers at Jim and Michelle's wedding. They are tasked with looking after Jim's grandma, but end up putting her inside a broom closet instead. John and Justin are last scene outside of Stifler's Mom's room window, peering in to see her taking a bath, where they see Paul Finch emerge from the water, performing cunnilingus on her. They once again chant \"MILF\", before the window steams up and obscures their view as Finch goes back under the water.\n\nTheir last appearance is in ''[[American Reunion]]''. John has a much bigger role in this, and his character is expanded upon, while Justin only makes a brief cameo. John and Justin's names are never mentioned as they are credited as simply \"MILF Guy #2\" and \"MILF Guy #1\", respectively. John is first seen pulling up alongside Jim's car, as he has just crashed. He is panicking and asking if he is okay, until he realizes it is Jim. The two become reacquainted and talk to each other. John reveals he is organizing the reunion. He also mentions that he and his \"MILF\" buddy Justin are not on good terms right now, and would rather not speak of him. He sees Kara get out from Jim's lap, and, thinking it's Michelle, assumes she is performing fellatio on him. John laughs and gives a thumbs up to Jim before driving off. He is again seen at Stifler's party, where he almost blows Jim's cover by saying he saw Jim and Michelle last night, but then walks off before he can elaborate on it. He later watches Oz compete on the Celebrity Dance-Off video. He helps in the fight by throwing a weapon to Finch. When the cops arrive, John runs out of the house. At the reunion, John hands out name tags to all the class of '99. He is last seen in the bleachers, watching Stifler and Finch's Mom having sexual intercourse. He is drinking heavily and is depressed, due to Justin's absence. He hears \"MILF\" uttered to the side of him, and turns to see Justin. The two repeatedly say \"MILF\" softly to each other leading into their chant \"MILF! MILF!\" and then hug; the two continue to watch Stifler and Finch's Mom have sex as they gleefully chant.\n\nDespite his effeminate behavior, according to the directors' commentary on ''American Reunion'', John is a heterosexual.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Jeanine Stifler===\n* Portrayed by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n\nAlthough the role of Jeanine is very limited, the character becomes important mostly at the end of the movies. While her first name is revealed in the second film, she is more frequently referred to as Stifler's Mom by the majority of the characters in the films.\n\nJeanine Stifler is the divorced mother of Steve and Matt Stifler. When Jim and his friends are at Stifler's house they see a picture of her. They are impressed and all want to have sex with her. Jeanine turns up at the end of the movie. She meets Paul Finch while he is exploring the house and enters the billiard room where she is sitting. Jeanine tries to seduce Paul (although the opposite is also true) and they have sex on the billiard table. They are caught by Steven.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'' there are many references to this incident. Jeanine is expected to be at the beach house where Jim, Paul, Steven and the others stay during their vacation. Paul, still in love with Jeanine, learned to control his sexual drifts via meditation and hopes to have sex with her once again. Stifler is certain this will not happen again. Just before the boys head home, a car turns up driven by Jeanine. She asks Paul if she can drive him home, to which he agrees. Stifler, who is still in the house, is told a lost tourist was asking the way and Paul decided to travel home on his own. However, Stifler is suspicious about the guys claims, demanding them to tell him who is that tourist in the car. In the next scene, Jeanine and Paul have sex in the car.\n\nIn ''American Wedding'', Paul tells Steven he had sex twice with Jeanine, further fueling his anger. Once again, Jeanine turns up at the end of the movie. She tells Paul not to be interested in her anymore, to which he agrees. However, it is now revealed they had sex more than twice. They get excited and leave. In next scene, they have sex while taking a bath.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Jeanine appears in a bigger role. She has grown tired of being looked upon as a sexual object and breaks up with a loser boyfriend. She later meets Jim's father Noah Levenstein, who is now a widower. Jeanine is smitten with Noah and they talk about their son's embarrassing moments in puberty while sharing a laugh. The two start a relationship by going to a movie, where she is touched at him for being a gentleman by treating her more like a woman.\n\n==Characters from ''[[American Pie 2]]''==\n\n===Amber and Danielle===\n* Portrayed by Lisa Arturo and [[Denise Faye]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie 2''\n'''Amber''' and '''Danielle''' are [[fictional character]]s from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s.

Jim and Finch follow him, trying to get him out, but they are caught by Amber and Danielle, who relent on calling the police. But after Stifler identifies his interest in their homosexuality, they insist on the boys performing \"like for like\" homosexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls do the same thing. The boys soon leave after they request the boys to go further than they are prepared. Stifler later goes on to have a threesome with them, when they turn out to be bisexual and are found by Matt on the walkie talkies.\n\n==Characters from ''[[American Wedding]]''==\n\n===Cadence Flaherty===\n[[File:Mad Men at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards - January Jones.jpg|thumb|right|January Jones]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[January Jones]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Wedding''\n'''Cadence Flaherty''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. She appears in ''American Wedding'' as Michelle's sister who is attending her wedding, and Finch is quickly attracted to her. Stifler also becomes attracted to her. Upon hearing that Cadence is hoping to attract a decent guy, Stifler adopts a more meek attitude and acts like Finch, and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy. But when Finch realizes that Cadence is beginning to tire of the intellectual Stifler, Finch acts immature, rude, and perverted: in other words, like Stifler. Cadence begins to catch on that her two suitors are acting like each other, so the question of who she will choose becomes more complicated. Stifler unintentionally kills the flowers the night before the wedding, and actually feels bad about it, prompting him to bring in the football team he coaches to set up the entire room with new flowers. Cadence chooses Stifler, and Finch admits that Stifler was probably better for her anyway. They broke at the end of American Wedding and she never lost her virginity. By the events of ''[[American Reunion]]'', Cadence and Stifler have broken up, and she is never mentioned.

He gladly provides strippers for the bachelor party and even parties with them. However, when Jim and the Flahertys return and interrupt the party, Bear helps the boys pretend nothing is going on by posing as an English butler named \"Mr. Belvedere\". He later attends the wedding, and dances with his date during the reception.

However, they put Grandma Levenstein in the closet due to her constant complaining in her disapproval against Jim and Michelle's wedding. Stifler walked inside the closet and believed her to be Cadence that he has sex with her. Only when Kevin and Finch open the closet, he is horrified that he had sex with Jim's grandmother, who tells him to focus more.

He gatecrashes the performance with a trombone, just like he did before, but with much more style and confidence, and romantically makes out with Michelle in front of the cheering crowd.\n\nIn ''[[American Wedding]]'', Jim plays a supporting role with much less screen time in comparison to the first two films and ''Reunion''. In the opening scene, he proposes to Michelle after a few problems in attempting. She enthusiastically agrees. Jim is worried about dancing at the wedding, but salvation comes in the form of Steve Stifler, who promises to teach Jim in return of a wedding invite. Jim reluctantly agrees much to the rest of the guests disappointment. Stifler also takes charge of the bachelor party but unfortunately collides the dates with the day Jim was supposedly setting up a dinner to impress Michelle's parents. Although it appears all is ruined, Stifler and Finch cover for Jim and thankfully get the Flaherty's blessing. Scared on the days building toward the wedding, Jim shaves his pubic hair in an attempt to impress Michelle even further. However, disaster strikes as his pubes inadvertently fall into the air conditioning covering their wedding cake. A new one is made and Jim encounters another embarrassing heart-heart with his father. On the day of the wedding, Jim announces his appreciation and love for his friends Paul Finch, Kevin Myers and Steve Stifler and then happily marries Michelle.\n\nIn ''Band Camp'', Noah Levenstein informs Stifler's younger brother Matt of Michelle's pregnancy revealing that the character is to become a father. Jim is mentioned again as Noah attempts to comfort Matt, who was caught attempting to masturbate using an oboe, informing him that he caught his son engaging in sexual activity with a pie.\n\n''Naked Mile'' also alludes to Jim's paternity as Noah proudly informs Erik, Steve and Matt's younger cousin, that Michelle successfully gave birth.\n\nWhilst absent from the film, ''The Book of Love'' shows Jim's signature in the East Great Falls Bible, referencing the events of the first film.\n\nJim returns in ''[[American Reunion]]'', once again the protagonist, played by Jason Biggs. He and Michelle now have a 2-year-old son named Evan. The couple's sex life has been slowly deteriorating after the birth of their son. Throughout the film, they try to re-ignite their sexual flames. Also, Jim must avoid the advances of Kara, an 18-year-old girl he once babysat when she was young, who wants to lose her virginity to him. Seeing how her situation mirrors his own when he was her age in the original film, Jim teaches her that it is best if she waits for someone special.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Michelle Flaherty===\n[[File:Alyson Hannigan.jpg|thumb|right|Alyson Hannigan]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Alyson Hannigan]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Michelle Annabeth Flaherty''' first appears in ''American Pie'' in which she is a considerably minor character. Jim asks her to the prom as she pretends to be the only person in the school who has not seen the video of Jim prematurely ejaculating. After the prom Jim loses his virginity to Michelle who becomes volatile and later leaves him to wake up alone, which impressed him rather than upsetting him.\n\nShe reappears in ''American Pie 2'' in a much larger role. Here, her friendship with Jim grows over the summer and eventually she begins to fall in love with him. She explains that she didn't ditch Jim the morning after prom intentionally. It was done out of fear of rejection as she thought the date was over and was worried that Jim would have done the same to her. She later pretends to be Jim's girlfriend so he won't have to have sex with Nadia until his sore penis has healed. She stages a break up in front of Nadia who later goes to the party with Jim. However, Michelle is upset about Jim's interest in Nadia as opposed to her. Jim later realizes his love for Michelle, and decides to just be friends with Nadia. He goes to find Michelle at band camp, and gatecrashes the performance with a trombone and confidently kisses Michelle in front of a supportive crowd, therefore beginning a relationship with her.\n\nIn ''American Wedding'', she and Jim have continued dating and she accepts Jim's offer of marriage at the beginning of the film. Michelle settles on a dress but it is only made by one particular dressmaker so Jim and his friends set out to find him for her. Michelle and Jim's plans are almost ruined when Stifler turns up to the engagement party although they had planned to not invite him. After several misadventures, including one with the flowers being killed which Stifler later fixes, Michelle and Jim marry.\n\n''[[American Pie Band Camp|Band Camp]]'' revealed that after the events of ''American Wedding'', Michelle became an annual MACRO at Tall Oaks Band Camp. However, she could not attend in the 2005 semester as she was heavily pregnant with Jim's baby. She requested that Noah, Jim's father, take her place, a request he received with much pride. In ''Naked Mile'', Noah informs Erik Stifler that she had in fact given birth to a baby, to which he announced was a happy occasion.\n\nShe appeared in ''[[American Reunion]]''. \n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Steve Stifler===\n[[File:Seann William Scott 2012.jpg|thumb|right|[[Seann William Scott]]]]\n* Portrayed by [[Seann William Scott]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Steven''' \"'''Steve'''\" '''Stifler''', commonly referred by his last name '''Stifler''' or his nickname '''The Stifmeister''', made his first appearance in ''American Pie'', in which he went to East Great Falls High. While not part of the sex pact, Stifler plays a crucial role in the film in two ways: (1) his post-prom party served as the setting for the film's final act, and (2) he is also a close friend of the guys, especially fellow lacrosse player Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher and Jim Levenstein. Despite his love-hate friendship with Paul Finch, it is apparent that they are still great friends. After Finch pays to have positive rumors about himself spread to all the girls in the school, one of these being that he won in a fist fight with Stifler, Stifler humiliates Finch in front of everyone by putting very strong laxative in Finch's habitual drink of mocha cappuccino. Finch, who is too uptight to use the school toilet until that time, then runs to the restroom, where Stifler helpfully holds the door open for him. It turns out to be the ladies' restroom, and Finch is publicly embarrassed. Stifler is also on the wrong end of the first of three particularly distasteful sight gags throughout the film's trilogy, where in this movie, he ingests beer containing semen. He then proceeds to vomit uncontrollably on a girl he was trying to seduce, and in the toilet.<ref name=\"american pie 1\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=1999|medium=[[DVD]]}}</ref> Stifler later catches his mother, Jeanine, and Finch having sex, and loses consciousness under the shock. This incident further ignites the [[frenemy]] relationship between Finch and Stifler.\n\nStifler's second appearance was in the sequel, ''[[American Pie 2]]'' (2001), with a much larger role this time. After returning from his first year at Michigan State University with Oz, Stifler attempts a reunion party at his home, which is shut down thanks to the neighbors calling the police. He helps chip in cash to rent a beach house on Lake Michigan with the rest of the group. During the summer, Stifler becomes interested in two attractive owners of a neighboring house that they were hired to paint: two females whom Stifler mistakenly regards as lesbians. As Stifler, Jim, and Finch sneak into their room, they respond to Stifler's attraction by offering to engage in varying degrees of lesbian sexual activities in front of Stifler, Jim and Finch, but only in exchange for the guys to engage in a corresponding degree of [[homoerotic]] acts that the girls enjoy watching. The first is Stifler grabbing Finch's buttocks, the second is Stifler and Jim [[french kiss]]ing, and the third one would have been for Stifler to receive a [[hand job]] from either Finch or Jim, which Stifler is the only one confident enough to do. However this freaks out Jim and Finch too much and they run off. This annoys Stifler, as the more the guys would have done, the more the girls would have done. At the main party at the beach house at the end of the film, the two girls arrive, telling Stifler they never said they were lesbians, and Stifler ends up in bed with them both.<ref name=\"american pie 2\">{{cite video|title=[[American Pie 2]]|publisher=[[Universal Pictures]]|date=2001|medium=[[DVD]]}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[American Wedding]]'', Stifler is the main [[protagonist]]. He is revealed to have become a high school football assistant coach; he also drives the team's bus. He drops in on Jim and Michelle's engagement party, much to their dismay. He is also implicated in an unusual Jim-plus-two-dogs foursome. He competes with Finch for the heart of Cadence, Michelle's younger sister. He impersonates Finch's refined and polite personality in order to win Cadence over, but Finch continues the triangle by replicating Stifler's outrageous frat boy image, which Cadence surprisingly enjoys just as much, if not more. Nevertheless, Stifler manages to bond with Cadence's family, and is eventually charged with holding Michelle's wedding ring. However, the family dog manages to ingest the ring while it is in Stifler's care, and Stifler follows it until it defecates. Stifler picks up the ring which is encapsulated within the feces using a confection paper, which Cadence's mother sees and assumes it to be one of the truffles. She insists that Stifler let her have it, but knowing he could blow his chances with Cadence for good, he suddenly devours the dog dropping into his own mouth. This carries on the tradition of rather distasteful gags where Stifler ingests various bodily substances once in each movie. Before the wedding, Stifler accidentally destroys the massive flower arrangement Michelle's family had ordered, resulting in everyone turning against him. Jim tells him to leave, and seeing how no one is on his side, Stifler complies. However, Stifler redeems himself at the end of the film: using the football team as his minions, Stifler uses his own money to buy up the entire content of a nearby flower shop and has the football team successfully set up the flowers for the wedding hours before it is to occur. By doing this, Cadence eventually falls for him and invites him to have sex in the closet. Upon following this invitation, Stifler accidentally has sex with Jim's grandmother, who was put there by John and Justin because she was \"being a bitch\". When Finch and Kevin go to collect her from the closet, they catch Stifler having sex with Jim's grandmother. Horrified by this, Stifler asks them to close the door and screams out. At the wedding, Finch taunts Stifler by whispering \"grandmother fucker\". Stifler retorts with \"Well, you're a mother fucker\", to which Finch agrees \"Yes. yes I am.\" At the reception, Stifler dances with Cadence and congratulates his friend, Jim.\n\nIn ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp|Band Camp]]'', the audience are told that Stifler has become a pornographic movie director. This movie shows that although the jocks and other popular kids pretended to like Stifler he was not liked by anyone in high school, which led Matt to reform his ways. In ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|The Naked Mile]]'', he is mentioned in passing by his cousin Erik as one of the legendary Stifler boys. A picture of him can be seen on Erik's noticeboard.\n\nIn ''[[American Reunion]]'', he is portrayed in a slightly lighter fashion and can be considered somewhat of a [[tragic character]]. He now works as a temp at an investment firm, having to put up with humiliating [[verbal abuse]] from his cold-hearted employer. He yearns for the days of his youth and has trouble coping with the fact that things will never be the way they were before. Throughout the film, he attempts to re-create his teenage years (such as seeking revenge on a group of mean-spirited teens and throwing one of his trademark parties) but fails each time as his friends and everyone else have outgrown this. When Stifler learns Finch was arrested for stealing his boss' motorcycle, he finds it hilarious and believed he got his revenge on Finch because he slept with Jeanine (Stifler's mom) in the past. Meanwhile, Jim, Oz and Kevin are angered by Stifler's lack of tolerance towards their friend and rally to Finch's side. During a heated argument with the guys, Jim, Oz and Kevin reveal they don't like having Stiffer around because he always ruins their plans. Stifler is devastated and decides to skip the reunion. However, the guys soon realize how much they mean to Stifler, and how much he means to them, so they locate him at work and make amends with him. He regains his confidence and quits his job (but not before standing up to his boss). The guys proceed to attend the reunion, finally embracing Stifler as one of their own. Stifler catches up with Chuck \"Sherminator\" Sherman, and feeling regretful for how he treated him in high school, Stifler wholeheartedly helps Sherman find a woman to score with. In a surprise turn of events, he meets Finch's gorgeous mother and finally has his revenge by having sex with her on the lacrosse field as the MILF Guys, John and Justin, happily watch. In the end, the five friends all promise to stay in touch and meet up at least once a year from now on to catch up.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n=== Kevin Myers===\n* Portrayed by [[Thomas Ian Nicholas]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Kevin Myers''' first appears in ''American Pie'' as the suave leader of the pack, and he is the friend of Jim Levenstein, Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher, Paul Finch, Steve Stifler and the boyfriend of Vicky. The four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Vicky later accuses Kevin of being with her only for sex, and he must try and repair his relationship with her before the upcoming prom night, when the four plan to lose their virginity. He eventually succeeds. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her first time. She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman humiliated and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Kevin and Vicky have sex in an upstairs bedroom. Vicky breaks up with Kevin afterwards on the grounds that they will drift apart when they go to college, with him attending the [[University of Michigan]] and her at [[Cornell University]]. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nKevin reappears in ''American Pie 2'' where he, Jim, Oz and Finch return to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan for the summer break after their first year of college. They attend a party hosted by Stifler, but not only does their new status as college students not give them any success with local girls, but the police also shut down the party. Kevin also has problems when he meets Vicky after their year away from each other; Vicky wants to be friends and Kevin is love-sick for her, but worried he will lose her completely. Desperately he calls his brother for advice, who tells him to move down to the beach and party hard. Together, they set off for a rented house by the beach in Grand Harbor, Michigan, where they intend to spend the whole summer, but Kevin is forced to invite Stifler along as well in order to successfully cover the costs. Kevin finds the boys jobs working as painters and decorators for a nearby house. The boys then plan to throw a huge summer party at the house, bigger than anything they've done before. The party begins at the beach house. Kevin sees his ex-girlfriend Vicky but is devastated when he sees her with a new boyfriend and leaves to go to the beach by himself. Oz, Finch and Jim follow him down, where he admits to them that he never got over Vicky and that with the party, he was hoping to relive his senior year prom night, in particular, sleeping with Vicky at the end of it. The others help Kevin realize that it will never happen, and the quartet return to the beach house to party hard.\n\nIn the third film he reappears in a much smaller role, with no significance to the plot, in contrast to the first two and latter films. As a groomsman, he aids Jim in finding the wedding dress Michelle finally settles on after long hours of searching which is made by only one designer working for one store, so Jim, Kevin and Finch, with Stifler tagging along sets out to find the dressmaker for her. They go to [[Chicago]] looking for her and end up in a gay bar. Stifler has a dance-off to make up for his meanness towards a man, Mr. Belvedere, who knows the dressmaker. In the meantime Stifler arranges a bachelor party for everyone at Jim's house except Jim who unknowingly has arranged a \"special dinner\" for Michelle's parents before the wedding. Kevin, Finch, and Stifler are then introduced to Fraulein Brandi and Officer Krystal by Mr. Belvedere and then play submissive and dominant roles with them respectively. While this is going on, Jim enters the house and Michelle's parents are badly embarrassed. Notably, he is absent from the wedding reception.\n\nIt is noted on the DVD commentary that most of Kevin's scenes were cut from the final edit, which implies he played a more relevant role than the one shown in the final cut.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Kevin has lost contact with all his former friends; apart from Jim. The two have a conversation about going to the reunion, with Kevin being very excited. He is working as an architect from home, and is married to a woman named Ellie. His life now consists of watching shows like [[Real Housewives]] and [[Desperate Housewives]]. Kevin and the others meet at a bar, where they browse through the yearbook and find Kevin's quote, \"Kevin Myers hopes to still be living it up with the beautiful Vicky Lathum.\" The next day, they all go to the beach, and Kevin and Vicky run into each other. They're still friends, and there appears to be no romantic feelings between the two of them. They go to the falls and chat to each other, getting drunk. The next morning, Kevin wakes up beside Vicky, wearing nothing but his underwear. He worries and leaves, thinking the two of them engaged in sexual intercourse. At Stifler's party, Kevin rings his wife, but Vicky enters the room. He confronts Vicky, but she says they didn't have sex and that she took his clothes off because he fell in the lake. She is angry at Kevin that he would have such low expectations about her. He fights outside against A.J. and his friend, and puts up a decent fight. When Finch is taken by the police, Kevin passionately tries to stop them by saying Finch didn't steal the motorcycle. Kevin and Vicky reconcile at the reunion, and the two of them and Ellie dance together. He is last seen at Dog Days with the others, and they all agree to meet up at least once a year from now on.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Paul Finch===\n[[File:Eddie Kaye Thomas.jpg|thumb|right|Eddie Kaye Thomas]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Paul Finch''', commonly referred by his surname '''Finch''', first appears in ''American Pie'' as a mochaccino-drinking sophisticate and he is the friend of Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers and Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher. He is a member of The nerdy four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Finch, meanwhile, pays Vicky's friend Jessica $200 to spread rumors around the school of his sexual prowess, hoping that it will increase his chances of success. Unfortunately, he runs into trouble when Stifler, angry that a girl turned him down for the prom because she was waiting for Finch to ask her, puts a laxative into Finch's mochacchino. Finch, being paranoid about the lack of cleanliness in the school restrooms, and unable to go home to use the toilet as he usually does, is tricked by Stifler into using the girls' restroom. Afterward, he emerges before many other fellow students, humiliated and is left dateless. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her first time. She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself. The revelation takes the pressure off of Jim, Kevin, Oz and Finch, and they head to the post-prom party with new hope. At the after-party at Stifler's house, all four boys fulfill their pledge. Finch strays downstairs to the basement recreation room where he meets Stifler's mother, Jeanine. She is aroused by his precociousness, and they have sex on the pool table. In the morning Stifler enters the room, realizes that his mom has had sex with Finch and faints, unable to believe that his mom and \"shitbreak\" are together. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favorite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nPaul reappears in ''American Pie 2'', where he Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Stifler return to their hometown in East Great Falls, Michigan for the summer break after their first year of college. They attend a party hosted by Stifler, but not only does their new status as college students not give them any success with local girls, but the police also shut down the party. After arriving in Grand Harbor, Kevin finds them work as painters and decorators for a house nearby. Stifler is intrigued by the two sexy female owners, who appear to be lesbians, and excitedly breaks into their house while they're away. Jim and Finch follow him, trying to get him out, but they are caught by the owners, who relent on calling the police. But after Stifler identifies his interest in their homosexuality, they insist on the boys performing \"like for like\" homosexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls do the same thing. Oz and Kevin take turns watching up a ladder and listening on the walkie-talkie also in the room. The conversation is accidentally picked up and heard by many other people in the neighborhood. After this, the boys plan to throw a huge summer party at the house, bigger than anything they've done before. Finch has become involved in the sexual art of [[Tantra]], and claims that through Tantric sex, he can \"make an orgasm last for days\". He is waiting patiently for Jeanine, hoping she will show up and be willing to have sex with him again. He thinks she arrives when a vehicle turns up after Stifler is talking on the phone, but it turns out to be Stifler's little brother Matt. Finally, the party begins at the beach house. Kevin sees his ex-girlfriend Vicky but is crushed when he sees her with a new boyfriend and leaves to go to the beach by himself. Oz, Finch and Jim follow him down, where he confides in them that he never got over Vicky and that with the party, he was hoping to relive his senior year prom night, in particular, sleeping with Vicky at the end of it. The others help Kevin realize that it will never happen, and the quartet return to the beach house to party hard. The morning after the party, a Mercedes coupe with darkened windows turns up at the house. Finch approaches to see Jeanine who has finally turned up. It doesn't take long before Finch gets into the car and drives off to the lakeside to have hard sex with her.\n\nIn the third film, Finch plays a larger role. He helps Jim find the wedding dress Michelle finally settles on after long hours of searching which is made by only one designer working for one store, so Jim, Kevin and Finch, with Stifler tagging along sets out to find the dressmaker for her. They go to Chicago looking for her and end up in a gay bar. Stifler has a dance-off to make up for his rudeness towards a man, Bear, who knows the dressmaker. In the meantime Stifler arranges a bachelor party for everyone at Jim's house except Jim who unknowingly has arranged a \"special dinner\" for Michelle's parents before the wedding. Kevin, Jim and Stifler are then introduced to Fraulein Brandi and Officer Krystal by Bear and then play submissive and dominant roles with them respectively. While this is going on, Jim enters the house and Michelle's parents are badly embarrassed. Michelle's sister Cadence attends the wedding, and Finch is quickly attracted to her. Stifler also becomes attracted to her. Upon hearing that Cadence is hoping to attract a decent guy, Stifler adopts a more meek attitude and acts like Finch, and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy. But when Finch realizes that Cadence is beginning to tire of the intellectual Stifler, Finch acts immature, rude, and perverted: in other words, like Stifler. Stifler unintentionally kills the flowers the night before the wedding, and when arguing with Finch he is heard by Cadence, who realizes his true intentions. Later, Stifler realizes that he actually feels bad about his previous actions, prompting him to bring in the football team he coaches to set up the entire room with new flowers. Ultimately, Cadence chooses Stifler, and Finch admits that Stifler was probably better for her anyway. Due to a confusion, Stifler has sex with Jim's grandmother, who opposed the wedding but is so happily distracted by this to no longer argue. Michelle and Jim eventually get married. At the reception, Finch is sitting by himself when Stifler's mom arrives. They tell each other they are over each other but at the end of the movie it shows Stifler's mom and Finch in the tub having sex. The two MILF guys are watching in awe through the window as Finch goes under the bubbles to perform oral sex on her.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Finch is an assistant manager at Staples, but is often disrespected by his boss. Having enough, he stole his boss' motorcycle when he did not receive a raise that was promised to him and took it out for a joy ride. Finch was arrested for the whole thing when the cops showed up. Stifler found the whole thing funny and believed he got his revenge on him for having sex with his mother. Disgusted with his antagonistic attitude, Jim, Oz and Kevin rallied to Finch's side and told Stifler off. He meets and falls in love with Selena when he sees they have a lot in common. Finch makes amends with Selena for lying, and they have sex in the bathroom, which promises to lead to an ongoing relationship; in the process, Finch realizes that he has moved on from Stifler's mom. He decided to go see the world with Selena. Before leaving, Finch learns that Stifler had sex with his mom, Rachel, and feels a similar disgust towards his behavior(akin to the previous times he had sex with Jeanine).\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Chris \"Oz\" Ostreicher===\n[[File:Chris Klein 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Klein]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Chris Klein (actor)|Chris Klein]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Christopher Russell \"Oz\" Ostreicher''' first appears in ''American Pie'' as a member of the high school lacrosse team and as a friend of Jim Levenstein, Kevin Myers, Steve Stifler, and Paul Finch. He is a member of The nerdy and geeky four friends make a pact to lose their virginity before they graduate from high school. Oz joins the jazz choir in an effort to lose his reputation as an insensitive jock and find a girlfriend there. Even though he was never an insensitive jock and he hangs the core three who are the biggest geeks of all time that didn't exactly get him in the popular seat. He soon wins the attention of Heather, a girl in the choir. However, he runs into problems when Heather comes to learn about Oz's reputation and subsequently breaks up with him, although he later manages to regain some of her trust. Heather sees the real Oz, not just some arrogant jock that people labeled as and see his real friends. Oz confesses the pact to Heather, and renounces it, saying that just by them being together makes him a winner. They reconcile and wind up making love together on the porch. Oz, honoring his newfound sensitivity, never confesses to what they did. The morning after the prom Jim, Kevin, Oz, and Finch eat breakfast at their favourite restaurant where they toast to the future.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'' he reappears where he and his friends rent a house at Lake Michigan in the summer break at the end of their freshman year where they plan to have a party. Oz is lonely and missing his girlfriend Heather who is away in Spain. They start having erotic phone sex to vent some of their frustration, but keep getting interrupted by various people. Heather turns up to Oz's delight later at the party.\n\nHe does not reappear in the third film, ''American Wedding'' and his absence isn't explained. In a deleted scene, it is mentioned that he and Heather are in Spain.\n\nLike the majority of the other characters (excluding Jim's Dad, Matt Stifler, and The Sherminator), Oz does not appear in any of the spin-off films but his name can be seen on the check-out card for \"The Bible\" in ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|The Book of Love]]''.\n\nHe is re-introduced into the series in ''American Reunion''. He is now a successful, wealthy sportscaster, but is best known for his embarrassing loss to [[Gilbert Gottfried]] on ''Celebrity Dance-Off''. Despite his fame and fortune, he is still not truly happy, as he and Heather are no longer together, and he has yet to have a family of his own. He shows up for the reunion with the gang, and upon seeing Jim again, he acknowledges he may have missed his wedding but he'd never miss the reunion (alluding to his absence in the previous film). In the meantime, he tries to rekindle his relationship with Heather.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Victoria \"Vicky\" Lathum===\n[[File:Tara Reid 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Tara Reid]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[Tara Reid]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nVicky first appears in ''American Pie'', where she's Kevin Myers's girlfriend. At the end of ''American Pie'', Vicky breaks-up with Kevin after having sex with him at Stifler's lake-house party after the prom.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'', she appears to have moved on from Kevin, she tells Stifler and Oz and Kevin while they're playing pool, that she had sex with only one guy, which upsets Kevin, and before the last scene, Kevin admits to her that he hadn't moved on, and they agreed to be friends, then she dances with him at their lake party.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', she appears to have broken-up with her boyfriend and is living with her parents. She gets mad at Kevin for thinking they had sex after waking up in the bed with her and his clothes are off. In the last scene Kevin confesses his old feelings for her, and explains that he loves his wife but that she will always be his first love. He then introduces Vicky to his wife at the reunion where his wife insists that the three of them share a dance.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Heather===\n[[File:Mena Suvari 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Mena Suvari]]\n* Portrayed by [[Mena Suvari]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nHeather first appears in ''American Pie'' where she starts a relationship with Oz after he joins her choir group and initially turns Oz down, until he proves that he really likes Heather. It is unknown if they had sex at Stifler's after prom party.\n\nHeather reappears in ''American Pie 2'' where she is out of town and has phone sex with Oz until a foreigner and Stifler interrupt. She later surprises Oz at the party.\n\nWhile absent from ''American Wedding'', she appears in ''American Reunion'' where she has a slightly bigger role. She has broken up with Oz and dates a heart surgeon named Ron, who turns out to be a jerk, and they separate as Heather goes back to Oz.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Jessica===\n* Portrayed by [[Natasha Lyonne]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\nJessica is a friend of Vicky, Finch and Kevin, and usually gives them advice on what some high school \"codes\" mean such as for example, she tells Vicky that when a man says they slept with two or more girls she says it means they slept with one or none in reality, humorously Stifler says the opposite to his friends in that he says that it equals more, not less. In ''American Pie 2'', at the lake house party, she and Stifler briefly entertain the thought that their animosity might be due to sexual tension which they immediately scoff at and laugh off. Jessica has a brief cameo at the end of ''American Reunion'' in which she has come out as a lesbian and tells Kevin to talk to Vicky. A rather lengthy deleted scene shows Jessica and Finch catching up, with Jessica also giving him some pointers on sex with Selena.\n\n===Nadia===\n[[File:Shannon Elizabeth 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Shannon Elizabeth]]\n* Portrayed by [[Shannon Elizabeth]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Nadia''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. She first appeared as an attractive Czech exchange student in ''American Pie'' who Jim attempted to lose his virginity to. Stifler persuades Jim to set up a webcam in his room so that they can all watch Jim with Nadia. The plan at first seems to suffer a hiccup, though, when Nadia discovers Jim's pornography collection and sits half-naked on his bed to read it, but this makes her stay. Jim is persuaded to return to his room, where he joins Nadia, unaware that he accidentally sent the weblink to the entire school directory. Nadia (thanks to her fetish for geeks) tells Jim to strip slowly for her after he sees her naked. When he does so, this manages to turn her on which gives Jim the chance to be deflowered. As Nadia is preparing to have sex with him, he prematurely ejaculates twice, humiliating himself live in front of the entire school. Shortly afterwards, Nadia leaves school and goes back home after her exchange family sees the video, leaving Jim completely dateless for prom and the likeliness of him losing his virginity before the end of high-school is gone.\n\nNadia makes her second appearance in ''American Pie 2''. Traveling across the US, Nadia agrees to join Jim at his beach party. When Nadia turns up earlier than expected, Michelle acts as his fake girlfriend so that he won't have to have sex with Nadia until his penis has healed. At the party, Jim realizes that it isn't Nadia he wants, but Michelle. Nadia is disappointed that Jim chose a geek over her, but is happy for Jim and allows him to go and find Michelle, performing at band camp. Meanwhile, the geeky Sherman mulls around at the party in a depressed mood, having abandoned his \"Sherminator\" mantra from the first film due to his abject failure with girls. By chance, he begins talking to the rejected Nadia, who is also depressed, and the two hit it off almost instantly. Nadia encourages Sherman to become the Sherminator once more, displaying a desire/fetish for geeks, and excitedly drags him into an upstairs bedroom where Sherman finally loses his virginity, to the shock of Stifler.\n\nThough she does not appear in ''American Wedding'', Jim has doubts about if he made the right decision in choosing Michelle over Nadia, after Stifler says that it was the biggest mistake Jim has ever made. This prompts Jim to have a chat with his father, Noah. Noah, who apparently has a minor attraction to Nadia, at first tries to brush off the idea of being with her but after Jim asks if he would sleep with her if he was her age and not married, Noah immediately answers \"In a heartbeat\". She is never mentioned again for the rest of the film afterwards.\n\nShe is mentioned briefly in ''The Book of Love'' as her cousin is currently attending East Great Falls High.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'' she briefly sees Jim and Michelle at the high school reunion, walking in on them having sex while showing off her boyfriend, who bears a striking resemblance to Jim.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Chuck Sherman===\n[[File:Chris Owen LF crop.jpg|thumb|right|Chris Owen]]\n* Portrayed by [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Pie Presents Band Camp'', and ''American Reunion''\n'''Chuck \"The Sherminator\" Sherman''' first appears in ''American Pie'', when he claims to have lost his virginity at a party hosted by classmate Steve Stifler. At the prom, everything seems hopeless for the four boys until Vicky asks the girl that Chuck Sherman claimed to have bedded about her \"first time\". She proclaims to everyone at the prom that she and Sherman did not have sex at Stifler's party, leaving Sherman embarrassed and making him wet himself.\n\nHe reappears in the second film where he goes to the party hosted by Jim and his friends. Later he mulls around at the party in a depressed mood, having abandoned his \"Sherminator\" mantra from the first film due to his abject failure with girls. By chance, he begins talking to the rejected Nadia, who is also depressed, and the two hit it off almost instantly. Nadia encourages Sherman to become the Sherminator once more, displaying a desire/fetish for geeks, and excitedly drags him into an upstairs bedroom where Sherman finally loses his virginity, to the shock of Stifler.\n\nHe reappears in ''American Pie Presents: Band Camp'' when Matt Stifler plays a prank on the school band. Sherman, who is now the school's guidance counselor, decides that a worthwhile punishment would be for Stifler to attend band camp.\n\nHe has appeared at the East Great Falls High reunion in ''[[American Reunion]]''. He told Stifler he got married, had a son named Furlong and later divorced. He moves on quickly when he sees the most popular girl in high school everyone had a crush on (who has since put on considerable weight), and picks her up using his Sherminator persona.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Matt Stifler===\n* Portrayed by [[Eli Marienthal]] in ''American Pie'' and ''American Pie 2'', and [[Tad Hilgenbrink]] in ''American Pie Presents Band Camp''\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'' and ''American Pie Presents Band Camp''\n'''Matt Stifler''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. He is the younger brother of Steve Stifler and second son of Janine Stifler. His first name was not revealed until his appearance in the first spin-off Band Camp. He was featured in the first two installments in the theatrical series and then given his own straight-to-DVD spin-off, ''[[American Pie Presents: Band Camp]]''.\n\nMatt was first introduced to the series alongside his elder brother watching Nadia, the foreign exchange student, strip-tease in Jim Levenstein's bed room. His next appearance was in ''American Pie 2'', where he requested to stay along with his brother in their summer beach house. In this film, set a year after the first, Matt begun to show his interest in girls and even at his young age showed signs of the infamous Stifler Sex Drive. Although Steve teaches him several lessons on how to get girls, when it comes to the night of the party he simply puts Matt on watch-dog duty. Angered, Matt waits outside and begins to aimlessly work his walkie-talkie. Much to his surprise and pleasure, however, he accidentally comes across the signal of the girls across the street. After being asked who's speaking, an eager-to-impress Matt states they are in fact talking to \"the Stiffmeister\". He manages to impress the girls enough to meet up with him but his prize is cut short when his brother intervenes successfully wooing the girls into bed with him. Matt leaves the next day, his hands full of porn videos, bidding goodbye to Steve and his friends.\n\nMatt's next appearance was as a starring role in ''Band Camp'', which sees him eager to join the family business of making amateur porn films. On the day of the seniors graduation, he and his friends spray the bands instruments with pepper spray. The prank, however, is cut short after Matt accidentally left the pepper spray open and leaking in his pocket evidently burning his penis. The band, unable to see due to the spray, accidentally destroy the set inadvertently revealing Matt as the culprit. As punishment, he must endure his summer at Band Camp. Now classed by his old friends as a bandee, Matt tries to prove himself by filming his fellow band members sexual activities throughout the summer. However, as the summer progresses, Matt suddenly develops a friendship with his fellow campers and romantic feelings for the drum major Elyse, whom he had recently had an off screen relationship with prior. With the help of Mr Levenstein, Matt realizes that living in his brother's shadow and following in his footsteps isn't what he should be doing. By the end of the film, Matt reforms himself much like his older brother did in ''American Wedding''. However, he is still content on insulting his peers and still has an active sex drive but appears far less selfish, nasty and bullying.\n\nMatt's next appearance is a simple cameo in the second spin-off ''[[American Pie Presents: The Naked Mile|Naked Mile]]'', where he is introduced as a picture on his younger cousin, Erik's, wall as a \"legendary Stifler Boy\", implying that whilst he learnt his lesson in Band Camp, he still acts with Stifler traits. He is mentioned again later by Mr. Levenstein after Erik asks if he could ask for some advice.\n\nHe has another cameo in ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love|Book of Love]]'' as a name written on the rent card of \"The Bible\" (The School's Sex Manual), implying that he must have rented it out at some point during his school years.\n\nEvidently, Matt looks up to his older brother as a role model, and initially hopes to be just like him. However, after the events of Band Camp, he realizes that this future isn't as good as it previously seemed. Matt is notable to be possibly the only member of the Stifler family, aside from his older brother in American Wedding, to realize that the \"Stifler Legacy\" isn't necessarily a good one. He is also different from other Stiflers as Mr. Levenstein notes that people actually want to like him but they find it difficult due to the way he acts.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===John and Justin===\n[[File:John Cho 2008.jpg|thumb|right|John Cho]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[John Cho]] and Justin Isfield\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\nThe two are often referred to as the \"[[MILF (slang)|MILF]] Guys\" and are named after their portrayers, though John is the only one to have been referred to by name, which occurred in ''American Wedding''. The two first appear in ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'', where they are seen at Stifler's Party. Here they are seen chanting \"MILF\" at a picture of Stifler's Mom. John also is a choir member. Though their role was brief and minor, their appearance in the film has been significant as the term \"MILF\" has since become popular due to the usage in the film by John and Justin. They are also friends with the core four Kevin, Jim, Oz and Finch.\n\nTheir next appearance is in ''[[American Pie 2]]'' in a slightly larger role. They are first seen at Stifler's party, once again. They are waiting to get into the bathroom, when they come across Paul Finch, who slept with Stifler's Mom in the first film. John and Justin admire Finch and ask him how he did it. They are next seen when John, in a memorable scene, urinates off of a balcony and onto Stifler's head, unintentionally. Justin covers his back as he does so. The two walk off and are not seen again until the climatic party scene at the beach house. They are seen getting drunk and partying with various women. The last we see of them is the two of them walking off on the beach, with John saying \"Am I gonna have a hangover? 'Cause I want one.\"\n\nThey reappear in ''[[American Wedding]]'', where John's name is revealed for the first time. The two serve as two ushers at Jim and Michelle's wedding. They are tasked with looking after Jim's grandma, but end up putting her inside a broom closet instead. John and Justin are last scene outside of Stifler's Mom's room window, peering in to see her taking a bath, where they see Paul Finch emerge from the water, performing cunnilingus on her. They once again chant \"MILF\", before the window steams up and obscures their view as Finch goes back under the water.\n\nTheir last appearance is in ''[[American Reunion]]''. John has a much bigger role in this, and his character is expanded upon, while Justin only makes a brief cameo. John and Justin's names are never mentioned as they are credited as simply \"MILF Guy #2\" and \"MILF Guy #1\", respectively. John is first seen pulling up alongside Jim's car, as he has just crashed. He is panicking and asking if he is okay, until he realizes it is Jim. The two become reacquainted and talk to each other. John reveals he is organizing the reunion. He also mentions that he and his \"MILF\" buddy Justin are not on good terms right now, and would rather not speak of him. He sees Kara get out from Jim's lap, and, thinking it's Michelle, assumes she is performing fellatio on him. John laughs and gives a thumbs up to Jim before driving off. He is again seen at Stifler's party, where he almost blows Jim's cover by saying he saw Jim and Michelle last night, but then walks off before he can elaborate on it. He later watches Oz compete on the Celebrity Dance-Off video. He helps in the fight by throwing a weapon to Finch. When the cops arrive, John runs out of the house. At the reunion, John hands out name tags to all the class of '99. He is last seen in the bleachers, watching Stifler and Finch's Mom having sexual intercourse. He is drinking heavily and is depressed, due to Justin's absence. He hears \"MILF\" uttered to the side of him, and turns to see Justin. The two repeatedly say \"MILF\" softly to each other leading into their chant \"MILF! MILF!\" and then hug; the two continue to watch Stifler and Finch's Mom have sex as they gleefully chant.\n\nDespite his effeminate behavior, according to the directors' commentary on ''American Reunion'', John is a heterosexual.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n===Jeanine Stifler===\n* Portrayed by [[Jennifer Coolidge]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie'', ''American Pie 2'', ''American Wedding'', and ''American Reunion''\n\nAlthough the role of Jeanine is very limited, the character becomes important mostly at the end of the movies. While her first name is revealed in the second film, she is more frequently referred to as Stifler's Mom by the majority of the characters in the films.\n\nJeanine Stifler is the divorced mother of Steve and Matt Stifler. When Jim and his friends are at Stifler's house they see a picture of her. They are impressed and all want to have sex with her. Jeanine turns up at the end of the movie. She meets Paul Finch while he is exploring the house and enters the billiard room where she is sitting. Jeanine tries to seduce Paul (although the opposite is also true) and they have sex on the billiard table. They are caught by Steven.\n\nIn ''American Pie 2'' there are many references to this incident. Jeanine is expected to be at the beach house where Jim, Paul, Steven and the others stay during their vacation. Paul, still in love with Jeanine, learned to control his sexual drifts via meditation and hopes to have sex with her once again. Stifler is certain this will not happen again. Just before the boys head home, a car turns up driven by Jeanine. She asks Paul if she can drive him home, to which he agrees. Stifler, who is still in the house, is told a lost tourist was asking the way and Paul decided to travel home on his own. However, Stifler is suspicious about the guys claims, demanding them to tell him who is that tourist in the car. In the next scene, Jeanine and Paul have sex in the car.\n\nIn ''American Wedding'', Paul tells Steven he had sex twice with Jeanine, further fueling his anger. Once again, Jeanine turns up at the end of the movie. She tells Paul not to be interested in her anymore, to which he agrees. However, it is now revealed they had sex more than twice. They get excited and leave. In next scene, they have sex while taking a bath.\n\nIn ''American Reunion'', Jeanine appears in a bigger role. She has grown tired of being looked upon as a sexual object and breaks up with a loser boyfriend. She later meets Jim's father Noah Levenstein, who is now a widower. Jeanine is smitten with Noah and they talk about their son's embarrassing moments in puberty while sharing a laugh. The two start a relationship by going to a movie, where she is touched at him for being a gentleman by treating her more like a woman.\n\n==Characters from ''[[American Pie 2]]''==\n\n===Amber and Danielle===\n* Portrayed by Lisa Arturo and [[Denise Faye]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Pie 2''\n'''Amber''' and '''Danielle''' are [[fictional character]]s from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s.

Jim and Finch follow him, trying to get him out, but they are caught by Amber and Danielle, who relent on calling the police. But after Stifler identifies his interest in their homosexuality, they insist on the boys performing \"like for like\" homosexual acts on each other in return for being able to watch the girls do the same thing. The boys soon leave after they request the boys to go further than they are prepared. Stifler later goes on to have a threesome with them, when they turn out to be bisexual and are found by Matt on the walkie talkies.\n\n==Characters from ''[[American Wedding]]''==\n\n===Cadence Flaherty===\n[[File:Mad Men at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards - January Jones.jpg|thumb|right|January Jones]]\n\n* Portrayed by [[January Jones]]\n* Appeared in: ''American Wedding''\n'''Cadence Flaherty''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[American Pie (film series)|''American Pie'' series]] of [[teen film|teen]] [[comedy film]]s. She appears in ''American Wedding'' as Michelle's sister who is attending her wedding, and Finch is quickly attracted to her. Stifler also becomes attracted to her. Upon hearing that Cadence is hoping to attract a decent guy, Stifler adopts a more meek attitude and acts like Finch, and avoids swearing and speaks of philosophy. But when Finch realizes that Cadence is beginning to tire of the intellectual Stifler, Finch acts immature, rude, and perverted: in other words, like Stifler. Cadence begins to catch on that her two suitors are acting like each other, so the question of who she will choose becomes more complicated. Stifler unintentionally kills the flowers the night before the wedding, and actually feels bad about it, prompting him to bring in the football team he coaches to set up the entire room with new flowers. Cadence chooses Stifler, and Finch admits that Stifler was probably better for her anyway. They broke at the end of American Wedding and she never lost her virginity. By the events of ''[[American Reunion]]'', Cadence and Stifler have broken up, and she is never mentioned.

He gladly provides strippers for the bachelor party and even parties with them. However, when Jim and the Flahertys return and interrupt the party, Bear helps the boys pretend nothing is going on by posing as an English butler named \"Mr. Belvedere\".

However, they put Grandma Levenstein in the closet due to her constant complaining in her disapproval against Jim and Michelle's wedding. Stifler walked inside the closet and believed her to be Cadence that he has sex with her. Only when Kevin and Finch open the closet, he is horrified that he had sex with Jim's grandmother, who tells him to focus more.

Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1954, this was won by Ferdinand K\u00fcbler.<ref name=\"mdc1954\"/>\n\nPoints for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The system was almost the same as in 1953: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Federico Bahamontes won this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1954\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the Swiss team.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=45}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. At the end of the Tour de France, [[Lucien Lazarid\u00e8s]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9]] were leading this classification with equal points and shared the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] near the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]].

The Swiss team had performed well though, capturing the second and third place in the general classification, winning the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] and having K\u00fcbler win the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]].\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\n[[File:Ferdi K\u00fcbler 1954.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=Black-and-white image of a man in a shirt with a cross.|[[Ferdinand K\u00fcbler]] won the [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] in the 1954 Tour de France.]]\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]]. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}} Of the 110 cyclists that started the 1954 Tour de France, 69 finished the race.\n\nThe [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] was calculated in the same way as in 1953, following the calculation method from the Tours de France from 1905 to 1912. Points were given according to the ranking of the stage: the winner received one points, the next cyclist two points, and so on. These points were added, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the points classification. In 1954, this was won by Ferdinand K\u00fcbler.<ref name=\"mdc1954\"/>\n\nPoints for the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]] were earned by reaching the mountain tops first.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The system was almost the same as in 1953: there were two types of mountain tops: the hardest ones, in category 1, gave 10 points to the first cyclist, the easier ones, in category 2, gave 6 points to the first cyclist, and the easiest ones, in category 3, gave 3 points. Federico Bahamontes won this classification.<ref name=\"mdc1954\"/>\n\nThe [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} It was won by the Swiss team.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=45}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. At the end of the Tour de France, [[Lucien Lazarid\u00e8s]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9]] were leading this classification with equal points and shared the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] near the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]].
