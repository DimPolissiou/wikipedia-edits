Throughout the south of the country, in particular the [[Algarve]], destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, in the lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]]. In [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns of different Portuguese regions, such as [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[Cascais]], and even [[Covilh\u00e3]], which is located near the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range in central inland Portugal, were affected. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilh\u00e3's castle walls and its large towers. On the island of [[Madeira]], [[Funchal]] and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the [[Azores]] archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about 150 m inland. Portuguese towns in northern Africa were also affected by the earthquake, such as [[Ceuta]] and [[El Jadida|Mazagon]], where the tsunami hit hard the coastal fortifications of both towns, in some cases going over it, and flooding the harbor area. In Spain, the tsunamis swept the [[Andalusia]]n Atlantic Coast, nearly destroying the city of [[C\u00e1diz|Cadiz]], killing at least 1/3 of its population.\n\n[[File:Tsunami Forecast Model Animation- Lisbon 1755.webm|thumb|left|2016 animation from [[NOAA]]]]\n[[File:Lisbon 1755 tsunami travel times.jpg|thumb|left|Calculated travel times (in hours) for the tsunami waves of 1 November 1755]]\n\nShocks from the earthquake were felt throughout [[Europe]]<ref>{{citation|jstor=104951|title=An Extraordinary and Surprising Agitation of the Waters, though without Any Perceptible Motion of the Earth, Having Been Observed in Various Parts of This Island, Both Maritime and Inland, on the Same Day, and Chiefly about the Time, That the More Violent Commotions of Both Earth and Waters so Extensively Affected Many Very Distant Parts of the Globe; the Following Accounts, Relating to the Former, Have Been Transmitted to the Society; in Which are Specified the Times and Places when and Where They Happened|journal=  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |series=Series I|volume=49|pages=351\u2013398|last1=Robertson|first1=John|last2=Webb|first2=Philip Carteret|last3=Adee|first3=Swithin|last4=Hodgson|first4=John|author5=Cranbrook|last6=Pringle|first6=John|last7=Mills|first7=Henry|last8=Birch|first8=Thomas|last9=Thomlinson|first9=Mr|last10=Philips|first10=Richard|last11=Crusius|first11=Lewis|last12=Blair|first12=John|last13=Parker|first13=Viscount|last14=Huxham|first14=John|last15=Borlase|first15=William|author16=Swanzey|last17=Arderon|first17=William|last18=Barber|first18=Thomas|last19=Harrison|first19=John|last20=Cowper|first20=Spencer|last21=Gardener|first21=Robert|last22=Colquhoun|first22=James|last23=Nicola|first23=L.|last24=Brocklesby|first24=Richard|author25=HEN TOM|last26=Steplin|first26=Joseph|last27=Hondt|first27=De|last28=Allamond|first28=Mons|year=1755|doi=10.1098/rstl.1755.0059|bibcode=1755RSPT...49..351R}}</ref><ref>''[[Memoirs of Jacques Casanova]]'', Book 2, Ch.

At least 34 looters were hanged in the chaotic aftermath of the disaster.  As a warning against looting, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] ordered [[gallows]] to be constructed in several parts of the city.]]\n\nThe royal family escaped unharmed from the catastrophe: King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] and the court had left the city, after attending mass at sunrise, fulfilling the wish of one of the king's daughters to spend the holiday away from Lisbon. After the catastrophe, Joseph I developed a fear of living within walls, and the court was accommodated in a huge complex of tents and pavilions in the hills of [[Ajuda]], then on the outskirts of Lisbon. The king's [[claustrophobia]] never waned, and it was only after Joseph's death that his daughter [[Maria I of Portugal]] began building the royal [[Ajuda Palace]], which still stands on the site of the old tented camp. Like the king, the prime minister [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal|Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo]] (1st Marquis of Pombal) survived the earthquake. When asked what was to be done, Pombal reportedly replied \"Bury the dead and heal the living\",<ref>{{cite book |author=T. D. Kendrick|title= The Lisbon Earthquake |page=75|author-link= T. D. Kendrick }} Kendrick writes that the remark is apocryphal and is attributed to other sources in anti-Pombal literature.</ref> and set about organizing relief and rehabilitation efforts. Firefighters were sent to extinguish the raging flames, and teams of workers and ordinary citizens were ordered to remove the thousands of corpses before disease could spread. Contrary to custom and against the wishes of the Church, many corpses were loaded onto [[barge]]s and [[burial at sea|buried at sea]] beyond the mouth of the Tagus. To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the [[Portuguese Army]] was deployed and [[gallows]] were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed.<ref>Gunn (2008), p. 77.</ref> The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.\n\nThe [[Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique]] was proposed as the new royal residence in 1760, but the plans were later abandoned due to a lack of priority or interest in a palace being built in the [[Campo de Ourique]] neighborhood of Lisbon.\n\nThe king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first plan was to rebuild the old city using re-cycled materials; this was the cheapest option. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and \"laying out new streets without restraint\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'' pp. 152\u2013155.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaiola pombalina.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[seismology|seismically]] protective wooden structure called \"[[gaiola (construction)|gaiola]] pombalina\" (pombaline cage), developed for the reconstruction of [[Pombaline Lower Town]] ]]\n\nIn less than a year, the city was cleared of debris.

Small wooden models were built for testing, and earthquakes were simulated by marching troops around them. Lisbon's \"new\" Lower Town, known today as the [[Pombaline Lower Town]] (''Baixa Pombalina''), is one of the city's famed attractions. Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] in [[Algarve]], were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.\n\nThe [[Casa Pia]], a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as ''A Pia'', \"Maria the Pious\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\n==Effect on society, economy and philosophy==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nThe earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia. The earthquake had struck on an important religious holiday and had destroyed almost every important church in the city, causing anxiety and confusion amongst the citizens of a staunch and devout [[Roman Catholic]] country. Theologians and philosophers focused and speculated on the religious cause and message, seeing the earthquake as a manifestation of [[divine judgment]].<ref name=\"Kendrick\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/lisbonearthquake010555mbp/lisbonearthquake010555mbp_djvu.txt | title=The Lisbon Earthquake | accessdate=7 May 2014| publisher=J.B.

Voltaire's ''Candide'' attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, \"[[the best of all possible worlds]]\", a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity.  The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote, \"[t]he earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]\" (''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' 361).  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.<ref name=\"Csmonitor.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/1028/Japan-tsunami-is-small-compared-to-five-of-world-s-biggest-tsunamis/1755-Lisbon-tsunami | title=Japan tsunami is small compared to five of world's biggest tsunamis | journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=28 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] published three separate texts on the Lisbon earthquake.<ref>See:\n* Kant, I.

Kant's theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, was incorrect, but was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. According to [[Walter Benjamin]], Kant's slim early book on the earthquake \"probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology\".\n\n[[Werner Hamacher]] has claimed that the earthquake's consequences extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm \"grounding\" for philosophers' arguments shaky and uncertain: \"Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech\" (263).

The prime minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], was the favorite of the king, but the [[Portuguese nobility|aristocracy]] despised him as an upstart son of a country squire. The prime minister, in turn, disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755 there was a constant struggle for power and royal favor, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king in 1758 and the subsequent elimination of the powerful [[Duke of Aveiro]] and the [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]].{{clarify|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Development of seismology==\n{{Main|Parochial Memories of 1758}}\nThe prime minister's response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction.

Questions included:\n* At what time did the earthquake begin, and how long did the earthquake last?\n* Did you perceive the shock to be greater from one direction than another? Example, from north to south? Did buildings seem to fall more to one side than the other?\n* How many people died and were any of them distinguished?\n* Did the sea rise or fall first, and how many [[Hand (unit)|hands]] did it rise above the normal?\n* If fire broke out, how long did it last and what damage did it cause?<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'', pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe answers to these and other questions are still archived in the [[Torre do Tombo]], the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests' accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], this would have been impossible. Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.{{by whom|date=October 2019}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nA fictionalized version of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake features as a main plot element of the 2014 [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]'', developed and published by [[Ubisoft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=5 August 2014|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> Notably, a similar earthquake occurs earlier in the story in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and possibly coincides with a real-world earthquake recorded there in [[List of earthquakes in Haiti|1751]].<ref>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1|author=NGDC|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1972|type=Data Set}}</ref>\n\nThe album [[1755 (album)|1755]] by the Portuguese [[Gothic metal|Gothic Metal]] band [[Moonspell]] is a concept album detailing the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Throughout the south of the country, in particular the [[Algarve]], destruction was rampant. The tsunami destroyed some coastal fortresses in the Algarve and, in the lower levels, it razed several houses. Almost all the coastal towns and villages of the Algarve were heavily damaged, except [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]], which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]]. In [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], the waves reached the top of the city walls. Other towns of different Portuguese regions, such as [[Peniche, Portugal|Peniche]], [[Cascais]], and even [[Covilh\u00e3]], which is located near the [[Serra da Estrela]] mountain range in central inland Portugal, were affected. The shock waves of the earthquake destroyed part of Covilh\u00e3's castle walls and its large towers. On the island of [[Madeira]], [[Funchal]] and many smaller settlements suffered significant damage. Almost all of the ports in the [[Azores]] archipelago suffered most of their destruction from the tsunami, with the sea penetrating about 150 m inland. Portuguese towns in northern Africa were also affected by the earthquake, such as [[Ceuta]] and [[El Jadida|Mazagon]], where the tsunami hit hard the coastal fortifications of both towns, in some cases going over it, and flooding the harbor area. In Spain, the tsunamis swept the [[Andalusia]]n Atlantic Coast, nearly destroying the city of [[C\u00e1diz|Cadiz]], killing at least 1/3 of its population.\n\n[[File:Tsunami Forecast Model Animation- Lisbon 1755.webm|thumb|left|2016 animation from [[NOAA]]]]\n[[File:Lisbon 1755 tsunami travel times.jpg|thumb|left|Calculated travel times (in hours) for the tsunami waves of 1 November 1755]]\n\nShocks from the earthquake were felt throughout [[Europe]]<ref>{{citation|jstor=104951|title=An Extraordinary and Surprising Agitation of the Waters, though without Any Perceptible Motion of the Earth, Having Been Observed in Various Parts of This Island, Both Maritime and Inland, on the Same Day, and Chiefly about the Time, That the More Violent Commotions of Both Earth and Waters so Extensively Affected Many Very Distant Parts of the Globe; the Following Accounts, Relating to the Former, Have Been Transmitted to the Society; in Which are Specified the Times and Places when and Where They Happened|journal=  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |series=Series I|volume=49|pages=351\u2013398|last1=Robertson|first1=John|last2=Webb|first2=Philip Carteret|last3=Adee|first3=Swithin|last4=Hodgson|first4=John|author5=Cranbrook|last6=Pringle|first6=John|last7=Mills|first7=Henry|last8=Birch|first8=Thomas|last9=Thomlinson|first9=Mr|last10=Philips|first10=Richard|last11=Crusius|first11=Lewis|last12=Blair|first12=John|last13=Parker|first13=Viscount|last14=Huxham|first14=John|last15=Borlase|first15=William|author16=Swanzey|last17=Arderon|first17=William|last18=Barber|first18=Thomas|last19=Harrison|first19=John|last20=Cowper|first20=Spencer|last21=Gardener|first21=Robert|last22=Colquhoun|first22=James|last23=Nicola|first23=L.|last24=Brocklesby|first24=Richard|author25=HEN TOM|last26=Steplin|first26=Joseph|last27=Hondt|first27=De|last28=Allamond|first28=Mons|year=1755|doi=10.1098/rstl.1755.0059|bibcode=1755RSPT...49..351R}}</ref><ref>''[[Memoirs of Jacques Casanova]]'', Book 2, Ch.

To prevent disorder in the ruined city, the [[Portuguese Army]] was deployed and [[gallows]] were constructed at high points around the city to deter looters; more than thirty people were publicly executed.<ref>Gunn (2008), p. 77.</ref> The army prevented many able-bodied citizens from fleeing, pressing them into relief and reconstruction work.\n\nThe [[Project for the Royal Palace in Campo de Ourique]] was proposed as the new royal residence in 1760, but the plans were later abandoned due to a lack of priority or interest in a palace being built in the [[Campo de Ourique]] neighborhood of Lisbon.\n\nThe king and the prime minister immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. On 4 December 1755, little more than a month after the earthquake, Manuel da Maia, chief engineer to the realm, presented his plans for the re-building of Lisbon. Maia presented four options from abandoning Lisbon to building a completely new city. The first plan was to rebuild the old city using re-cycled materials; this was the cheapest option. The second and third plans proposed widening certain streets. The fourth option boldly proposed razing the entire Baixa quarter and \"laying out new streets without restraint\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'' pp. 152\u2013155.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaiola pombalina.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[seismology|seismically]] protective wooden structure called \"[[gaiola (construction)|gaiola]] pombalina\" (pombaline cage), developed for the reconstruction of [[Pombaline Lower Town]] ]]\n\nIn less than a year, the city was cleared of debris. Keen to have a new and perfectly ordered city, the king commissioned the construction of big squares, rectilinear, large avenues and widened streets&nbsp;\u2013 the new ''mottos'' of Lisbon.\n\nThe [[Pombaline style|Pombaline]] buildings are among the earliest [[seismology|seismically]] protected constructions in Europe. Small wooden models were built for testing, and earthquakes were simulated by marching troops around them. Lisbon's \"new\" Lower Town, known today as the [[Pombaline Lower Town]] (''Baixa Pombalina''), is one of the city's famed attractions. Sections of other Portuguese cities, such as the [[Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio Municipality|Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio]] in [[Algarve]], were also rebuilt along Pombaline principles.\n\nThe [[Casa Pia]], a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I (known as ''A Pia'', \"Maria the Pious\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, was founded following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\n\n==Effect on society, economy and philosophy==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}\nThe earthquake had wide-ranging effects on the lives of the populace and intelligentsia. The earthquake had struck on an important religious holiday and had destroyed almost every important church in the city, causing anxiety and confusion amongst the citizens of a staunch and devout [[Roman Catholic]] country. Theologians and philosophers focused and speculated on the religious cause and message, seeing the earthquake as a manifestation of [[divine judgment]].<ref name=\"Kendrick\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/lisbonearthquake010555mbp/lisbonearthquake010555mbp_djvu.txt | title=The Lisbon Earthquake | accessdate=7 May 2014| publisher=J.B.

The noted writer-philosopher [[Voltaire]] used the earthquake in ''[[Candide]]'' and in his ''[[Po\u00e8me sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne]]'' (\"Poem on the Lisbon disaster\"). Voltaire's ''Candide'' attacks the notion that all is for the best in this, \"[[the best of all possible worlds]]\", a world closely supervised by a benevolent deity.  The Lisbon disaster provided a counterexample. As [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote, \"[t]he earthquake of Lisbon sufficed to cure Voltaire of the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]\" (''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' 361).  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was also influenced by the devastation following the earthquake, whose severity he believed was due to too many people living within the close quarters of the city. Rousseau used the earthquake as an argument against cities as part of his desire for a more naturalistic way of life.<ref name=\"Csmonitor.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Global-Issues/2010/1028/Japan-tsunami-is-small-compared-to-five-of-world-s-biggest-tsunamis/1755-Lisbon-tsunami | title=Japan tsunami is small compared to five of world's biggest tsunamis | journal=Christian Science Monitor| date=28 October 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] published three separate texts on the Lisbon earthquake.<ref>See:\n* Kant, I.

Kant's theory, which involved shifts in huge caverns filled with hot gases, was incorrect, but was one of the first systematic attempts to explain earthquakes in natural rather than supernatural terms. According to [[Walter Benjamin]], Kant's slim early book on the earthquake \"probably represents the beginnings of scientific geography in Germany. And certainly the beginnings of seismology\".\n\n[[Werner Hamacher]] has claimed that the earthquake's consequences extended into the vocabulary of philosophy, making the common metaphor of firm \"grounding\" for philosophers' arguments shaky and uncertain: \"Under the impression exerted by the Lisbon earthquake, which touched the European mind in one [of] its more sensitive epochs, the metaphor of ground and tremor completely lost their apparent innocence; they were no longer merely figures of speech\" (263).  Hamacher claims that the foundational certainty of [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' philosophy began to shake following the Lisbon earthquake.\n\n=== Politics ===\n[[File:Retrato do Marqu\u00eas de Pombal - escola portuguesa, s\u00e9c. XVIII.png|thumb|[[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]]]]\nThe earthquake had a major impact on politics. The prime minister, [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal]], was the favorite of the king, but the [[Portuguese nobility|aristocracy]] despised him as an upstart son of a country squire. The prime minister, in turn, disliked the old nobles, whom he considered corrupt and incapable of practical action. Before 1 November 1755 there was a constant struggle for power and royal favor, but the competent response of the Marquis of Pombal effectively severed the power of the old aristocratic factions. However, silent opposition and resentment of King Joseph I began to rise, which would culminate with the attempted assassination of the king in 1758 and the subsequent elimination of the powerful [[Duke of Aveiro]] and the [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]].{{clarify|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Development of seismology==\n{{Main|Parochial Memories of 1758}}\nThe prime minister's response was not limited to the practicalities of reconstruction. He ordered a query sent to all [[parish]]es of the country regarding the earthquake and its effects. Questions included:\n* At what time did the earthquake begin, and how long did the earthquake last?\n* Did you perceive the shock to be greater from one direction than another? Example, from north to south? Did buildings seem to fall more to one side than the other?\n* How many people died and were any of them distinguished?\n* Did the sea rise or fall first, and how many [[Hand (unit)|hands]] did it rise above the normal?\n* If fire broke out, how long did it last and what damage did it cause?<ref>Shrady, ''The Last Day'', pp.145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe answers to these and other questions are still archived in the [[Torre do Tombo]], the national historical archive. Studying and cross-referencing the priests' accounts, modern scientists were able to reconstruct the event from a scientific perspective. Without the questionnaire designed by the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquess of Pombal|Marquis of Pombal]], this would have been impossible. Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.{{by whom|date=October 2019}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nA fictionalized version of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake features as a main plot element of the 2014 [[video game]] ''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]'', developed and published by [[Ubisoft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft - here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|date=5 August 2014|website=Polygon|language=en|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> Notably, a similar earthquake occurs earlier in the story in [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Haiti]], and possibly coincides with a real-world earthquake recorded there in [[List of earthquakes in Haiti|1751]].<ref>{{citation|title=Significant Earthquake Database|url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&s=1&d=1|author=NGDC|publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]|doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K|year=1972|type=Data Set}}</ref>\n\nThe album [[1755 (album)|1755]] by the Portuguese [[Gothic metal|Gothic Metal]] band [[Moonspell]] is a concept album detailing the story of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

Until then, during his coaching career, it became notorious that he would hire stricktly domestix players and release as many as foreign ones as he could. One of the reasons is clearly his lack of knolledge of foreign langueges, knowing only Serbian and Russian, thus being unable to communicate with players speaking other languages. Confronted with the issue during the inteview, he made an effort to put the blame on the foreign players, accusing them of indiscipline due to the fact that salaries were being receved late, however, curiously, all other coaches face same problems but still don\u00b4t have any conflicts with foreign players, unlike Lalatovic has, so seems clearly more as a cheap excuse. He follows to claim that has nothing against foreign players, it\u00b4s just that they \"need to be much more better then a domestic player\" in order for him to respect them equally as he does domestic ones.<ref>[https://www.fkvojvodina.rs/nenad-lalatovic-odgovarao-na-pitanja-vojvodinasa/?script=lat Nenad Lalatovi\u0107 odgovarao na pitanja vojvodina\u0161a] at fkvojvodina.rs, 10-7-2019,

Until then, during his coaching career, it became notorious that he would hire stricktly domestix players and release as many as foreign ones as he could. One of the reasons is clearly his lack of knolledge of foreign langueges, knowing only Serbian and Russian, thus being unable to communicate with players speaking other languages. Confronted with the issue during the inteview, he made an effort to put the blame on the foreign players, accusing them of indiscipline due to the fact that salaries were being receved late, however, curiously, all other coaches face same problems but still don\u00b4t have any conflicts with foreign players, unlike Lalatovic has, so seems clearly more as a cheap excuse. He follows to claim that has nothing against foreign players, it\u00b4s just that they \"need to be much more better then a domestic player\" in order for him to respect him equally as a domestic one.<ref>[https://www.fkvojvodina.rs/nenad-lalatovic-odgovarao-na-pitanja-vojvodinasa/?script=lat Nenad Lalatovi\u0107 odgovarao na pitanja vojvodina\u0161a] at fkvojvodina.rs, 10-7-2019, retrieved
