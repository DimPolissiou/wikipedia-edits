It is also used by [[Presbyterians]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], [[Methodists]] and [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]].\n\nThe Apostles' Creed is [[Trinity|trinitarian]] in structure with sections affirming belief in [[God the wanker]], [[God the Son]], and [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|God the Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bayes|first=Jonathan F.|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y5FMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=The+Apostles'+Creed+is+trinitarian+in+structure+with+sections+affirming+belief+in+God+the+Father,+God+the+Son+and+God+the+Holy+Spirit&source=bl&ots=LlEdVomgjC&sig=ACfU3U3ABZnPJmgUlY96f5f0SBV_Ak9Zgg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwih9Puj0qnoAhXJMMAKHcB1BjoQ6AEwDXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Apostles'%20Creed%20is%20trinitarian%20in%20structure%20with%20sections%20affirming%20belief%20in%20God%20the%20Father,%20God%20the%20Son%20and%20God%20the%20Holy%20Spirit&f=false|title=The Apostles' Creed: Truth with Passion|date=2010-09-09|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-60899-539-4|language=en}}</ref> The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the [[canonical gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]]. It thus says nothing explicitly about the [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]] of either [[Jesus]] or the Holy Spirit. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.\n\nThe earliest known mention of the expression \"Apostles' Creed\" occurs in a letter of AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. #738.</ref>\n\nHowever, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase \"he descended into hell\" in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  <ref>Wesley, John (1784). \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,\" p. 12.</ref> It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. \n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' of 1989 also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use.

In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, \"Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is also used in an interrogative form at the [[Easter Vigil]] in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<ref>''The Book of Common Prayer'' (1979).

Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the [[Old Roman Symbol]].\n\nBecause of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some [[Christology|Christological]] issues defined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and other [[List of Christian creeds|Christian creeds]].

AD&nbsp;390 from a [[Synod of Milan|synod in Milan]] and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, each of the [[Twelve Apostles]] contributed an article to the twelve articles of the creed.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gqrEpBuBGIgC&pg=PA63 | first = Jack | last = Rogers | title =

In the fourth line, it replaced the personal pronoun \"he\" with the relative \"who\", and changed the punctuation, so as no longer to present the Creed as a series of separate statements. In the same line it removed the words \"the power of\".

The version which is most often used is located at No. 881 in the ''[[United Methodist Hymnal]]'', one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers [[John Wesley]] and [[Charles Wesley]], founders of [[Methodism]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093223/http://catalystresources.org/issues/272yee.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |title= Contemporary Evangelical Perspectives |publisher= Catalyst resources |accessdate= May 19, 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518093227/http://catalystresources.org/issues/312knight.html |archivedate= May 18, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref> It is notable for omitting the line \"he descended into hell\", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version.

Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. p. 512.</ref> ''The Methodist Hymnal'' of 1966 has the same version of the creed, but with a note at the bottom of the page stating, \"Traditional use of this creed includes these words: 'He descended into hell.'\"<ref>''The United Methodist Hymnal'' (1966). Nashville: The Methodist Publishing House. #738.</ref>\n\nHowever, when the Methodist Episcopal Church was organized in the United States in 1784, John Wesley sent the new American Church a Sunday Service which included the phrase \"he descended into hell\" in the text of The Apostles' Creed.  <ref>Wesley, John (1784). \"The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America with other Occasional Services,\" p. 12.</ref> It is clear that Wesley intended American Methodists to use the phrase in the recitation of the Creed. \n\nThe ''United Methodist Hymnal'' of 1989 also contains (at #882) what it terms the \"Ecumenical Version\" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987).<ref>{{Citation | chapter = The Worship Resources | title = United Methodist Hymnal | editor-first = Hoyt | editor-last = Hickman | year = 1989 | page = 200}}.</ref> This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in ''The United Methodist Book of Worship'', and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word \"catholic\" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.\n\n:I believe in God the Father Almighty,\n::maker of heaven and earth;\n\n:And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, \n::who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, \n::born of the Virgin Mary, \n::suffered under Pontius Pilate, \n::was crucified, died, and was buried;\n::he descended to the dead.\n::On the third day he rose again; \n::he ascended into heaven, \n::is seated at the right hand of the Father, \n::and will come again to judge the living and the dead.\n\n:I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n::the holy catholic church,\n::the communion of saints,\n::the forgiveness of sins,\n::the resurrection of the body \n::and the life everlasting. Amen.<ref>The United Methodist Hymnal Book of United Methodist Worship \u00a91989 The United Methodist Publishing House</ref>\n\n==Liturgical use in Western Christianity==\nThe Apostles' Creed is used in its direct form or in interrogative forms by Western Christian communities in several of their [[liturgy|liturgical]] rites, in particular those of [[baptism]] and the [[Eucharist]].\n\n=== Rite of Baptism ===\nThe Apostles' Creed, whose present form is similar to the baptismal creed used in Rome in the third and fourth centuries, actually developed from questions addressed to those seeking baptism.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apostles-Creed ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': \"Apostles' Creed\"]</ref> The Catholic Church still today uses an interrogative form of it in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). In the official English translation ([[International Commission on English in the Liturgy|ICEL]], 1974) the minister of baptism asks:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting?\n\nTo each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers \"I do.\" Then the celebrant says:\n:This is our faith. This is the faith of the Church. We are proud to profess it, in Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAnd all respond: Amen.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand]] uses the Apostles' Creed in its baptism rite in spite of the reservations of some of its members regarding the phrase \"born of the virgin Mary\".<ref>[https://knoxchurch.net/2015/09/30/why-use-the-apostles-creed-in-a-baptism/ Knox Church Dunedin: \"Why use the Apostles\u2019 Creed in a baptism?\"]</ref>\n\nThe [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] uses the Apostles' Creed as part of a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. The Apostles' Creed is recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant's question, \"Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Holy Baptism,\" The (Online) Book of Common Prayer|date=1979|publisher=The Episcopal Church|edition=revised 2007|url=https://www.bcponline.org/Baptism/holybaptism.html|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is also used in an interrogative form at the [[Easter Vigil]] in The Renewal of Baptismal Vows.<ref>''The Book of Common Prayer'' (1979). New York: Church Publishing. pp. 292-293.</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of England]] likewise asks the candidates, sponsors and congregation to recite the Apostles' Creed in answer to similar interrogations, in which it avoids using the word \"God\" of the Son and the Holy Spirit, asking instead: \"Do you believe and trust in his Son Jesus Christ?\", and \"Do you believe and trust in the Holy Spirit?\" Moreover, \"where there are strong pastoral reasons\", it allows use of an alternative formula in which the interrogations, while speaking of \"God the Son\" and \"God the Holy Spirit\", are more elaborate but are not based on the Apostles' Creed, and the response in each case is: \"I believe and trust in him.\"<ref>[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/common-worship/christian-initiation/baptism-and-confirmation ''Common Worship'': \"Holy Baptism\"]</ref> The ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' may also be used, which in its rite of baptism has the minister recite the Apostles' Creed in interrogative form. asking the godparents or, in the case \"of such as are of Riper Years\", the candidate: \"Dost thou believe in God the Father ...\" The response is: \"All this I stedfastly believe.\"<ref>''Book of Common Prayer'': \"[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/public-baptism-infants The Ministration of Public Baptism to Infants]\"; \"[https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/worship-texts-and-resources/book-common-prayer/public-baptism-such-are-riper The Order of Baptism for those of Riper Years]\"</ref>\n\n[[Lutheran]]s following the ''[[Lutheran Service Book]]'' ([[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] and the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Canada]]), like Catholics and Anglicans, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:\n:Do you believe in God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth?\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He will come to judge the living and the dead?\n:Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting?\n\nFollowing each question, the candidate answers: \"Yes, I believe\".

For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.\n:Do you believe in God?\n:I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.\n:Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\n:I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried; he descended to the dead.

Shankar]] and produced by [[K. T. Kunjumon]]. The film stars [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nagma]], while [[Raghuvaran]], [[Girish Karnad]] and [[Vadivelu]] play other pivotal roles. It focuses on a college student who falls in love with the [[List of governors of Tamil Nadu|state governor]]'s daughter. The governor opposes this, and unknown to anyone, plans on toppling the state government.\n\n''Kadhalan'' was released on 1 September 1994. The film was a commercial success and won many recognitions and honours, including two [[Filmfare Awards South|South Filmfare Awards]], and four [[National Film Awards]]. The film was released in Telugu with the title ''Premikudu'' and in Hindi as ''Humse Hai Muqabala.''\n\n== Plot ==\nPrabhu is the student chairman of the Government Arts College, [[Chennai|Madras]] and his best friend Vasanth is the joint secretary. He goes to invite [[List of governors of Tamil Nadu|governor]] Karkala Sathyanarayana as the chief guest for the college annual day along with Vasanth, during which he sees his daughter Shruti and instantly falls in love with her. Karkala accepts the invitation and on the function day he arrives with his wife and Shruti; Prabhu is excited to see her again.\n\nTo get close to Shruti, Prabhu joins her dance school. Shruti initially hates him for disrespecting classical dance. Prabhu's brother, police constable Kathiresan, advises him to impress her by learning classical dance properly and Prabhu assents. Unknown to anyone, Karkala intends to topple the state government by planting bombs in the state; a recent bomb blast at a wholesale market inaugurated by Karkala was actually orchestrated by him.\n\nShruti refuses to go to the [[Natyanjali]] festival at [[Chidambaram]] if Prabhu attends, for fear of him insulting the art. To disprove her, Prabhu secretly enters her house and demonstrates his dance skills to her. She is amazed and agree to go but, due to fear of terrorism, Karkala refuses to let her leave. She escapes with Prabhu and Vasanth via motorbike, outwitting her bodyguards.\n\nMeanwhile, Karkala and bomb specialist Mallikarjuna \"Malli\" plan the next bomb blast at the [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja Temple]] where Natyanjali is to take place. Commander Ajay informs Karkala that Shruti left with two men to attend Natyanjali. Karkala orders Malli to remove the bomb. Prabhu and Shruti are chased by the police and Malli; that night they stay in a paddy field. Shruti realises Prabhu's love for her and reciprocates. They reach Chidambaram as planned. Due to Malli's inability to remove the bomb, Karkala sends Ajay and a police squad to the temple. Ajay and the squad reach the temple, remove the bomb and bring Shruti back.\n\nKarkala doubts Shruti's virginity as she was with Prabhu for a night. Upset at this, Shruti meets with Prabhu and asks him to marry her, but then Ajay and his commandos imprison Prabhu and accuse him of planting the bomb. The police order Prabhu to confess, but he refuses while Shruti becomes embittered over his imprisonment, and expresses her love for him to her parents. Vasanth informs all the students about the happenings and a strike is called by all the students against Karkala. Prabhu's release is ordered by Karkala after Shruti's requesting.\n\nShruti is sent to her paternal grandparents' house in Andhra Pradesh. Prabhu and Vasanth reach the village and find her. Shruti's grandparents support their romance and unite them. Malli sees Prabhu and informs Karkala over a wireless transmission which Prabhu overhears. He discovers evidence of Karkala's attempts to blast Nataraja Temple, and learns of his plans of blasting the [[Government General Hospital, Chennai|Government General Hospital]]. After subduing Malli, Prabhu and Vasanth escape with the evidence.\n\nMalli informs Karkala, who orders the police to find Prabhu. Police arrest Prabhu and Vasanth, and Karkala tells Malli to make the bomb detonate after his visit to the hospital to see the Vice President undergoing treatment there. They plan to dump Prabhu and Vasanth in the hospital. However, Prabhu and Vasanth escape, and Prabhu informs Kathiresan about the bomb. Malli plants the bomb, but Karkala betrays him by trying to kill him with a bomb radio. Malli survives, and in revenge re-times the bomb to detonate during Karkala's scheduled visit.\n\nPrabhu searches for the bomb, while Vasanth brings students to vacate the patients. After meeting the Vice President, Karkala gets stuck in a lift with his wife and daughter. Shruti is helped out, while Prabhu, having located the bomb, runs to a river and throws it there; the bomb detonates without killing anyone. Malli manages to kill Karkala with a live wire, but himself dies. Prabhu and Shruti reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Prabhu Deva]] as Prabhu\n* [[Nagma]] as Shruthi\n* [[Vadivelu]] as Vasanth\n* [[Raghuvaran]] as Mallikarjuna \"Malli\"\n* [[Girish Karnad]] as Kakarla Sathyanarayana\n* [[S.

Shankar]] and produced by [[K. T. Kunjumon]]. The film stars [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nagma]], while [[Raghuvaran]], [[Girish Karnad]] and [[Vadivelu]] play other pivotal roles. It focuses on a college student who falls in love with the [[List of governors of Tamil Nadu|state governor]]'s daughter. The governor opposes this, and unknown to anyone, plans on toppling the state government.\n\n''Kadhalan'' was released on 1 September 1994. The film was a commercial success and won many recognitions and honours, including two [[Filmfare Awards South|South Filmfare Awards]], and four [[National Film Awards]]. The film was released in Telugu with the title ''Premikudu'' and in Hindi as ''Humse Hai Muqabala.''\n\n== Plot ==\nPrabhu is the student chairman of the Government Arts College, [[Chennai|Madras]] and his best friend Vasanth is the joint secretary. He goes to invite [[List of governors of Tamil Nadu|governor]] Karkala Sathyanarayana as the chief guest for the college annual day along with Vasanth, during which he sees his daughter Shruti and instantly falls in love with her. Karkala accepts the invitation and on the function day he arrives with his wife and Shruti; Prabhu is excited to see her again.\n\nTo get close to Shruti, Prabhu joins her dance school. Shruti initially hates him for disrespecting classical dance. Prabhu's father, police constable Kathiresan, advises him to impress her by learning classical dance properly and Prabhu assents. Unknown to anyone, Karkala intends to topple the state government by planting bombs in the state; a recent bomb blast at a wholesale market inaugurated by Karkala was actually orchestrated by him.\n\nShruti refuses to go to the [[Natyanjali]] festival at [[Chidambaram]] if Prabhu attends, for fear of him insulting the art. To disprove her, Prabhu secretly enters her house and demonstrates his dance skills to her. She is amazed and agree to go but, due to fear of terrorism, Karkala refuses to let her leave. She escapes with Prabhu and Vasanth via motorbike, outwitting her bodyguards.\n\nMeanwhile, Karkala and bomb specialist Mallikarjuna \"Malli\" plan the next bomb blast at the [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja Temple]] where Natyanjali is to take place. Commander Ajay informs Karkala that Shruti left with two men to attend Natyanjali. Karkala orders Malli to remove the bomb. Prabhu and Shruti are chased by the police and Malli; that night they stay in a paddy field. Shruti realises Prabhu's love for her and reciprocates. They reach Chidambaram as planned. Due to Malli's inability to remove the bomb, Karkala sends Ajay and a police squad to the temple. Ajay and the squad reach the temple, remove the bomb and bring Shruti back.\n\nKarkala doubts Shruti's virginity as she was with Prabhu for a night. Upset at this, Shruti meets with Prabhu and asks him to marry her, but then Ajay and his commandos imprison Prabhu and accuse him of planting the bomb. The police order Prabhu to confess, but he refuses while Shruti becomes embittered over his imprisonment, and expresses her love for him to her parents. Vasanth informs all the students about the happenings and a strike is called by all the students against Karkala. Prabhu's release is ordered by Karkala after Shruti's requesting.\n\nShruti is sent to her paternal grandparents' house in Andhra Pradesh. Prabhu and Vasanth reach the village and find her. Shruti's grandparents support their romance and unite them. Malli sees Prabhu and informs Karkala over a wireless transmission which Prabhu overhears. He discovers evidence of Karkala's attempts to blast Nataraja Temple, and learns of his plans of blasting the [[Government General Hospital, Chennai|Government General Hospital]]. After subduing Malli, Prabhu and Vasanth escape with the evidence.\n\nMalli informs Karkala, who orders the police to find Prabhu. Police arrest Prabhu and Vasanth, and Karkala tells Malli to make the bomb detonate after his visit to the hospital to see the Vice President undergoing treatment there. They plan to dump Prabhu and Vasanth in the hospital. However, Prabhu and Vasanth escape, and Prabhu informs Kathiresan about the bomb. Malli plants the bomb, but Karkala betrays him by trying to kill him with a bomb radio. Malli survives, and in revenge re-times the bomb to detonate during Karkala's scheduled visit.\n\nPrabhu searches for the bomb, while Vasanth brings students to vacate the patients. After meeting the Vice President, Karkala gets stuck in a lift with his wife and daughter. Shruti is helped out, while Prabhu, having located the bomb, runs to a river and throws it there; the bomb detonates without killing anyone. Malli manages to kill Karkala with a live wire, but himself dies. Prabhu and Shruti reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Prabhu Deva]] as Prabhu\n* [[Nagma]] as Shruthi\n* [[Vadivelu]] as Vasanth\n* [[Raghuvaran]] as Mallikarjuna \"Malli\"\n* [[Girish Karnad]] as Kakarla Sathyanarayana\n* [[S.
