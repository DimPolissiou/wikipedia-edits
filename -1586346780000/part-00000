Rajeshwar then meets a girl from a poor family, Bharati, who happens to be his school teacher's daughter and falls in love with her. Bharati's father is Vishnupratap, a schoolteacher, who is really unhappy, for he is unable to earn enough money to feed his family and provide them with basic amenities. He and other teachers work in the school managed by Dharamraj. The fund management headed by Dhanraj has been for years without giving any hike in fees to teachers making them work. When Rajeshwar comes to know of this, he starts confronting each lie of the partners. Bharati has a neighbor, Tilak, who is unemployed, and lives with his mother, Sharda, who works as a maidservant in Dhanraj's house. Later he gets the job of a manager in Dharamraj industries and starts  obstructing nearly all the criminal activities carried out by the three partners. Rajeshwar gets impressed with the sincerity of Tilak. Meanwhile, Tilak falls in love with the Dhanraj's daughter, Rani. Dharamraj accidentally meets Sharda and he realizes that Tilak is his long-lost nephew. Dharamraj tells Rajeshwar the history of his family and how Tilak is related to him. Then Dharamraj is killed, and the evidence points towards Tilak and he has to gather evidence to prove his innocence.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rajesh Khanna]] as Rajeshwar\n*[[Jeetendra]] as Tilak \n*[[Jayaprada]] as Rani\n*[[Sridevi]] as Bharati\n*[[Shatrughan Sinha]] as Satyajit\n*[[Waheeda Rehman]] as Sharda\n*[[Prem Chopra]] as Dhanraj\n*[[Kader Khan]] as Naaglingam Reddy\n*[[Shakti Kapoor]] as Naagpal\n*[[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] as Birju\n*[[Asrani]] as Bhagwan Das\n*[[Ranjeet]] as Naagendra\n*[[Om Shivpuri]] as Dharamraj\n*[[Shreeram Lagoo]] as Master Vishnupratap \n*[[Iftekhar]] as Doctor\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n{| border=\"10\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! # !!

Rajeshwar then meets a girl from a poor family, Bharati, who happens to be his school teacher's daughter and falls in love with her. Bharati's father is Vishnupratap, a schoolteacher, who is really unhappy, for he is unable to earn enough money to feed his family and provide them with basic amenities. He and other teachers work in the school managed by Dharamraj. The fund management headed by Dhanraj has been for years without giving any hike in fees to teachers making them work. When Rajeshwar comes to know of this, he starts confronting each lie of the partners. Bharati has a neighbor, Tilak, who is unemployed, and lives with his mother, Sharda, who works as a maidservant in Dhanraj's house. Later he gets the job of a manager in Dharamraj industries and starts  obstructing nearly all the criminal activities carried out by the three partners.

Business tycoon [[Ratan Tata]] entered [[Bollywood]] by producing ''Aetbaar''.<ref>http://way2online.com/?p=136039</ref> \n''Aetbaar'' is inspired by the Hollywood film ''[[Fear (1996 film)|Fear]]''. Vikram Bhatt had earlier directed another movie based on the Hollywood film ''[[Fear (1996 film)|Fear]]'', called ''[[Inteha (2003 film)|Inteha]]'', which had released just 3 months earlier.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2015}}\nEver since his son died in a car accident fifteen years ago, Dr. Ranveer ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) has been very protective of his daughter Ria ([[Bipasha Basu]]). While walking home on a rainy night from college, Ria gets frightened as a gang of motorcyclists zoom by her, making her drop her umbrella. She yells at them until they stop feet away and when one of the men ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) removes his helmet and walks over to Ria, helping her pick up her wet notebooks.\n\nOn another day Ria and her friends go to a club and the man who had helped Ria approaches her while at the bar. She is surprised to meet him again and is stunned when he tells her that he has been thinking about her ever since that rainy night. He forces her to dance, and there she feels something for him then but she does not want to admit it. Dr. Ranveer shows up asking for Ria. The man introduces himself as Aryan before she leaves. Dr. Ranveer wants to take Ria home. Aryan goes with his friends to a brothel where a prostitute named Saira teases Aryan and angers him when she asks him to sleep with her to which he refuses. He takes her in a dark room where she thinks they are going to have sex, but Aryan brutally beats her up. Dr. Ranveer is called to the hospital to treat her.\n\nThe next morning, Aryan walks into Ria's class and takes her to his place where he shows her a portrait he made of her the first night they met. When she tells him it's beautiful, more beautiful than her, he lights it on fire and tells her that there's nothing in the world that is better than her. She runs out of his apartment terrified, but realizes that she's fallen in love with him. They begin to spend time together and he asks her if they can meet the next day. Ria walks into her house joyous and totally in love where she learns that her parents have planned a surprise vacation to a cabin they rented for four days. Ria tells her parents that she does not want to miss out on any school, but they assure her she will not. They go to the cabin and Ria thinks about Aryan, who is at his house looking gradually at the clock as hours pass by waiting for Ria. He then smashes his clock in rage. Ria cleans around the cabin and looks out the window to see Aryan. She rushes outside to look for him but does not see him.  Dr. Ranveer spots them together. He takes Ria home and tells her to call him over for tea. She is thrilled and when Aryan comes over, he makes a good impression on her mother ([[Supriya Pilgaonkar]]) but not her father and Aryan tells Ria that he sensed that. Dr. Ranveer tells his wife that he's seen Aryan somewhere before and that it is something disturbing.\n\nAryan tries to steal a car with his friends so that they can sell it for money. But one of his friends gets injured in the process. They take him to the hospital. Dr. Ranveer tells the prostitute Saira that her wounds will heal eventually and then she spots  Aryan, who is stunned to see Dr. Ranveer treating Saira, but he does not see Aryan. Saira tries to tell Dr. Ranveer that Aryan beat her, but Dr. Ranveer does not see Aryan's face.\n\nOne day while trying to find a colleague's phone number, Dr. Ranveer finds an old article about Aryan saying that he killed his own father and he shows Ria and his wife. Ria confronts Aryan about this, and he tells her that he did kill his father for the sake of his mother because his father was drunk and he would beat his mother everyday and one day from college he finds out that his mother had died. So he burnt his father alive. Ria then apologizes and they make up. She tries to explain to her father, but he refuses to believe Aryan's innocence, pointing that he was still a killer. Ria then yells at her father saying that he's so over-protective just because his son died, and that he's making everyone miserable and Ria's mother slaps her and Ria tells them that she hates them.\n\nDr. Ranveer decides to dig deeper and finds out that Aryan's mother is alive and the reason Aryan killed his father was because Aryan was in love with his college teacher named Sanjana. She was leaving the city and getting married when Aryan goes to her house and tries to kill. His father intervenes with the police and Aryan is locked up in his room. Sanjana stops by his house to thank his father and she leaves, and Aryan snaps. The parents see a fire starting inside Aryan's room. His father busts through the door where Aryan hurls him into the fire.\n\nDr. Ranveer devises a plan to lure Aryan into believing that Sanjana is back to warn Ria about Aryan and he finds out that it was just a trick to show Ria his true self. Ria feels horrible that she trusted and loved someone like him and Aryan gets dragged away by the police for attempting to kill \"Sanjana\", who was really Ria's friend. A while later, Dr. Ranveer gets a call saying that Aryan has escaped from prison. Ria tells her parents that he knows they are at the factory and will come and get her and if she refuses to leave with him, he will kill her.\n\nAryan arrives with his friends and breaks into the factory. Aryan ask Ria to come with him. Dr. Ranveer pulls an anchor attached to a rope which goes through Aryan, killing him.\n\nThe next morning Dr. Ranveer drops Ria off at college and tells her that she needs to be strong and not think of this again. She runs into her friends who joke and laugh with her as Dr. Ranveer looks at his daughter smiling and he wipes away a tear from his eye, knowing that everything is back to normal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Amitabh Bachchan]] as Dr. Ranveer Malhotra, A doctor from Mumbai who protected his daughter Ria but failed to protect his son Rohit.\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] as Aryan Trivedi, A deadly and obsessed man who is madly in love with Ria. \n* [[Bipasha Basu]] as Ria Malhotra, A young college student who is also Sheetal & Ranveer's daughter.\n* [[Supriya Pilgaonkar]] as Sheetal Malhotra, Ranveer's wife and Ria's mother.\n* [[Ali Asgar (actor)|Ali Asgar]] as Deepak, Ria's friend\n* [[Amardeep Jha]] as Mrs. Trivedi, Aryan's mother.\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Dr. Freddie, Ranveer's friend.\n* [[Pramod Moutho]] as Police Commissioner\n* [[Shruti Ulfat]] as Sanjana, Aryan's college teacher who left for America to get married.\n* [[Prithvi Zutshi]] as Dev Trivedi, Aryan's father who was burnt alive.\n* [[Deepak Shirke]] as Police Inspector\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{| border=\"10\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! # !!

In his tape, Alan explains that Ryan gets away with bullying him because he is the family favorite. He also states that in the past Ryan pushed him down a flight of stairs and put his head through a wall. Another victim named Nick appears in the tape and accuses Ryan of humiliating him and giving him a scar on the forehead by pushing him down some bleachers. Ryan accepts Mayhem's challenge to fight an MMA fighter. Mayhem brings Ryan to his gym and decides to let Ryan punch him in the head (which he describes as annoying but not painful). After watching Ryan in the gym he decides to put Ryan up against [[Tony Bonello|Tony 'The Gun' Bonello]]. Ryan was tapped out three times in the first round; first for a rear naked choke, and then twice more for two consecutive guillotine chokes. In the second round, he was KO'd after a kick in the gut. After the fight Alan and Ryan hug and Ryan apologizes which Alan seems to accept.\n\n*'''Bully:''' Ryan\n:'''Height:''' 6' (note: see weight below)\n:'''Weight:''' 200 lbs.

According to Adam, Vince doesn't pay rent, once threw him out of his own house, and broke his door. Vince accepts the challenge to fight, after initially hesitating. In addition to the money, Mayhem adds the additional stipulation that if Vince loses, he has to move out. He shows up to train at Mayhem's gym, during which he falls down after kicking Mayhem's bag, which causes Mayhem to laugh. He shows up to the fight and learns that his opponent will be former NFL wide receiver [[Michael Westbrook]]. During the first round, Vince tapped out four times in the first round, and was KO'd in the second round. He apologizes to Adam and Josh after the fight, but says in an interview afterwards that he will not be paying them the back rent, as the $9,000 they have just won will cover it. Adam notes that he will need a new roommate since Vince will be moving out, and asks Josh if he would like to move in with him, which Josh accepts.\n\n*'''Bully:''' Vince Carosso\n:'''Height:''' 6'7\"\n:'''Weight:''' 236 lbs.\n*'''Fighter:''' [[Michael Westbrook]]\n:'''Height:''' 6'3\"\n:'''Weight:''' 223 lbs.\n*'''Victim(s):''' Josh and Adam (bully's current and former roommate respectively)\n*'''Money earned by Bully:''' $1,000\n*'''Money earned by victim(s):''' $9,000\n*'''Original airing:''' Sunday, 29 March 2010\n\n===Christian: The Angry Couch Potato===\n''First aired 5 April 2009''\n\nMayhem helps out Cameron and Brian, by dropping [[Conor Heun|Conor \"Hurricane\" Heun]] in the cage with Christian, a lazy, couch potato with a thirst for the pain of others.\n\n*'''Bully:''' Christian\n:'''Height:'''\n:'''Weight:'''\n*'''Fighter:''' Conor \"Hurricane\" Heun\n:'''Height:''' 5'10\n:'''Weight:'''\n*'''Victim(s):''' Brian and Cameron\n*'''Money earned by Bully:''' $0\n*'''Money earned by victim(s):''' $10,000($5,000 each.)\n*'''Original airing:'''\n\n===Jonathan: The Rollerblade Bully===\n''First aired 12 April 2009''\n\nMayhem Miller helps Sergio and Thomas with Jonathan, a self-proclaimed \"aggressive in-line skater,\" who thinks he has the right to pick on weaker people in the neighborhood, by putting him in the ring with MMA champion [[Jake Shields]] to teach him a lesson he won't soon forget.\n\n*'''Bully:''' Jonathan\n:'''Height:'''\n:'''Weight:''' 175 lbs\n*'''Fighter:''' [[Jake Shields]]\n:'''Height:''' 5'11\n:'''Weight:'''\n*'''Victim(s):''' Sergio and Thomas\n*'''Money earned by Bully:''' $2000\n*'''Money earned by victim(s):''' $8000\n*'''Original airing:''' 12 April 2009\n\n===Eriq: The Bum Rapper===\n''First aired 19 April 2009''\n\nMayhem Miller helps Eriq's ex-girlfriend Linda, by putting him in the ring with MMA champion [[Jon Murphy (mixed martial arts)|Jon \"Man of Faith\" Murphy]]. She is the first female victim to appear on Bully Beatdown. Eriq taps out five times in the first round and quits very shortly into the second round, claiming his shoulder popped out. The on-site doctor found no such injury, and Linda states that Eriq frequently uses a shoulder injury claim when he fears losing a fight. The information Mayhem provided from the doctor and the statement from Linda leave the audience knowing the high likelihood that Eriq 'punked out' with a fake injury.

Wes actually managed to knock down Tony Bonello which, apparently, upset the MMA fighter enough for him to break the rules. The kick to the head was hard enough that Wes could not remember where he was, or any of the fight. Because of the illegal kick, the bully received the $5,000 for that round. However, Wes refused it, stating \"A knockout's a knockout,\" and then apologized to Chris by giving the money to him.

He also states that in the past Ryan pushed him down a flight of stairs and put his head through a wall. Another victim named Nick appears in the tape and accuses Ryan of humiliating him and giving him a scar on the forehead by pushing him down some bleachers. Ryan accepts Mayhem's challenge to fight an MMA fighter. Mayhem brings Ryan to his gym and decides to let Ryan punch him in the head (which he describes as annoying but not painful). After watching Ryan in the gym he decides to put Ryan up against [[Tony Bonello|Tony 'The Gun' Bonello]]. Ryan was tapped out three times in the first round; first for a rear naked choke, and then twice more for two consecutive guillotine chokes. In the second round, he was KO'd after a kick in the gut.

According to Adam, Vince doesn't pay rent, once threw him out of his own house, and broke his door. Vince accepts the challenge to fight, after initially hesitating. In addition to the money, Mayhem adds the additional stipulation that if Vince loses, he has to move out. He shows up to train at Mayhem's gym, during which he falls down after kicking Mayhem's bag, which causes Mayhem to laugh. He shows up to the fight and learns that his opponent will be former NFL wide receiver [[Michael Westbrook]]. During the first round, Vince tapped out four times in the first round, and was KO'd in the second round. He apologizes to Adam and Josh after the fight, but says in an interview afterwards that he will not be paying them the back rent, as the $9,000 they have just won will cover it.
