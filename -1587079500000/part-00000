She is considered to be a central figure in one of the great art movements of the century.  Throughout her career, Noskowiak photographed quite a few subjects those including landscapes, still lives and portraits. Her most well-known, and unacknowledged, portraits are of the author, John Steinbeck. In 1936, Noskowiak was awarded a prize at the annual exhibition of the San Francisco Society of Women Artist. She was also represented in the San Francisco Museum of Art\u2019s 1939 \u201cScenes from San Francisco\u201d exhibit. Ten years before her death, Noskowiak's work was included in a WPA exhibition at the Oakland Museum, in Oakland, California.\n\n\n\n==Life==\n===Early Life===\nNoskowiak was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Her father was a landscape gardener who instilled in her an awareness of the land that would later become evident in her photography.<ref name=\"Darsie2002\">{{cite book|author=Darsie Alexander|title=Original Sources: Art and Archives at the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Center for Creative Photography|year=2002|pages=149}}</ref> In her early years, she moved around the world while her father sought work in Chile, then Panama, before finally settling in Los Angeles, California in 1915.

Upon expressing her interest in photography Hagemeyer, wrote off dream as a joke in his diary. \n\n===Becoming a Photographer===\nIn early April 1929, Noskowiak met photographer [[Edward Weston]] at a party and the two began dating immediately; her eventually becoming his model, muse, pupil, and assistant. Weston first taught her to spot photos--touching up flaws in prints--before he giving her first professional camera. This camera included no film and for several months Noskowiak worked with Weston pretending to photograph while he taught her the mechanics of photography. During her time with Weston Noskowiak's photography developed tremendously showcasing her understanding of craftsmanship, as well as her own style. Several of Weston's works, such as Red Cabbage Halved and Artichoke Halved [[File:Red Cabbage Halved.jpg|thumb|Edward Weston, Artichoke Halved, 1930]], were inspired by Noskowiak's early negatives. Weston even once stated: \"Any of these I would sign as my own.\" Dora Hagemeyer (sister-in-law of Johan) wrote that while Noskowiak's photographic style was clean and direct like Weston's, she \"put into her work something which is essentially her own: a subtle and delicate loveliness.\"<ref name=\"Hagemeyer1933\">{{cite journal|first=Dora|last=Hagemeyer|date=8 September 1933|title=Noskowiak Exhibit Important to Art|journal=Carmel Pine Cone|page=4}}</ref>\n==Photography==\n===Group F.64===\nPhotography in the late 1800s and early 1900s was defined by [[pictorialism]], a style that refers to a photographer manipulating an otherwise straightforward photograph in the means of 'creating'.

In 1932 Noskowiak became an organizing member of the short-lived [[Group f/64]], which included such important photographers as [[Ansel Adams]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Willard Van Dyke]], Weston and his son [[Brett Weston|Brett]].  Noskowiak's works were shown at Group f/64's inaugural exhibition at San Francisco's M.

It is hard to say what legacy Noskowiak left behind as the discussion of her work began to dwindle after her break up with Weston.

The overuse of many pesticides in an effort to have a higher yield of crops has resulted in many of these microbes developing a tolerance against these antimicrobial agents. Currently there are over 4000 antimicrobial pesticides registered with the EPA and sold to market, showing the widespread use of these agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/what-are-antimicrobial-pesticides|title=What are Antimicrobial Pesticides?|last=US EPA|first=OCSPP|date=2013-03-15|website=US EPA|language=en|accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> It is estimated that for every single meal a person consumes, 0.3\u202fg of pesticides is used, as 90% of all pesticide use is used on agriculture.

In order to guide appropriate use of antibiotics and prevent the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance, diagnostic tests that provide clinicians with timely, actionable results are needed.\n\nAcute febrile illness is a common reason for seeking medical care worldwide and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In areas with decreasing malaria incidence, many febrile patients are inappropriately treated for malaria, and in the absence of a simple diagnostic test to identify alternative causes of fever, clinicians presume that a non-malarial febrile illness is most likely a bacterial infection, leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics. Multiple studies have shown that the use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests without reliable tools to distinguish other fever causes has resulted in increased antibiotic use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Heidi|last2=Bruxvoort|first2=Katia J|last3=Cairns|first3=Matthew E|last4=Chandler|first4=Clare I R|last5=Leurent|first5=Baptiste|last6=Ansah|first6=Evelyn K|last7=Baiden|first7=Frank|last8=Baltzell|first8=Kimberly A|last9=Bj\u00f6rkman|first9=Anders|last10=Burchett|first10=Helen E D|last11=Clarke|first11=Si\u00e2n E|date=29 March 2017|title=Impact of introduction of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria on antibiotic prescribing: analysis of observational and randomised studies in public and private healthcare settings|journal=BMJ|volume=356|language=en|pages=j1054|doi=10.1136/bmj.j1054|issn=0959-8138|pmc=5370398|pmid=28356302}}</ref>\n\n[[Antibiotic sensitivity|Antimicrobial susceptibility testing]] (AST) can help practitioners avoid prescribing unnecessary antibiotics in the style of [[precision medicine]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mddionline.com/diagnostics-are-helping-counter-antimicrobial-resistance-more-work-needed|title=Diagnostics Are Helping Counter Antimicrobial Resistance, But More Work Is Needed|date=20 November 2018|work=MDDI Online|accessdate=2 December 2018}}</ref> and help them prescribe effective antibiotics, but with the traditional approach it could take 12 to 48 hours.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors=van Belkum A, Bachmann TT, L\u00fcdke G, Lisby JG, Kahlmeter G, Mohess A, Becker K, Hays JP, Woodford N, Mitsakakis K, Moran-Gilad J, Vila J, Peter H, Rex JH, Dunne WM | title=Developmental roadmap for antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems | journal=Nature Reviews.

The overuse of many pesticides in an effort to have a higher yield of crops has resulted in many of these microbes developing a tolerance against these antimicrobial agents. Currently there are over 4000 antimicrobial pesticides registered with the EPA and sold to market, showing the widespread use of these agents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/what-are-antimicrobial-pesticides|title=What are Antimicrobial Pesticides?|last=US EPA|first=OCSPP|date=2013-03-15|website=US EPA|language=en|accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> It is estimated that for every single meal a person consumes, 0.3\u202fg of pesticides is used, as 90% of all pesticide use is used on agriculture. A majority of these products are used to help defend against the spread of infectious diseases, and hopefully protect public health. But out of the large amount of pesticides used, it is also estimated that less than 0.1% of those antimicrobial agents, actually reach their targets.

In many cases, bioremediation is less expensive and more sustainable than other [[environmental remediation|remediation]] alternatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/ust_gr_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Green Remediation Best Management Practices: Sites with Leaking Underground Storage Tank Systems.

In some cases, specialized microbial cultures are added ([[bioaugmentation]]) to further enhance biodegradation. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are [[phytoremediation]], [[mycoremediation]], [[bioventing]], [[bioleaching]], [[landfarming]], [[bioreactor]], [[composting]], [[bioaugmentation]], [[rhizofiltration]], and [[biostimulation]].\n\n==Chemistry==\nMost bioremediation processes involve oxidation-reduction ([[Redox]]) reactions where a chemical species donates an electron ([[electron donor]]) to a different species that accepts the electron ([[electron acceptor]]).  During this process, the electron donor is said to be oxidized while the electron acceptor is reduced.  Common electron acceptors in bioremediation processes include [[oxygen]], [[nitrate]], [[manganese]] (III and IV), [[iron]] (III), [[sulfate]], [[carbon dioxide]] and some pollutants (chlorinated solvents, explosives, oxidized metals, and radionuclides).

During landfarming, contaminated soils, sediments, or sludges are incorporated into the soil surface and periodically turned over (tilled) using conventional agricultural equipment to aerate the mixture.  Composting accelerates pollutant biodegradation by mixing the waste to be treated with a bulking agent, forming into piles, and periodically mixed to increase oxygen transfer.  [[Bioventing]] is a process that increases the oxygen or air flow into the unsaturated zone of the soil which increases the rate of natural in situ degradation of the targeted hydrocarbon contaminant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frutos|first=F.

Recirculation systems typically consist of a combination of injection wells or galleries and one or more recovery wells where the extracted groundwater is treated, oxygenated, amended with nutrients and reinjected.  However, the amount of oxygen that can be provided by this method is limited by the low solubility of oxygen in water (8 to 10&nbsp;mg/L for water in equilibrium with air at typical temperatures).  Greater amounts of oxygen can be provided by contacting the water with pure oxygen or addition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to the water.  In some cases, slurries of solid calcium or magnesium peroxide are injected under pressure through soil borings.  These solid peroxides react with water releasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which then decomposes releasing oxygen.  Air sparging involves the injection of air under pressure below the water table.  The air injection pressure must be great enough to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water and resistance to air flow through the soil.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Air Sparging Design Paradigm|last=Leeson|first=Andrea|publisher=BATTELLE COLUMBUS OH|year=2002|isbn=|location=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA492279|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Anaerobic==\nAnaerobic bioremediation can be employed to treat a broad range of oxidized contaminants including chlorinated ethenes ([[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]], [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]], [[Dichloroethene|DCE]], [[Vinyl chloride|VC)]], chlorinated ethanes ([[Trichloroethane|TCA]], [[Dichloroethane|DCA]]), chloromethanes ([[Carbon tetrachloride|CT]], [[Chloroform|CF]]), chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, various energetics (e.g., [[perchlorate]],<ref>{{cite book|title=In situ bioremediation of perchlorate in groundwater|last1=Coates|first1=J.D.|last2=Jackson|first2=W.A.|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-84921-8|editor1-last=Stroo|editor1-first=Hans|location=New York|pages=29\u201353|chapter=Principles of perchlorate treatment|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-84921-8_3|name-list-format=vanc|editor2-last=Ward|editor2-first=C.

[[Hexavalent chromium]] (Cr[VI]) and uranium (U[VI]) can be reduced to less mobile and/or less toxic forms (e.g., Cr[III], U[IV]). Similarly, reduction of sulfate to sulfide (sulfidogenesis) can be used to precipitate certain metals (e.g., [[zinc]], [[cadmium]]). The choice of substrate and the method of injection depend on the contaminant type and distribution in the aquifer, hydrogeology, and remediation objectives. Substrate can be added using conventional well installations, by direct-push technology, or by excavation and backfill such as [[permeable reactive barrier]]s (PRB) or biowalls. Slow-release products composed of edible oils or solid substrates tend to stay in place for an extended treatment period. Soluble substrates or soluble fermentation products of slow-release substrates can potentially migrate via advection and diffusion, providing broader but shorter-lived treatment zones. The added organic substrates are first fermented to hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs).

During landfarming, contaminated soils, sediments, or sludges are incorporated into the soil surface and periodically turned over (tilled) using conventional agricultural equipment to aerate the mixture.  Composting accelerates pollutant biodegradation by mixing the waste to be treated with a bulking agent, forming into piles, and periodically mixed to increase oxygen transfer.  [[Bioventing]] is a process that increases the oxygen or air flow into the unsaturated zone of the soil which increases the rate of natural in situ degradation of the targeted hydrocarbon contaminant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frutos|first=F.

Recirculation systems typically consist of a combination of injection wells or galleries and one or more recovery wells where the extracted groundwater is treated, oxygenated, amended with nutrients and reinjected.  However, the amount of oxygen that can be provided by this method is limited by the low solubility of oxygen in water (8 to 10&nbsp;mg/L for water in equilibrium with air at typical temperatures).  Greater amounts of oxygen can be provided by contacting the water with pure oxygen or addition of [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to the water.  In some cases, slurries of solid calcium or magnesium peroxide are injected under pressure through soil borings.  These solid peroxides react with water releasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> which then decomposes releasing oxygen.  Air sparging involves the injection of air under pressure below the water table.  The air injection pressure must be great enough to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water and resistance to air flow through the soil.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Air Sparging Design Paradigm|last=Leeson|first=Andrea|publisher=BATTELLE COLUMBUS OH|year=2002|isbn=|location=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA492279|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Anaerobic==\nAnaerobic bioremediation can be employed to treat a broad range of oxidized contaminants including chlorinated ethenes ([[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]], [[Trichloroethylene|TCE]], [[Dichloroethene|DCE]], [[Vinyl chloride|VC)]], chlorinated ethanes ([[Trichloroethane|TCA]], [[Dichloroethane|DCA]]), chloromethanes ([[Carbon tetrachloride|CT]], [[Chloroform|CF]]), chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, various energetics (e.g., [[perchlorate]],<ref>{{cite book|title=In situ bioremediation of perchlorate in groundwater|last1=Coates|first1=J.D.|last2=Jackson|first2=W.A.|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-84921-8|editor1-last=Stroo|editor1-first=Hans|location=New York|pages=29\u201353|chapter=Principles of perchlorate treatment|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-84921-8_3|name-list-format=vanc|editor2-last=Ward|editor2-first=C.

[[Hexavalent chromium]] (Cr[VI]) and uranium (U[VI]) can be reduced to less mobile and/or less toxic forms (e.g., Cr[III], U[IV]). Similarly, reduction of sulfate to sulfide (sulfidogenesis) can be used to precipitate certain metals (e.g., [[zinc]], [[cadmium]]). The choice of substrate and the method of injection depend on the contaminant type and distribution in the aquifer, hydrogeology, and remediation objectives. Substrate can be added using conventional well installations, by direct-push technology, or by excavation and backfill such as [[permeable reactive barrier]]s (PRB) or biowalls. Slow-release products composed of edible oils or solid substrates tend to stay in place for an extended treatment period. Soluble substrates or soluble fermentation products of slow-release substrates can potentially migrate via advection and diffusion, providing broader but shorter-lived treatment zones. The added organic substrates are first fermented to hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs).

He was known worldwide for his appearances on [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] television as the promotion's figurehead president. Tunney's tenure was during the company's initial worldwide popularity boom in the 1980s, the peak days of \"[[Hulk Hogan|Hulkamania]]\".\n\n==Queensbury Athletic Club/Maple Leaf Wrestling==\n\n===Early life===\nIn 1930, [[Jack Corcoran]] set up Toronto's Queensbury Athletic Club (QAC, later known by the unofficial name of [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]]), along with Jack's father, John Tunney Sr., his uncle, [[Frank Tunney]], and [[Toots Mondt]].\n\n===Working for his uncle===\nIn 1952, Jack entered into employment with the promotion, first as a referee and later in the booking office working alongside Frank, Norm Kimber, Frank Ayerst, Ed Noonan, and wrestlers [[Whipper Billy Watson]] and Pat Flanagan, as they promoted all over southern Ontario. The offices were in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] for many years. In the mid 1970s the office was moved across the street on Carlton St.\n\nOn March 16, 1956, the first title change to take place in Maple Leaf Gardens happened when Whipper Billy Watson defeated Lou Thesz, ending Thesz's near 7-year reign. Thesz again lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship again at the Maple Leaf Gardens on November 14, 1957 when he lost the title to Dick Hutton.\n\nIn 1960, [[Frank Tunney]] replaced [[Sam Muchnick]] at the NWA's helm, for a year, as president. He also went on to serve as a vice president to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] in the WW(W)F, as well as having close ties with Japanese promoters. This meant non-stop action in Maple Leaf Gardens approximately every two weeks.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, a classic match at Maple Leaf Gardens directly led to the WWWF being formed after Lou Thesz beat World Champion [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] and was declared champion. After the event, however, Northeastern promoter Vincent J. McMahon refused to recognize the title change and withdrew his operation from the NWA, becoming the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF, now WWE), with Rogers as the star performer. The WWWF recognized Rogers as its first world champion in April 1963.\n\nThrough the years, there were never any serious threats to Tunney's position as ruler of pro wrestling in Toronto. Several promoters ran shows at smaller venues in the area, often with Tunney's blessing or indifference. But in the 1970s, there were two notable attempts by other promoters to run big-venue shows in Toronto.\n\nDave McKigney, a successful promoter outside Toronto and at smaller sites within the city, tried running a show at Varsity Arena in September 1971 with Tony Parisi booked in the main event. Tunney quickly scheduled a Gardens show directly against it. Parisi was a no-show and began working for Tunney the following week. According to the newspapers, the McKigney show drew 700 fans while Tunney got 15,500 at the Gardens.\n\nHistory repeated itself five years later. George Cannon and Milt Avruskin had built strong awareness of their promotion in Toronto through a TV show broadcast on Global TV and taped at the Global studios in Don Mills. They tried to parlay that visibility into running a big-venue show at the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|CNE Coliseum]], but once again Tunney moved quickly to book a Gardens show on the same day. The Toronto Star reported that only 600 people showed up for Cannon's show.\n\n===Shared allegiances===\nIn 1977, the Tunneys began looking for a partnership since their major draw (and booker), the Sheik (Edward Farhat) was nearing the end of his popularity as a heel.\n\nIn 1978, while still utilising some talent from other promotions, including balanced cards for both the AWA and WWF, Frank entered into a partnership with [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-based promoter [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], who ran NWA-affiliated [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] in [[the Carolinas]]. The arrangement was largely facilitated by [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]], a key executive with Crockett who had been a preliminary wrestler for Tunney from 1950 to 1956, before becoming a partner in the Toronto promotion. Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat became the dominant local attractions.\n\nDue to their influence at the time, and despite joining forces with Jim Crockett, Maple Leaf Wrestling did not become a one company promotion. Frank continued to pull off his share of promotional coups and, for the first few years, it wasn't unusual to see two world title matches on the same card during this time, as [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and WWWF stars continued to perform in the city. The first Gardens card with Crockett's talent featured a historic match between WWWF champ Bob Backlund against then AWA champ Nick Bockwinkel. This kind of match was fairly rare with only a few cases of two promotions matching their respective world champs against each other. The show also included with a classic Steamboat vs. Flair match, both making their Toronto debuts, for the NWA U.S. Title on the undercard.\n\nIn 1978, along with presenting top wrestlers from the U.S., The Tunneys launched the Canadian title and used it to turn Dewey Robertson and Angelo Mosca into local babyface heroes and main event stars.\n\nIn 1980, the Tunneys presented shows in Buffalo for the first time, working in alignment with the WWF who had the rights to the arena. The first shows proved somewhat successful drawing over 8,000 fans. The Tunneys would continue with sporadic shows in Buffalo over the next couple of years.\n\nIn the early '80s, rivalries between the various promotions made it difficult to bring talent from different factions together.\n\n==Jack takes over==\nOn May 10, 1983, Frank Tunney died, after which Jack and his cousin Eddie Tunney (Frank's son) took control of the promotion. With the years of experience under his belt, Jack moved into the spotlight his uncle loved, as the frontman for the promotion, while Eddie had a low public profile, as his silent partner.\n\nJack made an immediate impact on his own. The name Maple Leaf Wrestling became the common place name for the Queensbury Athletic Club. He also promoted two large summer outdoor shows at the [[Exhibition Stadium]], dubbed Night Of Champions and Return Of The Champions. The shows would feature 11 title defences and were main evented by NWA Title defenses by Harley Race against Ric Flair.\n\n===Aligning with the World Wrestling Federation===\nWhen the promotional wars heated up between Crockett and [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], Crockett felt he could no longer spare his top wrestlers for shows in Toronto, sending his B-team as attendance at the Gardens plummeted. Crockett's relationship with the promotion had become strained. He held a distrust of Tunney who persistently utilised talent from other promotions, including the WWF. Furthermore, George Scott, still a partner in the Toronto promotion, had chosen to leave Jim Crockett Promotions due to a pay dispute and was now a booker for the WWF. The Toronto cards got progressively weaker through 1983-84, dwindling down to audiences of 3,000 for some shows. [[Johnny Weaver]] was the primary booker for the shows, with [[Leo Burke]] and his brothers as the lead heels, along with [[Don Kernodle]], when the top Crockett stars were no longer available.\n\nJack decided he no longer wanted to promote cards with a mix of WWF, NWA, and other wrestling talent and decided to switch allegiances from the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] and aligned himself with Vince McMahon's [[WWE|WWF]], promoting only WWF cards north of the border. This made Toronto one of the first former NWA strongholds to jump to the WWF, starting a trend that would continue through the 1980s.\n\nAfter a 34-year run, the NWA title\u2014which had made its Gardens debut in January 1950\u2014made its final appearance in the building in May 1984. Whatever nostalgic feelings long-time fans had for the old days, the McMahon-Tunney alliance and Hulkamania captured a whole new audience, attracting sell-out crowds to the Gardens and drawing over 65,000 people to Exhibition Stadium in 1986 and 68,000 to [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] for Wrestlemania VI in 1990 to see Hulk Hogan lose the WWF title to the Ultimate Warrior.\n\nIn June 1984, barely a year since they had taken over the Queensbury Athletic Club from his late uncle Frank, Jack, with Frank's son Eddie, transferred controlling interest of the promotion to the WWF in a maneuver which officially made Toronto a WWF city.\n\n===Consequences===\nThe deal between the Tunneys and the WWF was a complex one. The WWF effectively owned Maple Leaf Wrestling and absorbed Jack Tunney into its administration as head of Canadian tours (Due to this, Jack had more power than his cousin Eddie, despite initial plans for Eddie to join Titan sports too). However, the Toronto office remained an independent entity, without which the WWF could not book shows at the Gardens and which received a percentage of every show the company ran in Canada.\n\nFor Canadian Wrestling promotions, the effect was lasting. The Canadian wrestling scene was struggling at the time, with attendance low. As critics had feared it would, the union between Tunney and McMahon crushed many other wrestling promotions in Canada. Soon, wrestling promotions across Canada fell on hard times as Tunney helped McMahon take over their territories. All-Star Wrestling in Vancouver closed down. The AWA stopped performing in Manitoba. Stu Hart's Stampede promotion began eroding until he too was forced to sell to McMahon (and later starting up again for a few years). Grand Prix, out of Montreal, fought Tunney, but also eventually succumbed. Dave McKigney's Big Time Wrestling couldn't make a go of it due to Tunney's pressuring of Ontario's Boxing & Wrestling Commission to make insurance too expensive for the little guys. New territories, such as Newfoundland were opened up by Lyons and Zarlenga, but could not compete with a WWF machine, consistently setting new attendance records.\n\nFor the WWF, moving into the struggling Canadian market, by promoting events at the Maple Leaf Gardens every month, was part of an unheard of and risky national business model, which stretched the company. However, the move made enormous business sense and was instrumental in consolidating WWF's power base in Canada, keeping their competitors out of key Canadian markets, well into the 1990s. With the Gardens locked up by the WWF, the AWA held a show at the CNE Coliseum in December 1989 that drew what remains the smallest crowd ever in the city for a show from major promotion, just 200 people. [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), the successor to Crockett, ran three shows at the Coliseum in 1990 with better results, but not good enough to keep Toronto on their schedule. On April 1, 1990 Jack Tunney and Vince McMahon set the stage for WrestleMania VI the very first wrestling event at the brand new Toronto SkyDome. The event set a one-day attendance record for the SkyDome of 67,982. WCW came back in 1993 and drew about 4,000 to SkyDome, and then made a big return to Toronto with two well-attended shows at the Air Canada Centre in 1999 before the promotion fizzled out.\n\nFor Maple Leaf Wrestling, critics feared the new partnership would make Toronto just another stop on the WWF circuit. The highest title in the territory, the Canadian Heavyweight Championship (going all the way back to the 30s) was abandoned (although it was resurrected in 1998 and continues to be recognized to this day in the Canadian independent scene). The Maple Leaf Wrestling name continued to be used for the federation's Canadian TV program (a staple of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] station [[CHCH-TV]] for many years), of which the WWF took over production after the Tunneys split from the NWA. TV tapings for the show were held in [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] and other cities in southern [[Ontario]] for the next two years, until the WWF ceased the tapings in 1986 and decided to simply use the ''Maple Leaf Wrestling'' name for the Canadian airings of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (with some Canadian footage, such as updates by on-air announcer and former wrestler [[Billy Red Lyons]], and special matches taped at Maple Leaf Gardens, added in). There were several sellouts of 18,000 at the Gardens with the WWF crew, but the city's (and, at the time, world's) attendance record was shattered [[The Big Event|by the show at CNE Stadium]] on August 28, 1986 which drew 65,000 people, with a gate of over $1&nbsp;million. At this time, Maple Leaf Wrestling basically ceased to exist. Gone were the days of homegrown talent supplemented by a steady stream of World Champions and stars from all corners of the globe to be replaced by the oncoming Hulkamania.\n\nFor the Tunney Family, the move led to a new level of reverence. In 1987, The WWF held an event called the \"Frank Tunney Memorial Tag Team Tournament\" (the NWA had held a similar event honoring Jim Crockett Sr.) in March 1987. They credited Tunney with bringing tag team matches to North America. The tournament was won by the Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell & B. Brian Blair).\n\nFor Jack Tunney, this move made him extremely influential and forged his lasting legacy:\n* Tunney was made the chief WWF Promoter for Canadian tours (the position later taken by [[Carl De Marco]]).\n* Tunney was also made the president of Titan Sports Canada, the WWF's Canadian corporate presence, after McMahon began operating under that entity in late 1989.\n* Jack Tunney and his cousin Eddie Tunney retained a one-third stake in the Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion, with George Scott holding one-sixth (until 1987).\n* Tunney still controlled the booking of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto to a large extent, and also covered southern Ontario and Buffalo, New York.\n* Due to his new position, Jack, along with his associates [[Billy Red Lyons]] and Elio Zarlenga, would usually promote 40 or more WWF shows per year, making him a very important man in the expansion of the WWF, to the status that it enjoys today.\n\n[[Billy Red Lyons]], the longtime wrestling star from Dundas, Ont., who worked as a WWF television commentator at the time of the deal said: \u2033The timing was perfect, Vince (McMahon) had started to make his move all over the United States. He had big ideas and everybody thought he was just crazy, but not Jack. He saw what kind of an opportunity it was. Thank God the WWF did come in here because the business was dead in Toronto. Local wrestling cards had been drawing just 3,000 a night while the WWF was on the cusp of a popularity explosion when Tunney latched on.\u2033\n\n===As the figurehead president (September 1984 \u2013 July 12, 1995)===\nIn the summer of 1984 (in part to present Canadian fans with a familiar face as the WWF tried to expand northward) the WWF named Tunney its new figurehead \"president\" (a similar role to that of current WWE general managers) on the company's television programs, replacing [[Hisashi Shinma]]. Tunney filled this role for over a decade (while the '80s \"Hulkamania\" boom, was at its peak). This made Tunney known to fans not only in North America but also worldwide.\n\nThe title was ceremonial only to provide an authority figure to announce major decisions on television, as Tunney held no backstage power beyond that of a regional promoter; as such, his main roles were that of a storyline authority figure, to make matches, arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and announce major decisions or events on television. Still, he was thrown onto TV whenever a major decision had to be announced and his hard nosed way of doing things earned him the nickname \"The Hammerhead\". His on-air decisions were portrayed as legitimate in storylines.\n\nAs the on-screen President, Tunney \"oversaw\" many key moments and some of his major television appearances included:\n\n* 1986 \u2013 Suspending [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] from competition after he failed to show for a series of matches.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/146 146]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/146}}</ref> The last being a match in which Andre was supposed to team with Hillbilly Jim against [[Big John Studd]] and [[King Kong Bundy]]. [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"the Brain\" Heenan]] was upset and asked Tunney to suspend him, which he did. Heenan later claimed that Andre was competing as the masked \"Giant Machine\", and was told by Tunney that if Andre was proven to be one of [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]], Andre would be suspended for life. (The angle regarding Andre's absence was to give Andre some much needed time off, due to a tour of Japan and to tend to health problems he was starting to experience).\n* On \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", reading proclamations and giving trophies to [[Hulk Hogan]] and Andr\u00e9 the Giant (for being [[WWE Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] for three years and attaining a 15-year undefeated streak, respectively). In one of these he unveiled a new Heavyweight Belt, which was said to be long enough for Andre's waist, as requested by his new manager Bobby Heenan. These appearances were part of an angle foreshadowing Andre's heel turn and set up the main event match at [[WrestleMania III]] as Hogan's trophy was reportedly bigger than Andre's.\n* January 26, 1987 \u2013 Suspending referee [[Dan Marsh|Danny Davis]] \"for life plus ten years\" after officiating a match where Davis allowed [[The Hart Foundation]] to use illegal double-team maneuvers before defeating the [[British Bulldogs]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=Encyclopedia/><ref name=\"HartFoundation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212221 |title=Hart Foundation's first reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516215723/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212221 |archivedate=May 16, 2007 }}</ref> He had already officiated a series of controversial matches where he favored the heels<ref name=Encyclopedia/> for which Tunney had forced an apology from Davis, which included the line \"...even though I don't mean it\".\n* Later in 1987, in response to the kidnapping of the [[British Bulldogs]] canine mascot Matilda, indefinitely suspending [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] until Matilda was found. The Islanders, as part of an angle, kidnapped Matilda during a match to heat up their feud.\n* February 5, 1988, during another Hulk Hogan versus Andre The Giant match. Dave Hebner was supposed to be the referee, but it turned out that Ted DiBiase had paid off Dave's twin brother, Earl, to screw Hogan out of the  Title. At one point, Andre had Hogan pinned and, although Hogan had a shoulder up, a three count was recorded anyway. Dave came to the ring and argued with his brother. Andre ended up handing the belt to DiBiase.\n* Several times, Tunney's presence was known even off-camera. One such example was, as part of an angle involving the Andre-Hogan match aired on ''[[The Main Event I]]''. As the ''Superstars of Wrestling'' program that aired February 6, 1988 was produced prior to the airing of ''The Main Event'' (where Andre's title win was booked to take place), a side storyline was contrived to have Tunney place a \"[[gag order]]\" on announcers and commentators from discussing the events surrounding the Andre-Hogan match. Heel color commentator [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura]] attempted to bring up the subject several times but was censored each time, upsetting him so much that he left the broadcast booth toward the end of the show.\n* Stripping [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] of the WWF Heavyweight Championship after acquiring the title from new champion Andr\u00e9 the Giant in exchange for a huge financial payoff. Tunney, who also refused to return the title to Hogan by voiding Andre's controversial pinfall win, declared the championship vacant and announced a 14-man tournament to compete for the held-up championship at [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF Heavyweight Championship tournament was eventually won by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, who defeated Dibiase in the final round.\n* 1988 \u2013 Tunney was rarely involved in physical confrontations with wrestlers. One exception was when [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] confronted Tunney on the set of \"[[Bruce Prichard|The Brother Love Show]]\" and demanded a WWF title shot against then-champion Savage. When Brown began implying that Tunney and Savage's manager [[Miss Elizabeth]] were involved in an affair (suggesting that [[Miss Elizabeth]] was \"doing favors\" for Tunney to protect Savage from sure defeat), Tunney began scolding Brown for making such a claim, poking his finger in his chest to assert his authority. Brown then grabbed Tunney by his necktie and warned him never to touch him again.\n* 1989 \u2013 Jack Tunney banned [[Ron Garvin|\"Rugged\" Ronnie Garvin]] from refereeing. Garvin was portraying a referee after losing a retirement match to [[Greg Valentine]], but during matches, he would fight with the wrestlers who would not listen to his orders. Despite warnings by Tunney, Garvin punched Valentine during his match against Jimmy Snuka, which led to him being banned from refereeing.\n* 1990 \u2013 He reversed The Rockers' shock tag title win at an Indiana house show to justify WWF writers ignoring the switch on TV.\n* February 10, 1990 \u2013 Jack Tunney officially announced the main event of WrestleMania VI. On February 24, Tunney announced  \"The Ultimate Challenge\" where both the WWF Championship (Hulk Hogan) and Intercontinental Championship (Ultimate Warrior) would be on the line for the first-time ever during the match.\n* April 1, 1990 \u2013 The peak of Tunney's WWF reign was [[WrestleMania VI]] at Toronto's SkyDome. The first WrestleMania held outside of the U.S., the show drew over 67,000. In the main event The Ultimate Warrior (The Intercontinental champion) cleanly pinned Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World Title, and Tunney announced on television there would be no rematch.\n* April 15, 1990 on Wrestling Challenge \u2013 Jack Tunney announces that the Intercontinental title is vacant since one man cannot defend both titles. Tunney then sets up a tournament for the title.\n* 1990 \u2013 Restricting [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] to two active members following the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]]. (This action was announced to explain the departure of [[Bill Eadie]], who performed as the \"third\" Demolition member Ax, from the WWF).\n* Late 1990 \u2013 Suspending [[Rick Rude]] for making some crude remarks about the [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bossman]]'s mother for several weeks, culminating in four minutes of \"Boss Man's Mama\" jokes. Finally, Tunney had had enough and fired him. In reality, the suspension explained Rude's departure from the WWF over a dispute.\n* February 1991 \u2013 Tunney named Hulk Hogan as the number one contender for the WWF Heavyweight Title. Hogan would defeat Sergeant Slaughter to win the WWF Heavyweight Title for the third time at [[Wrestlemania VII]].\n* Fall of 1991 \u2013 [[pixelization#Pixelization as censorship|Distorting]] the [[Big Gold Belt|\"Real World\" title belt]] of [[Ric Flair]] in televised promos when he began performing for the WWF.\n* 1991 \u2013 Tunney became embroiled in a feud between the retired [[Randy Poffo|Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage]] (As a result of his loss to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII) and [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts]]. Jake ruined the wedding party of the Macho Man and [[Miss Elizabeth]] after SummerSlam 1991. Macho Man petitioned to be reinstated and the public wanted to see Savage get revenge on Roberts, but Tunney released a statement saying that he was taking the matter \"under advisement\". Savage nearly got involved in Survivor Series 1991, but in the midst of a scuffle in the ring, Roberts allowed a venomous king cobra to bite the arm of Randy Savage while Savage was restrained in the ropes. Tunney prohibited Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts from bringing his snake to the ring and officially reinstated Savage in time for a match at the ''[[Tuesday in Texas]]'' pay-per-view. Savage would defeat Roberts at this event and Tunney escorted Roberts from ringside, following the post-match beatdown of Savage and slapping [[Miss Elizabeth]]'s face.\n* On December 3, 1991 \u2013 At Tuesday in Texas, Tunney watched the Hulk Hogan-[[The Undertaker|Undertaker]] heavyweight title match from ringside to ensure a \"fair match\" with no outside interference. Toward the end of the match, Ric Flair came down and got into an argument with Tunney who was watching the match from ringside. Hogan grabbed a chair and hit Flair in the back with it. Flair fell into Tunney and they both went down. Hogan used the ashes from the Undertaker's urn to blind the Undertaker and rolled him up to win back the WWF Heavyweight Title. In the aftermath, Tunney stripped Hogan of the title and declared that the championship would be filled by the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]].\n* January 25, 1992 \u2013  At the \"Royal Rumble\", WWF President Jack Tunney gave Hogan and Undertaker an advantage in the random draw to determine the order in which wrestlers would enter the ring, promising them numbers between 20 and 30. Ric Flair<ref name=Encyclopedia/> entered at number three and lasted over an hour to become champion. During the show, Bobby Heenan called him \"Jack ''On the take'' Tunney\".\n* January 19, 1992 \u2013 On the Superstars program following the Royal Rumble, Tunney held a press conference, where he announced that Hogan the No.1 contender, meaning that he would face Flair for the WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania VIII]]. [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]], who was also in attendance and began standing up as if Tunney were about to proclaim him the top contender, was outraged and termed the announcement \"the most bogus act Jack Tunney has ever pulled off.\"\n* June 2, 1993 \u2013 Tunney granted Bret Hart entry into the [[King of the Ring (1993)]] tournament without requiring him to win a qualifying match. This was consolation for a result of Hart's controversial loss to Yokozuna at Wrestlemania IX.\n* In September 1993 \u2013 Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Shawn Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for steroids (a charge he never admitted) and that Michaels refused to drop the belt. Michaels left the WWF for around a month.\n* In the buildup to Summerslam 1993 \u2013 Tunney ruled that [[Lex Luger]] couldn't use his forearm in his match against Yokozuna unless he wore a protective pad. The point of contention was a steel plate inside Luger's arm, which opponents claimed was a weapon used to increase the force of his forearm smash finisher; Tunney said the plate was part of Luger's body. At the event, Luger won by countout when he used his forearm to knock Yokozuna out of the ring, and Yokozuna couldn't answer the 10 count. As a result, Yokozuna retained the WWF Heavyweight Title.\n* Summerslam 1993 \u2013 Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Jerry Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in his scheduled match with Bret Hart. Lawler, however, appeared on crutches (but in his wrestling gear) and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place.\n* In the summer of 1994, he forced Lawler to apologize to [[Duke Droese]] for \"demonstrating such a brutal amount of violence\".\n* January 22, 1994 \u2013 Before the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] match began, commentator Vince McMahon announced that WWF President Jack Tunney had shortened the interval between entrances from the traditional two minutes to 90 seconds due to time constraints. One of his final major appearances came in the aftermath of the Royal Rumble \u2014 both [[Bret Hart|Bret \"the Hitman\" Hart]] and Luger simultaneously eliminated each other, and two debating referees failed to agree on a winner \u2014 Tunney declared [[Bret Hart]] and Luger co-\"winners\"<ref name=Encyclopedia/> of the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994 Royal Rumble]] after it could not be determined whose feet hit the floor first. Modifying a stipulation of the Royal Rumble match's outcome, both men would be granted separate matches vs. WWF Heavyweight Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] for the title at [[WrestleMania X]].\n* January 23, 1994 \u2013 On the ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'' aired after the Royal Rumble, Tunney declared that a [[coin toss]] would determine whether Luger or Hart would get to first wrestle WWF Heavyweight Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] at [[WrestleMania X]] for the title. (A championship match at WrestleMania was the prize given to the Royal Rumble match winner.) Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first.\n* June 16, 1994 \u2013 Made a brief (and increasingly rare) live appearance for the coronation ceremony of the 1994 King Of The Ring, Owen Hart. Owen gives Tunney the brush-off so that Neidhart could crown him.\n\nUnlike later authority figures in wrestling, Jack Tunney only appeared on screen when a major decision was needed, which made his announcements seem important. Jack Tunney's on screen character was neutral, rather than the later heel authority figures. However, Tunney's decisions often upset the leading face characters, such as Hulk Hogan. Unlike the WWF's later \"[[Attitude Era]]\", which included storylines of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and others, regularly attacking authority figures, even heel wrestlers rarely got physical with Tunney.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn late 1989, Vince McMahon and Titan Sports dropped their partnership with the Tunney family, but hired Jack as the head of Titan Sports Canada. This cut Eddie Tunney, who had been Jack's partner, out of the partnership with the WWF. Eddie Tunney sued Titan and Jack Tunney. Titan  had made the security deposit that reserved the Skydome for WrestleMania VI, and Eddie Tunney had signed the check. Eddie Tunney had also trademarked the \"WrestleMania\" name in Canada. Titan Sports had to settle the lawsuit with Eddie Tunney in order to run WrestleMania VI.\n\nTunney supposedly witnessed [[Terry Garvin]] sexually harass former WWF referee Mike Clark in the Toronto office and was prepared to back Clark in court. Allegedly, the WWF believed that both Tunney and Clark should toe the company line and let the incident pass for the greater good of the company.\n\nAccording to the Pro Wrestling Observer, towards the end, Tunney believed it was Bret Hart who got him fired (Hart denies this). Tunney didn't think Bret would ever draw money, didn't approve of his main event push and complained publicly about various Hart-related issues. By the time Bret became the top guy, Tunney was unpopular with the faction in the office who got along with Bret.\n\nThere have long been rumors that Jack Tunney had used company money to pay off gambling debts. This has been rejected by those close to Tunney as an excuse made by the WWF for turning their backs on Jack.\n\n==Departure from the WWF==\nIn the 1990s, Tunney's appearances on television and live events grew less frequent.\n\nOn July 12, 1995, due to financial struggles, McMahon chose to close its Toronto office and run the shows in Toronto without any involvement from Tunney's Toronto office (Billy \"Red\" Lyons was also gone since he helped Tunney run the office). Tunney was forced out of the WWF, retired and disappeared from the wrestling scene.<ref name=\"PowerSlam116\">{{cite news|title=What's going down: Elsewhere|pages=6\u20137|work=Power Slam Magazine|id=116|date=March 2005|publisher=SW Publishing LTD|location=Lancaster, Lancashire, England}}</ref> Following Tunney's departure, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] was given the role of on-screen WWF President.

In November 1980, the Canadian Press reported that the government had approved the creation of a new business called Frank Tunney Sports Promotion, which was co-owned by Frank Tunney Sports Ltd., Jim Crockett Promotions Inc., and 410430 Ontario Ltd., said to be based in Hamilton.\n\nThe owner of the numbered corporation wasn't identified (it would be a matter of public record, but you have to pay a service charge to access Ontario corporate records), but Hamilton native George Scott is thought to have been the third partner. He continued to own a part of the office after the affiliation with McMahon and is said to have received a large settlement after he was pushed out of that partnership.\n\n==References==\n'''General'''\n*{{Cite web | author=Oliver, Greg | title=WWE Loses A True Titan | work=Slam!

He was known worldwide for his appearances on [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] television as the promotion's figurehead president. Tunney's tenure was during the company's initial worldwide popularity boom in the 1980s, the peak days of \"[[Hulk Hogan|Hulkamania]]\".\n\n==Queensbury Athletic Club/Maple Leaf Wrestling==\n\n===Early life===\nIn 1930, [[Jack Corcoran]] set up Toronto's Queensbury Athletic Club (QAC, later known by the unofficial name of [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]]), along with Jack's father, John Tunney Sr., his uncle, [[Frank Tunney]], and [[Toots Mondt]].\n\n===Working for his uncle===\nIn 1952, Jack entered into employment with the promotion, first as a referee and later in the booking office working alongside Frank, Norm Kimber, Frank Ayerst, Ed Noonan, and wrestlers [[Whipper Billy Watson]] and Pat Flanagan, as they promoted all over southern Ontario. The offices were in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] for many years. In the mid 1970s the office was moved across the street on Carlton St.\n\nOn March 16, 1956, the first title change to take place in Maple Leaf Gardens happened when Whipper Billy Watson defeated Lou Thesz, ending Thesz's near 7-year reign. Thesz again lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship again at the Maple Leaf Gardens on November 14, 1957 when he lost the title to Dick Hutton.\n\nIn 1960, [[Frank Tunney]] replaced [[Sam Muchnick]] at the NWA's helm, for a year, as president. He also went on to serve as a vice president to [[Vince McMahon, Sr.]] in the WW(W)F, as well as having close ties with Japanese promoters. This meant non-stop action in Maple Leaf Gardens approximately every two weeks.\n\nOn January 24, 1963, a classic match at Maple Leaf Gardens directly led to the WWWF being formed after Lou Thesz beat World Champion [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] and was declared champion. After the event, however, Northeastern promoter Vincent J. McMahon refused to recognize the title change and withdrew his operation from the NWA, becoming the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF, now WWE), with Rogers as the star performer. The WWWF recognized Rogers as its first world champion in April 1963.\n\nThrough the years, there were never any serious threats to Tunney's position as ruler of pro wrestling in Toronto. Several promoters ran shows at smaller venues in the area, often with Tunney's blessing or indifference. But in the 1970s, there were two notable attempts by other promoters to run big-venue shows in Toronto.\n\nDave McKigney, a successful promoter outside Toronto and at smaller sites within the city, tried running a show at Varsity Arena in September 1971 with Tony Parisi booked in the main event. Tunney quickly scheduled a Gardens show directly against it. Parisi was a no-show and began working for Tunney the following week. According to the newspapers, the McKigney show drew 700 fans while Tunney got 15,500 at the Gardens.\n\nHistory repeated itself five years later. George Cannon and Milt Avruskin had built strong awareness of their promotion in Toronto through a TV show broadcast on Global TV and taped at the Global studios in Don Mills. They tried to parlay that visibility into running a big-venue show at the [[Coca-Cola Coliseum|CNE Coliseum]], but once again Tunney moved quickly to book a Gardens show on the same day. The Toronto Star reported that only 600 people showed up for Cannon's show.\n\n===Shared allegiances===\nIn 1977, the Tunneys began looking for a partnership since their major draw (and booker), the Sheik (Edward Farhat) was nearing the end of his popularity as a heel.\n\nIn 1978, while still utilising some talent from other promotions, including balanced cards for both the AWA and WWF, Frank entered into a partnership with [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]-based promoter [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]], who ran NWA-affiliated [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] in [[the Carolinas]]. The arrangement was largely facilitated by [[George Scott (wrestler)|George Scott]], a key executive with Crockett who had been a preliminary wrestler for Tunney from 1950 to 1956, before becoming a partner in the Toronto promotion. Ric Flair and Ricky Steamboat became the dominant local attractions.\n\nDue to their influence at the time, and despite joining forces with Jim Crockett, Maple Leaf Wrestling did not become a one company promotion. Frank continued to pull off his share of promotional coups and, for the first few years, it wasn't unusual to see two world title matches on the same card during this time, as [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) and WWWF stars continued to perform in the city. The first Gardens card with Crockett's talent featured a historic match between WWWF champ Bob Backlund against then AWA champ Nick Bockwinkel. This kind of match was fairly rare with only a few cases of two promotions matching their respective world champs against each other. The show also included with a classic Steamboat vs. Flair match, both making their Toronto debuts, for the NWA U.S. Title on the undercard.\n\nIn 1978, along with presenting top wrestlers from the U.S., The Tunneys launched the Canadian title and used it to turn Dewey Robertson and Angelo Mosca into local babyface heroes and main event stars.\n\nIn 1980, the Tunneys presented shows in Buffalo for the first time, working in alignment with the WWF who had the rights to the arena. The first shows proved somewhat successful drawing over 8,000 fans. The Tunneys would continue with sporadic shows in Buffalo over the next couple of years.\n\nIn the early '80s, rivalries between the various promotions made it difficult to bring talent from different factions together.\n\n==Jack takes over==\nOn May 10, 1983, Frank Tunney died, after which Jack and his cousin Eddie Tunney (Frank's son) took control of the promotion. With the years of experience under his belt, Jack moved into the spotlight his uncle loved, as the frontman for the promotion, while Eddie had a low public profile, as his silent partner.\n\nJack made an immediate impact on his own. The name Maple Leaf Wrestling became the common place name for the Queensbury Athletic Club. He also promoted two large summer outdoor shows at the [[Exhibition Stadium]], dubbed Night Of Champions and Return Of The Champions. The shows would feature 11 title defences and were main evented by NWA Title defenses by Harley Race against Ric Flair.\n\n===Aligning with the World Wrestling Federation===\nWhen the promotional wars heated up between Crockett and [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]], Crockett felt he could no longer spare his top wrestlers for shows in Toronto, sending his B-team as attendance at the Gardens plummeted. Crockett's relationship with the promotion had become strained. He held a distrust of Tunney who persistently utilised talent from other promotions, including the WWF. Furthermore, George Scott, still a partner in the Toronto promotion, had chosen to leave Jim Crockett Promotions due to a pay dispute and was now a booker for the WWF. The Toronto cards got progressively weaker through 1983-84, dwindling down to audiences of 3,000 for some shows. [[Johnny Weaver]] was the primary booker for the shows, with [[Leo Burke]] and his brothers as the lead heels, along with [[Don Kernodle]], when the top Crockett stars were no longer available.\n\nJack decided he no longer wanted to promote cards with a mix of WWF, NWA, and other wrestling talent and decided to switch allegiances from the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] and aligned himself with Vince McMahon's [[WWE|WWF]], promoting only WWF cards north of the border. This made Toronto one of the first former NWA strongholds to jump to the WWF, starting a trend that would continue through the 1980s.\n\nAfter a 34-year run, the NWA title\u2014which had made its Gardens debut in January 1950\u2014made its final appearance in the building in May 1984. Whatever nostalgic feelings long-time fans had for the old days, the McMahon-Tunney alliance and Hulkamania captured a whole new audience, attracting sell-out crowds to the Gardens and drawing over 65,000 people to Exhibition Stadium in 1986 and 68,000 to [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] for Wrestlemania VI in 1990 to see Hulk Hogan lose the WWF title to the Ultimate Warrior.\n\nIn June 1984, barely a year since they had taken over the Queensbury Athletic Club from his late uncle Frank, Jack, with Frank's son Eddie, transferred controlling interest of the promotion to the WWF in a maneuver which officially made Toronto a WWF city.\n\n===Consequences===\nThe deal between the Tunneys and the WWF was a complex one. The WWF effectively owned Maple Leaf Wrestling and absorbed Jack Tunney into its administration as head of Canadian tours (Due to this, Jack had more power than his cousin Eddie, despite initial plans for Eddie to join Titan sports too). However, the Toronto office remained an independent entity, without which the WWF could not book shows at the Gardens and which received a percentage of every show the company ran in Canada.\n\nFor Canadian Wrestling promotions, the effect was lasting. The Canadian wrestling scene was struggling at the time, with attendance low. As critics had feared it would, the union between Tunney and McMahon crushed many other wrestling promotions in Canada. Soon, wrestling promotions across Canada fell on hard times as Tunney helped McMahon take over their territories. All-Star Wrestling in Vancouver closed down. The AWA stopped performing in Manitoba. Stu Hart's Stampede promotion began eroding until he too was forced to sell to McMahon (and later starting up again for a few years). Grand Prix, out of Montreal, fought Tunney, but also eventually succumbed. Dave McKigney's Big Time Wrestling couldn't make a go of it due to Tunney's pressuring of Ontario's Boxing & Wrestling Commission to make insurance too expensive for the little guys. New territories, such as Newfoundland were opened up by Lyons and Zarlenga, but could not compete with a WWF machine, consistently setting new attendance records.\n\nFor the WWF, moving into the struggling Canadian market, by promoting events at the Maple Leaf Gardens every month, was part of an unheard of and risky national business model, which stretched the company. However, the move made enormous business sense and was instrumental in consolidating WWF's power base in Canada, keeping their competitors out of key Canadian markets, well into the 1990s. With the Gardens locked up by the WWF, the AWA held a show at the CNE Coliseum in December 1989 that drew what remains the smallest crowd ever in the city for a show from major promotion, just 200 people. [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), the successor to Crockett, ran three shows at the Coliseum in 1990 with better results, but not good enough to keep Toronto on their schedule. On April 1, 1990 Jack Tunney and Vince McMahon set the stage for WrestleMania VI the very first wrestling event at the brand new Toronto SkyDome. The event set a one-day attendance record for the SkyDome of 67,982. WCW came back in 1993 and drew about 4,000 to SkyDome, and then made a big return to Toronto with two well-attended shows at the Air Canada Centre in 1999 before the promotion fizzled out.\n\nFor Maple Leaf Wrestling, critics feared the new partnership would make Toronto just another stop on the WWF circuit. The highest title in the territory, the Canadian Heavyweight Championship (going all the way back to the 30s) was abandoned (although it was resurrected in 1998 and continues to be recognized to this day in the Canadian independent scene). The Maple Leaf Wrestling name continued to be used for the federation's Canadian TV program (a staple of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] station [[CHCH-TV]] for many years), of which the WWF took over production after the Tunneys split from the NWA. TV tapings for the show were held in [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]] and other cities in southern [[Ontario]] for the next two years, until the WWF ceased the tapings in 1986 and decided to simply use the ''Maple Leaf Wrestling'' name for the Canadian airings of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'' (with some Canadian footage, such as updates by on-air announcer and former wrestler [[Billy Red Lyons]], and special matches taped at Maple Leaf Gardens, added in). There were several sellouts of 18,000 at the Gardens with the WWF crew, but the city's (and, at the time, world's) attendance record was shattered [[The Big Event|by the show at CNE Stadium]] on August 28, 1986 which drew 65,000 people, with a gate of over $1&nbsp;million. At this time, Maple Leaf Wrestling basically ceased to exist. Gone were the days of homegrown talent supplemented by a steady stream of World Champions and stars from all corners of the globe to be replaced by the oncoming Hulkamania.\n\nFor the Tunney Family, the move led to a new level of reverence. In 1987, The WWF held an event called the \"Frank Tunney Memorial Tag Team Tournament\" (the NWA had held a similar event honoring Jim Crockett Sr.) in March 1987. They credited Tunney with bringing tag team matches to North America. The tournament was won by the Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell & B. Brian Blair).\n\nFor Jack Tunney, this move made him extremely influential and forged his lasting legacy:\n* Tunney was made the chief WWF Promoter for Canadian tours (the position later taken by [[Carl De Marco]]).\n* Tunney was also made the president of Titan Sports Canada, the WWF's Canadian corporate presence, after McMahon began operating under that entity in late 1989.\n* Jack Tunney and his cousin Eddie Tunney retained a one-third stake in the Maple Leaf Wrestling promotion, with George Scott holding one-sixth (until 1987).\n* Tunney still controlled the booking of Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto to a large extent, and also covered southern Ontario and Buffalo, New York.\n* Due to his new position, Jack, along with his associates [[Billy Red Lyons]] and Elio Zarlenga, would usually promote 40 or more WWF shows per year, making him a very important man in the expansion of the WWF, to the status that it enjoys today.\n\n[[Billy Red Lyons]], the longtime wrestling star from Dundas, Ont., who worked as a WWF television commentator at the time of the deal said: \u2033The timing was perfect, Vince (McMahon) had started to make his move all over the United States. He had big ideas and everybody thought he was just crazy, but not Jack. He saw what kind of an opportunity it was. Thank God the WWF did come in here because the business was dead in Toronto. Local wrestling cards had been drawing just 3,000 a night while the WWF was on the cusp of a popularity explosion when Tunney latched on.\u2033\n\n===As the figurehead president (September 1984 \u2013 July 12, 1995)===\nIn the summer of 1984 (in part to present Canadian fans with a familiar face as the WWF tried to expand northward) the WWF named Tunney its new figurehead \"president\" (a similar role to that of current WWE general managers) on the company's television programs, replacing [[Hisashi Shinma]]. Tunney filled this role for over a decade (while the '80s \"Hulkamania\" boom, was at its peak). This made Tunney known to fans not only in North America but also worldwide.\n\nThe title was ceremonial only to provide an authority figure to announce major decisions on television, as Tunney held no backstage power beyond that of a regional promoter; as such, his main roles were that of a storyline authority figure, to make matches, arbitrate disputes between wrestlers and announce major decisions or events on television. Still, he was thrown onto TV whenever a major decision had to be announced and his hard nosed way of doing things earned him the nickname \"The Hammerhead\". His on-air decisions were portrayed as legitimate in storylines.\n\nAs the on-screen President, Tunney \"oversaw\" many key moments and some of his major television appearances included:\n\n* 1986 \u2013 Suspending [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] from competition after he failed to show for a series of matches.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/146 146]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/146}}</ref> The last being a match in which Andre was supposed to team with Hillbilly Jim against [[Big John Studd]] and [[King Kong Bundy]]. [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby \"the Brain\" Heenan]] was upset and asked Tunney to suspend him, which he did. Heenan later claimed that Andre was competing as the masked \"Giant Machine\", and was told by Tunney that if Andre was proven to be one of [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]], Andre would be suspended for life. (The angle regarding Andre's absence was to give Andre some much needed time off, due to a tour of Japan and to tend to health problems he was starting to experience).\n* On \"[[Piper's Pit]]\", reading proclamations and giving trophies to [[Hulk Hogan]] and Andr\u00e9 the Giant (for being [[WWE Championship|WWF Heavyweight Champion]] for three years and attaining a 15-year undefeated streak, respectively). In one of these he unveiled a new Heavyweight Belt, which was said to be long enough for Andre's waist, as requested by his new manager Bobby Heenan. These appearances were part of an angle foreshadowing Andre's heel turn and set up the main event match at [[WrestleMania III]] as Hogan's trophy was reportedly bigger than Andre's.\n* January 26, 1987 \u2013 Suspending referee [[Dan Marsh|Danny Davis]] \"for life plus ten years\" after officiating a match where Davis allowed [[The Hart Foundation]] to use illegal double-team maneuvers before defeating the [[British Bulldogs]] for the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]].<ref name=Encyclopedia/><ref name=\"HartFoundation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212221 |title=Hart Foundation's first reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516215723/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212221 |archivedate=May 16, 2007 }}</ref> He had already officiated a series of controversial matches where he favored the heels<ref name=Encyclopedia/> for which Tunney had forced an apology from Davis, which included the line \"...even though I don't mean it\".\n* Later in 1987, in response to the kidnapping of the [[British Bulldogs]] canine mascot Matilda, indefinitely suspending [[The Islanders (professional wrestling)|The Islanders]] until Matilda was found. The Islanders, as part of an angle, kidnapped Matilda during a match to heat up their feud.\n* February 5, 1988, during another Hulk Hogan versus Andre The Giant match. Dave Hebner was supposed to be the referee, but it turned out that Ted DiBiase had paid off Dave's twin brother, Earl, to screw Hogan out of the  Title. At one point, Andre had Hogan pinned and, although Hogan had a shoulder up, a three count was recorded anyway. Dave came to the ring and argued with his brother. Andre ended up handing the belt to DiBiase.\n* Several times, Tunney's presence was known even off-camera. One such example was, as part of an angle involving the Andre-Hogan match aired on ''[[The Main Event I]]''. As the ''Superstars of Wrestling'' program that aired February 6, 1988 was produced prior to the airing of ''The Main Event'' (where Andre's title win was booked to take place), a side storyline was contrived to have Tunney place a \"[[gag order]]\" on announcers and commentators from discussing the events surrounding the Andre-Hogan match. Heel color commentator [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse \"the Body\" Ventura]] attempted to bring up the subject several times but was censored each time, upsetting him so much that he left the broadcast booth toward the end of the show.\n* Stripping [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] of the WWF Heavyweight Championship after acquiring the title from new champion Andr\u00e9 the Giant in exchange for a huge financial payoff. Tunney, who also refused to return the title to Hogan by voiding Andre's controversial pinfall win, declared the championship vacant and announced a 14-man tournament to compete for the held-up championship at [[WrestleMania IV]]. The WWF Heavyweight Championship tournament was eventually won by \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, who defeated Dibiase in the final round.\n* 1988 \u2013 Tunney was rarely involved in physical confrontations with wrestlers. One exception was when [[Allen Coage|Bad News Brown]] confronted Tunney on the set of \"[[Bruce Prichard|The Brother Love Show]]\" and demanded a WWF title shot against then-champion Savage. When Brown began implying that Tunney and Savage's manager [[Miss Elizabeth]] were involved in an affair (suggesting that [[Miss Elizabeth]] was \"doing favors\" for Tunney to protect Savage from sure defeat), Tunney began scolding Brown for making such a claim, poking his finger in his chest to assert his authority. Brown then grabbed Tunney by his necktie and warned him never to touch him again.\n* 1989 \u2013 Jack Tunney banned [[Ron Garvin|\"Rugged\" Ronnie Garvin]] from refereeing. Garvin was portraying a referee after losing a retirement match to [[Greg Valentine]], but during matches, he would fight with the wrestlers who would not listen to his orders. Despite warnings by Tunney, Garvin punched Valentine during his match against Jimmy Snuka, which led to him being banned from refereeing.\n* 1990 \u2013 He reversed The Rockers' shock tag title win at an Indiana house show to justify WWF writers ignoring the switch on TV.\n* February 10, 1990 \u2013 Jack Tunney officially announced the main event of WrestleMania VI. On February 24, Tunney announced  \"The Ultimate Challenge\" where both the WWF Championship (Hulk Hogan) and Intercontinental Championship (Ultimate Warrior) would be on the line for the first-time ever during the match.\n* April 1, 1990 \u2013 The peak of Tunney's WWF reign was [[WrestleMania VI]] at Toronto's SkyDome. The first WrestleMania held outside of the U.S., the show drew over 67,000. In the main event The Ultimate Warrior (The Intercontinental champion) cleanly pinned Hulk Hogan to win the WWF World Title, and Tunney announced on television there would be no rematch.\n* April 15, 1990 on Wrestling Challenge \u2013 Jack Tunney announces that the Intercontinental title is vacant since one man cannot defend both titles. Tunney then sets up a tournament for the title.\n* 1990 \u2013 Restricting [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] to two active members following the [[Survivor Series (1990)|1990 Survivor Series]]. (This action was announced to explain the departure of [[Bill Eadie]], who performed as the \"third\" Demolition member Ax, from the WWF).\n* Late 1990 \u2013 Suspending [[Rick Rude]] for making some crude remarks about the [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Bossman]]'s mother for several weeks, culminating in four minutes of \"Boss Man's Mama\" jokes. Finally, Tunney had had enough and fired him. In reality, the suspension explained Rude's departure from the WWF over a dispute.\n* February 1991 \u2013 Tunney named Hulk Hogan as the number one contender for the WWF Heavyweight Title. Hogan would defeat Sergeant Slaughter to win the WWF Heavyweight Title for the third time at [[Wrestlemania VII]].\n* Fall of 1991 \u2013 [[pixelization#Pixelization as censorship|Distorting]] the [[Big Gold Belt|\"Real World\" title belt]] of [[Ric Flair]] in televised promos when he began performing for the WWF.\n* 1991 \u2013 Tunney became embroiled in a feud between the retired [[Randy Poffo|Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage]] (As a result of his loss to the Ultimate Warrior at Wrestlemania VII) and [[Jake Roberts|Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts]]. Jake ruined the wedding party of the Macho Man and [[Miss Elizabeth]] after SummerSlam 1991. Macho Man petitioned to be reinstated and the public wanted to see Savage get revenge on Roberts, but Tunney released a statement saying that he was taking the matter \"under advisement\". Savage nearly got involved in Survivor Series 1991, but in the midst of a scuffle in the ring, Roberts allowed a venomous king cobra to bite the arm of Randy Savage while Savage was restrained in the ropes. Tunney prohibited Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts from bringing his snake to the ring and officially reinstated Savage in time for a match at the ''[[Tuesday in Texas]]'' pay-per-view. Savage would defeat Roberts at this event and Tunney escorted Roberts from ringside, following the post-match beatdown of Savage and slapping [[Miss Elizabeth]]'s face.\n* On December 3, 1991 \u2013 At Tuesday in Texas, Tunney watched the Hulk Hogan-[[The Undertaker|Undertaker]] heavyweight title match from ringside to ensure a \"fair match\" with no outside interference. Toward the end of the match, Ric Flair came down and got into an argument with Tunney who was watching the match from ringside. Hogan grabbed a chair and hit Flair in the back with it. Flair fell into Tunney and they both went down. Hogan used the ashes from the Undertaker's urn to blind the Undertaker and rolled him up to win back the WWF Heavyweight Title. In the aftermath, Tunney stripped Hogan of the title and declared that the championship would be filled by the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992 Royal Rumble]].\n* January 25, 1992 \u2013  At the \"Royal Rumble\", WWF President Jack Tunney gave Hogan and Undertaker an advantage in the random draw to determine the order in which wrestlers would enter the ring, promising them numbers between 20 and 30. Ric Flair<ref name=Encyclopedia/> entered at number three and lasted over an hour to become champion. During the show, Bobby Heenan called him \"Jack ''On the take'' Tunney\".\n* January 19, 1992 \u2013 On the Superstars program following the Royal Rumble, Tunney held a press conference, where he announced that Hogan the No.1 contender, meaning that he would face Flair for the WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania VIII]]. [[Sid Eudy|Sid Justice]], who was also in attendance and began standing up as if Tunney were about to proclaim him the top contender, was outraged and termed the announcement \"the most bogus act Jack Tunney has ever pulled off.\"\n* June 2, 1993 \u2013 Tunney granted Bret Hart entry into the [[King of the Ring (1993)]] tournament without requiring him to win a qualifying match. This was consolation for a result of Hart's controversial loss to Yokozuna at Wrestlemania IX.\n* In September 1993 \u2013 Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Shawn Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that in reality, he had been suspended for testing positive for steroids (a charge he never admitted) and that Michaels refused to drop the belt. Michaels left the WWF for around a month.\n* In the buildup to Summerslam 1993 \u2013 Tunney ruled that [[Lex Luger]] couldn't use his forearm in his match against Yokozuna unless he wore a protective pad. The point of contention was a steel plate inside Luger's arm, which opponents claimed was a weapon used to increase the force of his forearm smash finisher; Tunney said the plate was part of Luger's body. At the event, Luger won by countout when he used his forearm to knock Yokozuna out of the ring, and Yokozuna couldn't answer the 10 count. As a result, Yokozuna retained the WWF Heavyweight Title.\n* Summerslam 1993 \u2013 Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Jerry Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in his scheduled match with Bret Hart. Lawler, however, appeared on crutches (but in his wrestling gear) and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place.\n* In the summer of 1994, he forced Lawler to apologize to [[Duke Droese]] for \"demonstrating such a brutal amount of violence\".\n* January 22, 1994 \u2013 Before the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] match began, commentator Vince McMahon announced that WWF President Jack Tunney had shortened the interval between entrances from the traditional two minutes to 90 seconds due to time constraints. One of his final major appearances came in the aftermath of the Royal Rumble \u2014 both [[Bret Hart|Bret \"the Hitman\" Hart]] and Luger simultaneously eliminated each other, and two debating referees failed to agree on a winner \u2014 Tunney declared [[Bret Hart]] and Luger co-\"winners\"<ref name=Encyclopedia/> of the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994 Royal Rumble]] after it could not be determined whose feet hit the floor first. Modifying a stipulation of the Royal Rumble match's outcome, both men would be granted separate matches vs. WWF Heavyweight Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] for the title at [[WrestleMania X]].\n* January 23, 1994 \u2013 On the ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]'' aired after the Royal Rumble, Tunney declared that a [[coin toss]] would determine whether Luger or Hart would get to first wrestle WWF Heavyweight Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] at [[WrestleMania X]] for the title. (A championship match at WrestleMania was the prize given to the Royal Rumble match winner.) Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first.\n* June 16, 1994 \u2013 Made a brief (and increasingly rare) live appearance for the coronation ceremony of the 1994 King Of The Ring, Owen Hart. Owen gives Tunney the brush-off so that Neidhart could crown him.\n\nUnlike later authority figures in wrestling, Jack Tunney only appeared on screen when a major decision was needed, which made his announcements seem important. Jack Tunney's on screen character was neutral, rather than the later heel authority figures. However, Tunney's decisions often upset the leading face characters, such as Hulk Hogan. Unlike the WWF's later \"[[Attitude Era]]\", which included storylines of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], and others, regularly attacking authority figures, even heel wrestlers rarely got physical with Tunney.\n\n==Controversies==\nIn late 1989, Vince McMahon and Titan Sports dropped their partnership with the Tunney family, but hired Jack as the head of Titan Sports Canada. This cut Eddie Tunney, who had been Jack's partner, out of the partnership with the WWF. Eddie Tunney sued Titan and Jack Tunney. Titan  had made the security deposit that reserved the Skydome for WrestleMania VI, and Eddie Tunney had signed the check. Eddie Tunney had also trademarked the \"WrestleMania\" name in Canada. Titan Sports had to settle the lawsuit with Eddie Tunney in order to run WrestleMania VI.\n\nTunney supposedly witnessed [[Terry Garvin]] sexually harass former WWF referee Mike Clark in the Toronto office and was prepared to back Clark in court. Allegedly, the WWF believed that both Tunney and Clark should toe the company line and let the incident pass for the greater good of the company.\n\nAccording to the Pro Wrestling Observer, towards the end, Tunney believed it was Bret Hart who got him fired (Hart denies this). Tunney didn't think Bret would ever draw money, didn't approve of his main event push and complained publicly about various Hart-related issues. By the time Bret became the top guy, Tunney was unpopular with the faction in the office who got along with Bret.\n\nThere have long been rumors that Jack Tunney had used company money to pay off gambling debts. This has been rejected by those close to Tunney as an excuse made by the WWF for turning their backs on Jack.\n\n==Departure from the WWF==\nIn the 1990s, Tunney's appearances on television and live events grew less frequent.\n\nOn July 12, 1995, due to financial struggles, McMahon chose to close its Toronto office and run the shows in Toronto without any involvement from Tunney's Toronto office (Billy \"Red\" Lyons was also gone since he helped Tunney run the office). Tunney was forced out of the WWF, retired and disappeared from the wrestling scene.<ref name=\"PowerSlam116\">{{cite news|title=What's going down: Elsewhere|pages=6\u20137|work=Power Slam Magazine|id=116|date=March 2005|publisher=SW Publishing LTD|location=Lancaster, Lancashire, England}}</ref> Following Tunney's departure, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] was given the role of on-screen WWF President. Tunney never returned to the wrestling business and this was the end of the Tunney line of Toronto wrestling promoters.\n\nOn September 17, 1995, the final WWF show was held at the Gardens and the 64-year affiliation of pro wrestling and Maple Leaf Gardens ended, since Tunney took with him the exclusive rights to wrestling at the Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nWrestling would return to Toronto on August 24, 1996, with a WWF show held outdoors at Exhibition Stadium drawing 21,211 fans.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/96.htm|title=96|publisher=thehistoryofwwe.com|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 the WWF, still unable to run shows at Maple Leaf Gardens, held a ''Monday Night Raw'' taping on January 31, 1997 at the SkyDome.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/97.htm|title=97|publisher=thehistoryofwwe.com|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaple Leaf Gardens closed entirely in 1999, and the WWF returned to regular arena shows at the [[Scotiabank Arena|Air Canada Centre]], which opened that fall.<ref name=\"theaircanadacentre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theaircanadacentre.com/about/index.asp|title=Welcome to Air Canada Centre \u2013 The Air Canada Centre|publisher=theaircanadacentre.com|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn January 24, 2004, at the age of 69, Tunney died of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Waterdown, Ontario, after a sudden illness.<ref name=\"PowerSlam116\"/>\n\nFrank Zicarelli wrote in the Toronto Sun \"He was a very kind and gracious man who did a lot for charities, too\".\n\nTunney's firing from the WWF was never resolved, and upon his death not a single representative from the WWF was present at his funeral, nor was his death announced on WWE.com. However, he is still fondly remembered by WWF fans for his numerous appearances with the company and the memorable, iconic moments he was involved in during his spell as WWF President.<ref>https://ringthedamnbell.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/remembering-jack-tunney/</ref>\n\n==Posthumous legal battle==\nAfter Jack Tunney's death in 2004, there was some discussion of whether North Carolina-based promoter [[Jim Crockett]] was ever a partner in the Toronto office.\n\nIn Canada, during most of the 1970s and the early 1980s, there was a law called the Foreign Investment Review Act (FIRA) which regulated the foreign ownership of Canadian companies. In November 1980, the Canadian Press reported that the government had approved the creation of a new business called Frank Tunney Sports Promotion, which was co-owned by Frank Tunney Sports Ltd., Jim Crockett Promotions Inc., and 410430 Ontario Ltd., said to be based in Hamilton.\n\nThe owner of the numbered corporation wasn't identified (it would be a matter of public record, but you have to pay a service charge to access Ontario corporate records), but Hamilton native George Scott is thought to have been the third partner. He continued to own a part of the office after the affiliation with McMahon and is said to have received a large settlement after he was pushed out of that partnership.\n\n==References==\n'''General'''\n*{{Cite web | author=Oliver, Greg | title=WWE Loses A True Titan | work=Slam!

Saul resolves never to go to a residential school, but his parents, converted to Christianity, are determined their eldest son will go to heaven. When the boy dies, they take him away to be blessed by a priest after he dies from his illness, leaving Saul with his grandmother  deep in the woods. The parents don\u2019t return. \n\nSaul and his grandmother stay and camp, but once cold weather starts, his grandmother decides they must continue their trek towards their ancestral lands. After their canoe capsizes, they must huddle to stay warm at night; they continue their journey on foot through snow. When his grandmother dies, Saul is discovered by the authorities and forcibly moved to a residential school. There, he meets a boy named Lonnie, who cannot speak English. The top official, Father Quinney, and his nun deem Lonnie an unsuitable name and call him Aaron, and forbid the use of the boys' [[Ojibwe language]], beating Lonnie when he cannot comply.\n\nIn the school, Saul witnesses the nuns and instructors abuse the children, and struggles to survive. One instructor, Father Gaston, seems to want to change the school. He convinces Father Quinney to allow a new outdoor activity, ice hockey. Saul does not meet the age requirement to play, but he convinces Father Gaston to give him the job of maintaining the [[ice rink|rink]] in the early morning, which allows him to spend time on the ice. From watching televised hockey games and practicing in the mornings, Saul also begins learning techniques. When one of the school's players is injured, Saul steps forward as a substitute and astounds Father Gaston with his talent. Saul declines to join Lonnie's escape attempt, as Saul was looking forward to playing; Lonnie is recaptured and punished.\n\nSaul shows remarkable hockey skills on the school team. When he becomes a teen, the school allows Saul to leave and move into a [[foster home]] with an Indigenous family in a mining town, where he can further pursue hockey. Saul joins an all-Indigenous team called the Moose, who travel to games between [[Indian reserve]]s, and receives the [[jersey number]] 13, \"for luck\". Winning a key game, Saul is treated as a star player in ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' style, but the team faces [[racial discrimination]] and beatings afterwards in a pub.\n\nSaul attracts the notice of the Toronto Monarchs, a feeder team for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], but does not want to leave his friends in the Moose. His team insists he take the offer, and he reluctantly joins the Monarchs. There, he keeps his number 13, which no one else wants due to [[Triskaidekaphobia]]. Initially excelling, he is nevertheless put off by a racist caricature of him in the newspaper. On the ice, Saul becomes the target of racist slurs from opponents and teammates alike, while the audience throws toy Indian figures onto the ice. Pushed into violence by many fouls, he is confined to the [[penalty box]]. He is stunned when Father Gaston appears one night, professing pride in where hockey has taken Saul, and admitting the abuses in the school were wrong. Father Gaston tells Saul that the church is sending him to work in Africa. Gaston's appearance causes Saul to have flashbacks to the abuses committed at the school, and he leaves the team.\n\nTaking odd low-level jobs, he drifts from place to place between 1979 and 1989. He sees Lonnie in an alley, drinking liquor. Saul drinks a lot and develops [[alcoholism]]. Facing serious health issues after severe damage to his liver, Saul is accepted by the Indigenous rehabilitation centre Rising Dawn. The group therapy leader, seeing how sad and withdrawn Saul is, encourages him to confront the root of his suffering. Saul travels back to the now closed school, where it is revealed that he had been sexually molested by Father Gaston. He makes a pilgrimage by canoe back to his ancestral lands, and then returns to his foster family, where he is happily welcomed by his foster family and former Moose teammates.\n\n==Reception==\n''Indian Horse'' was the highest-grossing English Canadian film of 2018, making $1.69 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://playbackonline.ca/2019/01/03/2018s-top-grossing-canadian-films-box-office/ |title=2018\u2032s top-grossing Canadian films, box office |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]] |date=January 3, 2018 |accessdate=January 4, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 12 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.89/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indian_horse |title=Indian Horse (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and accolades===\nThe film won the top award at the 2017 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://archive.viff.org/e-blasts/viff/2017/PR/18_VIFFAudienceAwards_PR.html |title=Indian Horse Wins Coveted VIFF Super Channel People's Choice Award |publisher=Greater Vancouver International Film Festival Society |work=33rd [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] |date=13 October 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> and the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film|Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film]] at the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#SDiFF2018|2018 San Diego International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sdfilmfest.com/award-winners/|title=Award Winners {{!}} San Diego International Film Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> \n\nSladen Peltier received a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[6th Canadian Screen Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Epilogue==\nFilm epilogue reads: \"Between the late 1800s and 1996, over 150,000 Indigenous children were sent to Residential Schools.

In 2008 the Canadian Government finally issued an apology and set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to document the truth.  We encourage everyone to open their hearts and minds to the suffering and pain inflicted upon generations of Indigenous children and families at the hands of government-sanctioned, aggressive assimilation policies.  Truth and Reconciliation requires the active participation of everyone.\"\n\n==Controversy==\nControversy erupted over the casting of [[Will Strongheart]] in the supporting role of Virgil in the film due to the actor's history of criminal domestic violence.

Saul declines to join Lonnie's escape attempt, as Saul was looking forward to playing; Lonnie is recaptured and punished.\n\nSaul shows remarkable hockey skills on the school team. When he becomes a teen, the school allows Saul to leave and move into a [[foster home]] with an Indigenous family in a mining town, where he can further pursue hockey. Saul joins an all-Indigenous team called the Moose, who travel to games between [[Indian reserve]]s, and receives the [[jersey number]] 13, \"for luck\". Winning a key game, Saul is treated as a star player in ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' style, but the team faces [[racial discrimination]] and beatings afterwards in a pub.\n\nSaul attracts the notice of the Toronto Monarchs, a feeder team for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], but does not want to leave his friends in the Moose. His team insists he take the offer, and he reluctantly joins the Monarchs. There, he keeps his number 13, which no one else wants due to [[Triskaidekaphobia]]. Initially excelling, he is nevertheless put off by a racist caricature of him in the newspaper. On the ice, Saul becomes the target of racist slurs from opponents and teammates alike, while the audience throws toy Indian figures onto the ice. Pushed into violence by many fouls, he is confined to the [[penalty box]]. He is stunned when Father Gaston appears one night, professing pride in where hockey has taken Saul, and admitting the abuses in the school were wrong. Father Gaston tells Saul that the church is sending him to work in Africa. Gaston's appearance causes Saul to have flashbacks to the abuses committed at the school, and he leaves the team.\n\nTaking odd low-level jobs, he drifts from place to place between 1979 and 1989. He sees Lonnie in an alley, drinking liquor. Saul drinks a lot and develops [[alcoholism]]. Facing serious health issues after severe damage to his liver, Saul is accepted by the Indigenous rehabilitation centre Rising Dawn. The group therapy leader, seeing how sad and withdrawn Saul is, encourages him to confront the root of his suffering. Saul travels back to the now closed school, where it is revealed that he had been sexually molested by Father Gaston. He makes a pilgrimage by canoe back to his ancestral lands, and then returns to his foster family, where he is happily welcomed by his foster family and former Moose teammates.\n\n==Reception==\n''Indian Horse'' was the highest-grossing English Canadian film of 2018, making $1.69 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://playbackonline.ca/2019/01/03/2018s-top-grossing-canadian-films-box-office/ |title=2018\u2032s top-grossing Canadian films, box office |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]] |date=January 3, 2018 |accessdate=January 4, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 12 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.89/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indian_horse |title=Indian Horse (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and accolades===\nThe film won the top award at the 2017 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://archive.viff.org/e-blasts/viff/2017/PR/18_VIFFAudienceAwards_PR.html |title=Indian Horse Wins Coveted VIFF Super Channel People's Choice Award |publisher=Greater Vancouver International Film Festival Society |work=33rd [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] |date=13 October 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> and the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film|Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film]] at the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#SDiFF2018|2018 San Diego International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sdfilmfest.com/award-winners/|title=Award Winners {{!}} San Diego International Film Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> \n\nSladen Peltier received a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[6th Canadian Screen Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Epilogue==\nFilm epilogue reads: \"Between the late 1800s and 1996, over 150,000 Indigenous children were sent to Residential Schools.  Records show at least 6,000 children died while attending the schools.  However, it is estimated to be thousands more.  In 2008 the Canadian Government finally issued an apology and set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to document the truth.  We encourage everyone to open their hearts and minds to the suffering and pain inflicted upon generations of Indigenous children and families at the hands of government-sanctioned, aggressive assimilation policies.  Truth and Reconciliation requires the active participation of everyone.\"\n\n==Controversy==\nControversy erupted over the casting of [[Will Strongheart]] in the supporting role of Virgil in the film due to the actor's history of criminal domestic violence. Strongheart has attributed his past actions to problems with drugs and alcohol, stating that he regrets such actions, and has reformed since attaining sobriety in 2010.<ref>Bellrichard, Chantelle.
