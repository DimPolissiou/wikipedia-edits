Published in 2006 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[Anchor Books|Anchor]], the novel tells the story of the [[Biafran War]]<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/books/review/Nixon.t.html|title=A Biafran Story |last=Nixon|first=Rob|date=October 1, 2006|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> through the perspective of the characters Olanna, Ugwu, and Richard.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe novel takes place in [[Nigeria]] prior to and during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] (1967\u201370). The effect of the war is shown through the dynamic relationships of five people's lives including the twin daughters of an influential businessman, a professor, a British citizen, and a Nigerian houseboy. After [[Biafra]]'s declaration of secession, the lives of the main characters drastically change and are torn apart by the brutality of the civil war and decisions in their personal lives.\n\nThe book jumps between events that took place during the early and late 1960s, when the war took place, and extends until the end of the war. In the early 1960s, the main characters are introduced: Ugwu, a 13-year-old village boy who moves in with Odenigbo, to work as his houseboy. Odenigbo frequently entertains intellectuals to discuss the political turmoil in Nigeria. Life changes for Ugwu when Odenigbo's girlfriend, Olanna, moves in with them. Ugwu forms a strong bond with both of them, and is a very loyal houseboy. Olanna has a twin sister, Kainene, a woman with a dry sense of humor, tired by the pompous company she runs for her father. Her lover Richard is an Englishman and writer goes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art.\n\nJumping four years ahead, trouble is brewing between the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and the [[Igbo people]] and hundreds of people die in massacres, including Olanna's beloved auntie and uncle. A new republic, called [[Biafra]], is created by the Igbo. As a result of the conflict, Olanna, Odenigbo, their infant daughter, whom they refer to only as \"Baby\", and Ugwu are forced to flee Nsukka, which is the university town and the major intellectual hub of the new nation. They finally end up in the refugee town of Umuahia, where they suffer and struggle due to food shortages, the constant air raids and the environment of paranoia. There are also allusions to a conflict between Olanna and Kainene, Richard and Kainene and between Olanna and Odenigbo.\n\nWhen the novel jumps back to the early 1960s, we learn that Odenigbo has slept with a village girl, Amala, who then has his baby. Olanna is furious at his betrayal, and sleeps with Richard in a moment of liberation. She goes back to Odenigbo and when they later learn that Amala refused to keep her newborn daughter, Olanna decides that they would keep her.\n\nDuring the war, Olanna, Odenigbo, Baby, and Ugwu live with Kainene and Richard, where Kainene was running a refugee camp. Their situation is hopeless, as they have no food nor medicine. Kainene decides to trade across enemy lines, but does not return, even after the end of the war a few weeks later. The book ends ambiguously, with the reader not knowing if Kainene lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Ugwu''' \u2013 The novel starts and ends with Ugwu. He is a village boy from Opi who later becomes a servant in Odenigbo's house. Under Odenigbo and Olanna's guidance, Ugwu is able to continue his education and his literary skills progress throughout the novel.<ref name=\"maslin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/books/21masl.html?_r=0|title=The Complex Business of Living While War Rages in Nigeria|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=21 September 2006|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref> He tries to maintain contact with his mother and sister, Anulika, back in his home village, and is constantly looking out for his mother's health and wellbeing.

There, he witnesses and participates in gruesome battles and a rape.\n\n'''Odenigbo''' \u2013 Odenigbo starts the novel as Professor of Mathematics at Nsukka University. His strong opinions result in some characters labeling him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d He favors [[socialism]] and [[tribalism]] to capitalism and [[Pan-Africanism]] or nationalism. After the war forces him to vacate his position at Nsukka University, Odenigbo becomes active in the war cause under Manpower Directorate .\nHis personal life is dominated by his relationship and later marriage to Olanna. He is the father of Baby, though Amala, not Olanna, is Baby's mother. Odenigbo also has a strong, albeit turbulent, relationship with his mother. \u201cMama\u201d affects his relationship with Olanna, and Mama's death starts Odenigbo on a dark path of alcoholism and depression.\n\n'''Olanna''' \u2013 Olanna is one of three characters through which the novel is told. She is the daughter of Chief Ozobia and twin of Kainene. Olanna was raised in Nigeria, and later attended university in the United Kingdom. She is described as \u201cillogically beautiful,\u201d and her appearance often dictates how others treat her. For example, her parents try to offer sex with her as a bribe to help secure business deals. Consequently, her connection with her parents is weak and she gravitates towards her Aunt Ifeka and Uncle Mbaezi in Kano. Mohammed is her ex-boyfriend and Odenigbo is her husband, and she is the adopted mother of Baby. \nProfessionally, she is a Professor of Sociology at Nsukka University before the war begins. She later works as a school teacher in Umuahia and finally helps her sister care for refugees in Orlu.\n\n'''Kainene''' \u2013 Kainene, Olanna's twin, seems to be at first very different from Olanna.

Her father, very proud of her, tells one of his friends that she is \u201cnot just like a son, she is like two.\u201d In the beginning of the war, she is a war profiteer. However, after she witnesses the war's cruelty, she changes completely as a character and instead of running her father's business, she runs a refugee camp. She remains fearless and in the end decides to trade with the enemy, putting her life at risk.\n\n'''Richard Churchill''' \u2013 Richard is an English writer who comes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art.

Richard moves to Nsukka where he teaches at the Nsukka University and attempts to write a book about the Igbo-Ukwu art. Olanna invites him to be part of Odenigbo's circle of intellectuals. Richard is glad to witness Biafra's birth, thinking it would actually make him Biafran. He starts writing a book about the war, but soon realizes that it is not his story to tell. Adichie has said in an interview that the idea of Richard came from [[Frederick Forsyth]], a staunch supporter of Biafra: \u201cRichard isn\u2019t at all like him, of course, but just the sense of an Englishman who became more Biafran than Biafrans themselves, was really an idea that came from him, Forsyth.\u201d <ref name=\"themorningnews.org\">http://www.themorningnews.org/article/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie</ref>\n\n'''Ugwu's aunty''' \u2013 Cleaner at Nsukka University, she introduces Ugwu to Master Odenigbo.\n\n'''Anulika''' \u2013 Anulika is Ugwu's sister.

Political conflict between the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa and Fulani people erupted into two deadly military coups. The Igbo tried to breakaway from Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra, but was met with little support. From 1968 onward, the war fell into a form of deadlock, with Nigerian forces unable to make significant advances into the remaining areas of Biafran control. Nigeria cut off humanitarian aid to Biafra, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilians dying from starvation and disease. Many lives and resources were lost during the war, including Adichie's grandfathers; and even today there are still tensions between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria.<ref name=\"maslin\"/><ref name=SE>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-december-30-2018-1.4462999|title=The Sunday Edition - December 30, 2018|date=December 30, 2018|last=Enright|first=Michael|type=Radio interview|language=English|publisher=CBC|orig-year=2006|minutes=|time=52:30|quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe story in ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' centres on the war. Adichie grew up in the aftermath of the war: \"The need to write about it came from growing up in its shadow. This thing that I didn't quite understand was my legacy. It hovered over everything\".<ref name=SE/> She has stated she believes that many of the issues that caused the war remain today. She further commented that the war is talked about \"in uninformed and unimaginative ways\", and that the war is as important to the Igbo people her book features today as it was then.<ref name=\"QA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.halfofayellowsun.com/content.php?page=tsbtb&n=5&f=2|title=The Story Behind the Book|year=2007|publisher=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref> Because none of the major political events were changed in the book, Adichie said that the book contained \"emotional truth\", and that the book showed the war had a significant impact upon the people of Nigeria.<ref name=\"QA\" />\n\n'''Politics and identity in post-colonial Africa'''\nThe social gatherings at Odenigbo's house are full of debates on Africa's political future. Here, the usefulness of various forms of African governance are discussed amongst the Nigerian intelligentsia. One particularly noteworthy debate involves Odenigbo defending the tribe as the ideal unit for African, as other characters stress the need for pan-Africanism or nationalism. He is quoted as proclaiming: \u201cthe only authentic identity for the African is the tribe...I am Nigerian because a white man created Nigeria and gave me that identity. I am black because the white man constructed black to be as different as possible from his white. But I was Igbo before the white man came.\u201d\n\n'''Role of Westerners in post-colonial Africa'''\nAlthough there is a clear accusation of Western influence on Biafran war (mostly England's involvement in the war), a more subtle critique is found in Richard's character. Richard, although with good intentions, tries too hard to be part of first Nigeria, and later Biafra. His fascination with the culture and his wish to be part of Biafra leads to him speaking for Biafrans by attempting to write two novels, one about the art, and the second one about the Biafran war. Richard is unable to complete either, and concludes that these are not his stories to tell. However, he is effective when he writes about the war for the Western press, which actually helps Biafra's cause. Adichie herself has said in an interview, that \u201cmaybe [Richard\u2019s character] is my subtle way of slipping in my politics that maybe it\u2019s time that Africans wrote about Africa.\u201d <ref name=\"themorningnews.org\"/>\n\n'''Relevance of academia in everyday life'''\nMany of the main characters in ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' are professors, including Olanna and Odenigbo. Odenigbo regularly hosts fellow professors from Nsukka University for political discussions on the weekends. Over the course of the novel, ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' seems to criticize both these professors and their opinions. It does this by juxtaposing the high-minded political opinions of Odenigbo and his companions from the \u201cEarly Sixties\u201d sections against the political realities of the \u201cLate Sixties\u201d sections. The novel also uses the same professors from the \u201cEarly Sixties\u201d sections and puts them in the \u201cLate Sixties\u201d sections. Also, Kainene's business mind helps her successfully run a refugee camp, whereas Olanna and Odenigbo seem ineffectual. Adichie seems to emphasize the reality of action over the ephemeral nature of opinion.\n\n'''Rule of Western journalism'''\n''Half of a Yellow Sun'' is heavily critical of the Western media's coverage of the Biafran War. The rule of Western journalism is obvious when Richard meets with the foreign journalists: \"Richard exhaled. It was like somebody sprinkling pepper on his wound: Thousands of Biafrans were dead, and this man wanted to know if there was anything new about one dead white man. Richard would write about this, the rule of Western journalism: One hundred dead black people equal one dead white person.\" Since it is clear that white journalists have a greater influence, Madu asks Richard to write about the war for the Western press: \u201cThey will take what you write more seriously because you are white. If you really want to contribute, this is the way that you can. The world has to know the truth of what is happening, because they simply cannot remain silent while we die.\u201d\n\n'''Women empowerment'''\nAlthough Half of a Yellow Sun does not have the conflict between a woman and patriarchy typical of feminist novels, it does show the agency of women. In one of the pivotal moments, Olanna is disappointed by Odenigbo's betrayal and goes to Kano to seek comfort from her family there. Aunty Ifeka says: \u201cYou must never behave as if your life belongs to a man. Your life belongs to you and you alone.\u201d Later on, even after forgiving Odenigbo, she confronts him about his betrayal and does not accept him justifying his actions by blaming his mother. On the other hand, when Olanna's father cheats on her mother, Olanna's mother does not confront him about it. She only asks Olanna to tell her father to do it more subtly.\n\n'''Marriage'''\nMarriage is a recurrent theme in ''Half of a Yellow Sun''. For the most part of the novel, Olanna and Kainene both live with men without it being question of marriage. Olanna refuses to get married many times at first, fearing that marriage would \u201cflatten [their bond] to a prosaic partnership.\" It is only during the war, when Odenigbo is invited to a town meeting in Abba and Olanna is not, that they talk again about marriage. Olanna accepts, but the wedding is done hastily and is interrupted by an air raid. Although Richard never asks Kainene to marry him, he does mention his wish for her to be his wife many times. Arize who is poor and uneducated, admires Olanna for postponing marriage but waits eagerly for a husband herself: \u201cIt is only women that know too much Book like you who can say that, Sister. If people like me who don\u2019t know book wait too long, we will expire.\u201d Adichie seems to be saying that marriage is a pragmatic choice and women who don't need to get married might chose not to even when their boyfriends are willing.\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Half of a Yellow Sun'' received the 2007 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]].<ref name=\"telegraph\" /> The award is given annually for the best original full-length [[novel]] written by a woman in English; Adichie's prize amounted to \u00a330,000.<ref name=\"telegraph\" >{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553821/Nigerian-author-wins-top-literary-prize.html|title=Nigerian author wins top literary prize|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008|date=June 7, 2007 |last=Reynolds |first=Nigel |page=1 |location=London}}</ref> The novel was well received by critics and included in the ''New York Times''\u2032s \"100 Most Notable Books of the Year\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/review/20061203notable-books.html|title=100 Notable Books of the Year|accessdate=March 18, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times | date=2006-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn a review for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', Mary Brennan called the book \"a sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060922&slug=yellowsun24|title=''Half of a Yellow Sun'': The sweeping story of a nation erased|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008|last=Brennan|first=Mary}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' had a more mixed review of the book, noting that \"at times Adichie\u2019s writing is too straightforward, the novel\u2019s pace too slack\" but also that \"whenever she touches on her favorite themes \u2014 loyalty and betrayal \u2014 her prose thrums with life.\"<ref name=\"NY\"/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' states: \u201cChimamanda Ngozi Adichie certainly lives up to the hype in her second novel, ''Half a Yellow Sun''.

Published in 2006 by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]/[[Anchor Books|Anchor]], the novel tells the story of the [[Biafran War]]<ref name=\"NY\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/01/books/review/Nixon.t.html|title=A Biafran Story |last=Nixon|first=Rob|date=October 1, 2006|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> through the perspective of the characters Olanna, Ugwu, and Richard.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe novel takes place in [[Nigeria]] prior to and during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] (1967\u201370). The effect of the war is shown through the dynamic relationships of five people's lives including the twin daughters of an influential businessman, a professor, a British citizen, and a Nigerian houseboy. After [[Biafra]]'s declaration of secession, the lives of the main characters drastically change and are torn apart by the brutality of the civil war and decisions in their personal lives.\n\nThe book jumps between events that took place during the early and late 1960s, when the war took place, and extends until the end of the war. In the early 1960s, the main characters are introduced: Ugwu, a 13-year-old village boy who moves in with Odenigbo, to work as his houseboy. Odenigbo frequently entertains intellectuals to discuss the political turmoil in Nigeria. Life changes for Ugwu when Odenigbo's girlfriend, Olanna, moves in with them. Ugwu forms a strong bond with both of them, and is a very loyal houseboy. Olanna has a twin sister, Kainene, a woman with a dry sense of humor, tired by the pompous company she runs for her father. Her lover Richard is an Englishman and writer goes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art.\n\nJumping four years ahead, trouble is brewing between the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and the [[Igbo people]] and hundreds of people die in massacres, including Olanna's beloved auntie and uncle. A new republic, called [[Biafra]], is created by the Igbo. As a result of the conflict, Olanna, Odenigbo, their infant daughter, whom they refer to only as \"Baby\", and Ugwu are forced to flee Nsukka, which is the university town and the major intellectual hub of the new nation. They finally end up in the refugee town of Umuahia, where they suffer and struggle due to food shortages, the constant air raids and the environment of paranoia. There are also allusions to a conflict between Olanna and Kainene, Richard and Kainene and between Olanna and Odenigbo.\n\nWhen the novel jumps back to the early 1960s, we learn that Odenigbo has slept with a village girl, Amala, who then has his baby. Olanna is furious at his betrayal, and sleeps with Richard in a moment of liberation. She goes back to Odenigbo and when they later learn that Amala refused to keep her newborn daughter, Olanna decides that they would keep her.\n\nDuring the war, Olanna, Odenigbo, Baby, and Ugwu live with Kainene and Richard, where Kainene was running a refugee camp. Their situation is hopeless, as they have no food nor medicine. Kainene decides to trade across enemy lines, but does not return, even after the end of the war a few weeks later. The book ends ambiguously, with the reader not knowing if Kainene lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n'''Ugwu''' \u2013 The novel starts and ends with Ugwu. He is a village boy from Opi who later becomes a servant in Odenigbo's house. Under Odenigbo and Olanna's guidance, Ugwu is able to continue his education and his literary skills progress throughout the novel.<ref name=\"maslin\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/21/books/21masl.html?_r=0|title=The Complex Business of Living While War Rages in Nigeria|last=Maslin|first=Janet|date=21 September 2006|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref> He tries to maintain contact with his mother and sister, Anulika, back in his home village, and is constantly looking out for his mother's health and wellbeing.

There, he witnesses and participates in gruesome battles and a rape.\n\n'''Odenigbo''' \u2013 Odenigbo starts the novel as Professor of Mathematics at Nsukka University. His strong opinions result in some characters labeling him as a \u201crevolutionary.\u201d He favors [[socialism]] and [[tribalism]] to capitalism and [[Pan-Africanism]] or nationalism. After the war forces him to vacate his position at Nsukka University, Odenigbo becomes active in the war cause under Manpower Directorate .\nHis personal life is dominated by his relationship and later marriage to Olanna. He is the father of Baby, though Amala, not Olanna, is Baby's mother.

She is described as \u201cillogically beautiful,\u201d and her appearance often dictates how others treat her. For example, her parents try to offer sex with her as a bribe to help secure business deals. Consequently, her connection with her parents is weak and she gravitates towards her Aunt Ifeka and Uncle Mbaezi in Kano. Mohammed is her ex-boyfriend and Odenigbo is her husband, and she is the adopted mother of Baby. \nProfessionally, she is a Professor of Sociology at Nsukka University before the war begins. She later works as a school teacher in Umuahia and finally helps her sister care for refugees in Orlu.\n\n'''Kainene''' \u2013 Kainene, Olanna's twin, seems to be at first very different from Olanna.

Her father, very proud of her, tells one of his friends that she is \u201cnot just like a son, she is like two.\u201d In the beginning of the war, she is a war profiteer. However, after she witnesses the war's cruelty, she changes completely as a character and instead of running her father's business, she runs a refugee camp. She remains fearless and in the end decides to trade with the enemy, putting her life at risk.\n\n'''Richard Churchill''' \u2013 Richard is an English writer who comes to Nigeria to explore Igbo-Ukwu art.

Richard moves to Nsukka where he teaches at the Nsukka University and attempts to write a book about the Igbo-Ukwu art. Olanna invites him to be part of Odenigbo's circle of intellectuals. Richard is glad to witness Biafra's birth, thinking it would actually make him Biafran. He starts writing a book about the war, but soon realizes that it is not his story to tell. Adichie has said in an interview that the idea of Richard came from [[Frederick Forsyth]], a staunch supporter of Biafra: \u201cRichard isn\u2019t at all like him, of course, but just the sense of an Englishman who became more Biafran than Biafrans themselves, was really an idea that came from him, Forsyth.\u201d <ref name=\"themorningnews.org\">http://www.themorningnews.org/article/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie</ref>\n\n'''Ugwu's aunty''' \u2013 Cleaner at Nsukka University, she introduces Ugwu to Master Odenigbo.\n\n'''Anulika''' \u2013 Anulika is Ugwu's sister.

Political conflict between the Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa and Fulani people erupted into two deadly military coups. The Igbo tried to breakaway from Nigeria to become the Republic of Biafra, but was met with little support. From 1968 onward, the war fell into a form of deadlock, with Nigerian forces unable to make significant advances into the remaining areas of Biafran control. Nigeria cut off humanitarian aid to Biafra, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilians dying from starvation and disease. Many lives and resources were lost during the war, including Adichie's grandfathers; and even today there are still tensions between the different ethnic and religious groups of Nigeria.<ref name=\"maslin\"/><ref name=SE>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thesundayedition/the-sunday-edition-december-30-2018-1.4462999|title=The Sunday Edition - December 30, 2018|date=December 30, 2018|last=Enright|first=Michael|type=Radio interview|language=English|publisher=CBC|orig-year=2006|minutes=|time=52:30|quote= }}</ref>\n\nThe story in ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' centres on the war. Adichie grew up in the aftermath of the war: \"The need to write about it came from growing up in its shadow. This thing that I didn't quite understand was my legacy. It hovered over everything\".<ref name=SE/> She has stated she believes that many of the issues that caused the war remain today. She further commented that the war is talked about \"in uninformed and unimaginative ways\", and that the war is as important to the Igbo people her book features today as it was then.<ref name=\"QA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.halfofayellowsun.com/content.php?page=tsbtb&n=5&f=2|title=The Story Behind the Book|year=2007|publisher=Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie|accessdate=July 27, 2008}}</ref> Because none of the major political events were changed in the book, Adichie said that the book contained \"emotional truth\", and that the book showed the war had a significant impact upon the people of Nigeria.<ref name=\"QA\" />\n\n'''Politics and identity in post-colonial Africa'''\nThe social gatherings at Odenigbo's house are full of debates on Africa's political future. Here, the usefulness of various forms of African governance are discussed amongst the Nigerian intelligentsia. One particularly noteworthy debate involves Odenigbo defending the tribe as the ideal unit for African, as other characters stress the need for pan-Africanism or nationalism. He is quoted as proclaiming: \u201cthe only authentic identity for the African is the tribe...I am Nigerian because a white man created Nigeria and gave me that identity. I am black because the white man constructed black to be as different as possible from his white. But I was Igbo before the white man came.\u201d\n\n'''Role of Westerners in post-colonial Africa'''\nAlthough there is a clear accusation of Western influence on Biafran war (mostly England's involvement in the war), a more subtle critique is found in Richard's character. Richard, although with good intentions, tries too hard to be part of first Nigeria, and later Biafra. His fascination with the culture and his wish to be part of Biafra leads to him speaking for Biafrans by attempting to write two novels, one about the art, and the second one about the Biafran war. Richard is unable to complete either, and concludes that these are not his stories to tell. However, he is effective when he writes about the war for the Western press, which actually helps Biafra's cause. Adichie herself has said in an interview, that \u201cmaybe [Richard\u2019s character] is my subtle way of slipping in my politics that maybe it\u2019s time that Africans wrote about Africa.\u201d <ref name=\"themorningnews.org\"/>\n\n'''Relevance of academia in everyday life'''\nMany of the main characters in ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' are professors, including Olanna and Odenigbo. Odenigbo regularly hosts fellow professors from Nsukka University for political discussions on the weekends. Over the course of the novel, ''Half of a Yellow Sun'' seems to criticize both these professors and their opinions. It does this by juxtaposing the high-minded political opinions of Odenigbo and his companions from the \u201cEarly Sixties\u201d sections against the political realities of the \u201cLate Sixties\u201d sections. The novel also uses the same professors from the \u201cEarly Sixties\u201d sections and puts them in the \u201cLate Sixties\u201d sections. Also, Kainene's business mind helps her successfully run a refugee camp, whereas Olanna and Odenigbo seem ineffectual. Adichie seems to emphasize the reality of action over the ephemeral nature of opinion.\n\n'''Rule of Western journalism'''\n''Half of a Yellow Sun'' is heavily critical of the Western media's coverage of the Biafran War. The rule of Western journalism is obvious when Richard meets with the foreign journalists: \"Richard exhaled. It was like somebody sprinkling pepper on his wound: Thousands of Biafrans were dead, and this man wanted to know if there was anything new about one dead white man. Richard would write about this, the rule of Western journalism: One hundred dead black people equal one dead white person.\" Since it is clear that white journalists have a greater influence, Madu asks Richard to write about the war for the Western press: \u201cThey will take what you write more seriously because you are white. If you really want to contribute, this is the way that you can. The world has to know the truth of what is happening, because they simply cannot remain silent while we die.\u201d\n\n'''Women empowerment'''\nAlthough Half of a Yellow Sun does not have the conflict between a woman and patriarchy typical of feminist novels, it does show the agency of women. In one of the pivotal moments, Olanna is disappointed by Odenigbo's betrayal and goes to Kano to seek comfort from her family there. Aunty Ifeka says: \u201cYou must never behave as if your life belongs to a man. Your life belongs to you and you alone.\u201d Later on, even after forgiving Odenigbo, she confronts him about his betrayal and does not accept him justifying his actions by blaming his mother. On the other hand, when Olanna's father cheats on her mother, Olanna's mother does not confront him about it. She only asks Olanna to tell her father to do it more subtly.\n\n'''Marriage'''\nMarriage is a recurrent theme in ''Half of a Yellow Sun''. For the most part of the novel, Olanna and Kainene both live with men without it being question of marriage. Olanna refuses to get married many times at first, fearing that marriage would \u201cflatten [their bond] to a prosaic partnership.\" It is only during the war, when Odenigbo is invited to a town meeting in Abba and Olanna is not, that they talk again about marriage. Olanna accepts, but the wedding is done hastily and is interrupted by an air raid. Although Richard never asks Kainene to marry him, he does mention his wish for her to be his wife many times. Arize who is poor and uneducated, admires Olanna for postponing marriage but waits eagerly for a husband herself: \u201cIt is only women that know too much Book like you who can say that, Sister. If people like me who don\u2019t know book wait too long, we will expire.\u201d Adichie seems to be saying that marriage is a pragmatic choice and women who don't need to get married might chose not to even when their boyfriends are willing.\n\n==Reception==\n\n''Half of a Yellow Sun'' received the 2007 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]].<ref name=\"telegraph\" /> The award is given annually for the best original full-length [[novel]] written by a woman in English; Adichie's prize amounted to \u00a330,000.<ref name=\"telegraph\" >{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1553821/Nigerian-author-wins-top-literary-prize.html|title=Nigerian author wins top literary prize|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008|date=June 7, 2007 |last=Reynolds |first=Nigel |page=1 |location=London}}</ref> The novel was well received by critics and included in the ''New York Times''\u2032s \"100 Most Notable Books of the Year\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/books/review/20061203notable-books.html|title=100 Notable Books of the Year|accessdate=March 18, 2008|newspaper=The New York Times | date=2006-11-22}}</ref>\n\nIn a review for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', Mary Brennan called the book \"a sweeping story that provides both a harrowing history lesson and an engagingly human narrative\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060922&slug=yellowsun24|title=''Half of a Yellow Sun'': The sweeping story of a nation erased|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=July 27, 2008|last=Brennan|first=Mary}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' had a more mixed review of the book, noting that \"at times Adichie\u2019s writing is too straightforward, the novel\u2019s pace too slack\" but also that \"whenever she touches on her favorite themes \u2014 loyalty and betrayal \u2014 her prose thrums with life.\"<ref name=\"NY\"/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' states: \u201cChimamanda Ngozi Adichie certainly lives up to the hype in her second novel, ''Half a Yellow Sun''.

He had few peers in 1940s, the decade for Indian film music which started with Saigal very active on the scene and ended with [[Lata Mangeshkar]] firmly established in the industry. Lata had fruitful association with him (in films ''Asha, Ziddi, [[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'') when she started making a name for herself. Many years after Khemchand Prakash's death, the ace composer Kamal Dasgupta rated him the best composer.\n\nKhemchand's brother, Basant Prakash, was also a film composer.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Sujangarh]], then located in [[Bikaner State]] in [[Rajputana Agency]] of [[British India]] (now in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]), he got his first training in music and dance from his father, who was a [[dhrupad]] singer and a [[Kathak]] dancer in the royal court. In his teens, he joined the royal court of Bikaner as a singer and later moved to the royal court of [[Nepal]]. But the destiny landed him in Kolkata and he joined the legendary New Theaters. He was assistant to composer Timir Baran in ''[[Devdas (1935 film)]]'', and he sang a comedy song 'lo kha lo madam khaanaa' (\u0932\u094b \u0916\u093e \u0932\u094b \u092e\u0945\u0921\u092e \u0916\u093e\u0928\u093e) in Street Singer (1938). He then moved to Mumbai and made his debut as music director in 1939 with Supreme Pictures' films ''Meri Aankhein'' and ''Gazi Salauddin'', and was soon signed up by ''[[Ranjit Studios|Ranjit Movietone]]'' Film Studio.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nHis initial years with Ranjit Movietone produced significant films like ''Diwali'', ''Holi'', ''Pardesi'', ''[[Fariyaad]]'', etc. [[Khursheed Bano|Khursheed]] was his leading singer and both of them gave many hits of early 40s. His biggest hit with Ranjit Studio was the film ''[[Tansen (film)|Tansen]]'' in 1943. Songs like \"Diya jalaao jagmag jagmag\", \"Rumjhum rumjhum chal tihari\", \"More balpan ke saathi\", \"Sapt suran teen gram\", \"Hath sine pe jo rakh do to karara aa jaaye\" were big hits.{{fact|date=October 2019}} In a radio programme, famous composer [[Anil Biswas]] credited Khamchand Prakash for sticking to historical perspective and musical traditions by making [[K.L. Saigal]] sing the song 'Sapt Suran Teen Gram' in the [[Dhrupad]] style, instead of the [[Khayal]] genre, which was done in other films on [[Tansen]], as he knew well that during the life and times of Tansen, the [[Khayal]] genre did not exist.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEtjqtvFAVc&list=PLduXREgbUJjho3PJkvcklhyE3CuNSWr79&index=14&t=0s</ref> \n\n1948 marked yet another significant film of his career, [[Bombay Talkies]]\u2019s ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]''.

''Mahal'' made Lata Mangeshkar a popular name. Prior to ''Mahal'', the records used to feature only the character name on the record.

He had few peers in 1940s, the decade for Indian film music which started with Saigal very active on the scene and ended with [[Lata Mangeshkar]] firmly established in the industry. Lata had fruitful association with him (in films ''Asha, Ziddi, [[Mahal (1949 film)|Mahal]]'') when she started making a name for herself. Many years after Khemchand Prakash's death, the ace composer Kamal Dasgupta rated him the best composer.\n\nKhemchand's brother, Basant Prakash, was also a film composer.\n\n==Career==\nBorn in [[Sujangarh]], then located in [[Bikaner State]] in [[Rajputana Agency]] of [[British India]] (now in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]), he got his first training in music and dance from his father, who was a [[dhrupad]] singer and a [[Kathak]] dancer in the royal court. In his teens, he joined the royal court of Bikaner as a singer and later moved to the royal court of [[Nepal]]. But the destiny landed him in Kolkata and he joined the legendary New Theaters. He was assistant to composer Timir Baran in ''[[Devdas (1935 film)]]'', and he sang a comedy song 'lo kha lo madam khaanaa' (\u0932\u094b \u0916\u093e \u0932\u094b \u092e\u0945\u0921\u092e \u0916\u093e\u0928\u093e) in Street Singer (1938). He then moved to Mumbai and made his debut as music director in 1939 with Supreme Pictures' films ''Meri Aankhein'' and ''Gazi Salauddin'', and was soon signed up by ''[[Ranjit Studios|Ranjit Movietone]]'' Film Studio.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nHis initial years with Ranjit Movietone produced significant films like ''Diwali'', ''Holi'', ''Pardesi'', ''[[Fariyaad]]'', etc. [[Khursheed Bano|Khursheed]] was his leading singer and both of them gave many hits of early 40s. His biggest hit with Ranjit Studio was the film ''[[Tansen (film)|Tansen]]'' in 1943. Songs like \"Diya jalaao jagmag jagmag\", \"Rumjhum rumjhum chal tihari\", \"More balpan ke saathi\", \"Sapt suran teen gram\", \"Hath sine pe jo rakh do to karara aa jaaye\" were big hits.{{fact|date=October 2019}} In a radio programme, famous composer [[Anil Biswas]] credited Khamchand Prakash for sticking to historical perspective and musical traditions by making [[K.L.Saigal]] sing the song 'Sapt Suran Teen Gram' in the [[Dhrupad]] style, instead of the [[Khayal]] genre, which was done in other films on [[Tansen]], as he knew well that during the life and times of Tansen, the [[Khayal]] genre did not exist.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEtjqtvFAVc&list=PLduXREgbUJjho3PJkvcklhyE3CuNSWr79&index=14&t=0s</ref> \n\n1948 marked yet another significant film of his career, [[Bombay Talkies]]\u2019s ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]''.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\". Rhoads was inspired and chose this as the name of his band.<ref>Randy Rhoads: A Life, by David A. Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]].

As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest.

The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No.&nbsp;1 album in the same week.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their success was aided in no small part by the \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" video's heavy rotation on MTV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''Metal Health'' displaced [[The Police]]'s ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' at No.&nbsp;1 and stayed there for just a week until [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' took over the No.&nbsp;1 spot.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Metal Health'''s title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;31.

At one point he even compared his band to [[The Beatles]]. DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief. Sarzo resurfaced with former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate [[Tommy Aldridge]] two years later in [[Whitesnake]], touring in support of the band's hugely successful [[Whitesnake (album)|self-titled 1987 album]]. Sarzo was permanently replaced in Quiet Riot by a reinstated Chuck Wright, after five years\u2019 absence from the band.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chuck Wright Interview|url= http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/chuck-wright-interview-quiet-riot/|publisher=Music Legends|accessdate=3 July 2013|date= 2008-06-05}}</ref> and the group temporarily added keyboardist [[John Purdell]] for their 1986 tour. That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot. Kevin DuBrow subsequently fought in court to keep control of the band's name.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Reformation and ''Metal Health'' lineup reunion (1990\u20132003)===\nHaving won the rights to the band's name, DuBrow teamed up with 21-year-old English born blues guitarist Sean Manning, bassist Kenny Hillery, and drummer Pat Ashby to reform Quiet Riot. Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''.

They eventually formed the band Heat in 1991 with bassist Kenny Hillery and drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]]. This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996. ''Greatest Hits'' covered only material from the CBS years, including three tracks from the 1988 album with Shortino and two previously promo-only live tracks.

I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace.

Originally known as  Mach 1, the name was soon changed to  Little Women before the name Quiet Riot was finally settled upon in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by an interview Rhoads heard with [[Rick Parfitt]] of the British band [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]. Parfitt frequently used the term \"quite right\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypilot.com/articles/2008/03/19/features/dpt-dubrow03122008.txt |author=Alan Blank |title=Quieting the noize |publisher=Daily Pilot |date=March 19, 2008 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> and with his thick English accent the term was pronounced \"quiet riot\". Rhoads was inspired and chose this as the name of his band.<ref>Randy Rhoads: A Life, by David A. Bene, c.2005</ref>\n\nDrew Forsyth, who had previously played with Rhoads and Garni in a band called Mildred Pierce, was hired as the new group's drummer, and an L.A. photographer named Kevin DuBrow was hired as lead vocalist. DuBrow was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of [[Alice Cooper]] or [[David Bowie]], but Dubrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.<ref name=\"metalvoice\">{{cite web |date=February 24, 2019 |title=Growing up with Randy Rhoads- Stories by Ex-Quiet Riot Kelly Garni- Part 1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNtndfLZZSI |publisher=The Metal Voice |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRhoads became the focal point of the band, both musically and visually. The \"polka-dot theme\" he incorporated onstage became Quiet Riot's visual signature during their time on the L.A. club circuit, with many fans showing up at the band's shows wearing polka-dot [[bow-tie]]s and vests in emulation of what the guitarist wore on stage.<ref name=\"csun\">{{cite web |author=California State University, Northridge |title=Randy Rhoads: Beginnings |url=http://library.csun.edu/SCA/OnlineExhibits/rhoadsbeginnings |publisher=csun.edu |accessdate=May 31, 2019}}</ref> Musically, Rhoads' talent as a lead guitarist began to spread by word of mouth, and hard rock fans from across Los Angeles began frequenting the band's gigs to hear what the fuss was about.\n\nIn the 1970s, Quiet Riot developed a friendly but intense rivalry with [[Van Halen]], a band they often played with in various L.A. clubs, including the Starwood and [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]'s Cabaret nightclub, before either act had signed a record deal. While Van Halen signed to [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1977 and released a debut album that would achieve [[RIAA certification|Gold certification]], Quiet Riot's contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony]] would see their first two albums released only in Japan, albums that to this day have never been released in the United States. The band recorded their debut album ''[[Quiet Riot (1977 album)|Quiet Riot]]'', or ''QR I'', in 1977. \n\nCoupled with their inability to secure an American recording deal, tensions between vocalist DuBrow and bassist Garni began to tear the band apart. According to Garni, \"I was on a constant quest to get him out of the band and get a different singer. I hated him, he hated me and we could not find any way whatsoever to get along which caused a lot of tension in the band and it put a lot of stress on Randy to try to be neutral.\"<ref name=\"Garni_talks\">{{Cite news |author=Parks, John |date=July 19, 2012 |title=Quiet Riot original bassist and co-founder Kelly Garni talks Randy, Kevin and his new book with LRI |url=http://www.legendaryrockinterviews.com/2012/07/19/legendary-rock-interview-with-original-quiet-riot-bassist-and-author-kelly-garni-part-one/ |publisher=legendaryrockinterviews.com |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref> Their second album ''[[Quiet Riot II]]'', or ''QR II'', was recorded at [[The Record Plant]] and released in Japan in 1978. \n\nAs ''Quiet Riot II'' was being recorded, the relationship between Garni and DuBrow finally reached its breaking point. After robbing a bar the previous night and stealing liquor, a drunken Garni unsuccessfully attempted to convince Rhoads to replace the vocalist. Garni drunkenly fired a handgun through the ceiling and a fistfight between him and Rhoads ensued. Garni then hatched a plan to drive across town to The Record Plant and kill DuBrow, who was there recording vocals for ''Quiet Riot II''. Garni was arrested for [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] before he reached the studio, and the plan to kill his bandmate waned after he sobered up. Nonetheless, Garni's time in Quiet Riot came to a swift end.<ref name=\"ucr2019\" /> Though his replacement, [[Rudy Sarzo]], was pictured and credited on ''QR II'', it was actually Garni who performed on the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/quietriot.htm |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=No Life Til Metal |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> Though he downplayed the inner conflict within the band, DuBrow would confess years later that this period of the band's existence had been extremely frustrating: \"We had one of the best guitar players ever in our band and we couldn't get arrested!\"<ref name=\"Revisited\">{{Cite news |author=Kindred, John |date=April 6, 2009 |title=Kevin DuBrow: Revisited |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/03/kevin-dubrow-revisited/ |publisher=hardrockhaven.net |accessdate=May 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1979, Rhoads began to tire of the turmoil within Quiet Riot as well as their failure to sign a US recording deal. Late that year he auditioned for [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band upon the urging of future [[Slaughter (band)|Slaughter]] bassist [[Dana Strum]].

As Quiet Riot was expected to disband at this point, Rhoads incorporated many riffs and fragments of early Quiet Riot material into the new material he was working on with Osbourne. According to Sarzo \"a lot of the Quiet Riot songs ended up on the [Osbourne] albums under different titles. Obviously Randy thought we'd never use those songs again so he'd give the riffs to Ozzy who'd come up with new words.\" For example, the main riff of the Osbourne song \"[[Suicide Solution]]\" originated as a secondary riff during the verse of a Quiet Riot demo recording entitled \"Force of Habit.\"<ref name=\"juke/ref\">[[Juke Magazine]] 22 October 1983 - \"America Calling\" section featuring Quiet Riot by Tamara Handii, page 16.</ref>\n\nAccording to DuBrow, Rhoads' departure from Quiet Riot in 1979 appeared to be the end of the line, saying that the loss \"didn't derail the band, it ended it.\"<ref name=\"Revisited\" /> He and Forsyth attempted to carry on under the Quiet Riot name for a short time with the addition of guitarist [[Greg Leon]] before the band officially broke up in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=1709 |title=Quiet Riot profile |publisher=Metal Archives |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartareandesire.com/bands/Quiet_Riot/2452/ |title=Tartarean Desire |publisher=Tartarean Desire |date= |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |title=Greg Leon interview |publisher=Sleazeroxx |date=March 25, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085910/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/leon.shtml |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> Without Rhoads, fans lost interest.

Rhoads gave him his blessing but said he wanted to check with Rudy Sarzo first.

Rhoads' mother Delores encouraged the band,<ref name=\"SarzoMemoir\" /> and in the end it was decided that \"although Randy wouldn't be in it, the original spirit of the band was back,\" according to Sarzo.<ref name=\"juke/ref\" />\n\nIn September 1982, with help from producer [[Pasha Records|Spencer Proffer]], Quiet Riot finally signed a US recording contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] and the album ''[[Metal Health]]'' was released on March 11, 1983. The group's landmark single \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" was released on August 27, 1983. A cover of a 1973 song by [[Slade]], the single spent two weeks at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100 chart in November 1983 and made history as the first heavy metal song to ever crack the Hot 100. The success of the single was instrumental in ushering in a new era of unparalleled success for heavy metal music in the 1980s and helped carry the album ''Metal Health'' to the top of ''Billboard'' album chart, making it the first American heavy metal debut album ever to reach No.&nbsp;1 in the United States. On November 26, 1983 Quiet Riot became the first heavy metal band to have a top 5 hit and No.&nbsp;1 album in the same week.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Their success was aided in no small part by the \"Cum on Feel the Noize\" video's heavy rotation on MTV.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} ''Metal Health'' displaced [[The Police]]'s ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' at No.&nbsp;1 and stayed there for just a week until [[Lionel Richie]]'s ''[[Can't Slow Down (Lionel Richie album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' took over the No.&nbsp;1 spot.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n''Metal Health'''s title track, which had been released as the album's first single on March 11, 1983, finally charted in early 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;31.

DuBrow's verbal assaults angered many of Quiet Riot's musical contemporaries and alienated fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nDuBrow's tirades led to fan backlash and clashes in the media with several other Los Angeles-based metal bands, which resulted in Rudy Sarzo quitting the group in March 1985.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Matre |first1=Lynn |title=Tempo Rock Notes |work=Chicago Tribune |date=21 March 1985}}</ref> After auditions, Kjel Benner was brought in to complete previously booked South American tour dates in April 1985.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kjel Benner: Quakertown To Quiet Riot|url= https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1985-07-19-2489518-story.html/|publisher=The Morning Call|accessdate=19 July 2019}}</ref> Despite any lingering hard feelings between DuBrow and Sarzo, the bassist briefly rejoined his former bandmates in May of 1985 for the [[Hear 'n Aid]] sessions, a charity project headed by [[Ronnie James Dio]] to raise money for African famine relief.

That year the album ''[[QR III]]'' was released and became another commercial disappointment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nFed up with DuBrow's antics and pressure from the band's management and record label, the rest of Quiet Riot fired DuBrow from his own band in February 1987 and replaced him with former [[Rough Cutt]] vocalist [[Paul Shortino]], leaving no original members in the band. Chuck Wright left the band shortly thereafter, and Sarzo was invited to return. Sarzo agreed, and while technically back in the band and even featured in some press photos for this brief liaison, he was also committed to Whitesnake at the time and could not continue onward. The group then recruited [[Sean McNabb]] for the bassist slot. The revamped band released their second self-titled album, ''[[QR (album)|Quiet Riot]]'' (also known as ''QR IV''), in October 1988. The album failed to return the band to its commercial glory. In April 1989 the band members went their separate ways. A show from their final tour was later released on a DVD titled ''[['89 Live in Japan]]''. Frankie Banali resurfaced on the [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] album ''[[The Headless Children]]'', and played some shows with [[Faster Pussycat]]. Sean McNabb joined [[House of Lords (band)|House of Lords]] in 1991, where he replaced Chuck Wright, the bass player whom he had also replaced in Quiet Riot.

Initially using the moniker Little Women (a name Rhoads and DuBrow used in the 1970s before settling on Quiet Riot) on tour to avoid any adverse publicity, DuBrow and Manning compiled songs for a new album, which would eventually turn up on the July 1993 release ''[[Terrified (album)|Terrified]]''.

This foursome reverted to the name Quiet Riot the following year, and released the aforementioned ''Terrified'' in 1993 with Banali rejoining on drums after Bobby Rondinelli joined Black Sabbath. Chuck Wright then rejoined on bass for a 1994 tour in support of ''Terrified''.{{Citation Needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThat same year, DuBrow released ''[[The Randy Rhoads Years]]'', a compilation featuring remixed tracks from Quiet Riot's two Japan-only releases along with previously unreleased material, many of which featured newly recorded vocals.<ref>''Guitar for the Practicing Musician'', December 1993: ''Rediscovering Randy Rhoads''</ref> The band released the album ''[[Down to the Bone (album)|Down to the Bone]]'' in March 1995 and a ''[[Greatest Hits (Quiet Riot album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album in February 1996.

On January 14, 2008, Banali issued the following statement via his website regarding the future of Quiet Riot:\n\n<blockquote>I have been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting Rudy Sarzo and Carlos Cavazo and to audition singers for Quiet Riot. I have also been approached to see if I would be interested in contacting and reforming the version of Quiet Riot that included Paul Shortino, Carlos Cavazo and Sean McNabb. Let me make this very simple and perfectly clear. While I am still actively involved in the business interests of Quiet Riot and will continue in that capacity, I reject any and all suggestions to have Quiet Riot continue as a live performing entity. My friendship, love and respect for Kevin DuBrow as well as my personal love and affection for Kevin's mother and his family makes it inconceivable for me to ever entertain any ovation to reform or to continue Quiet Riot. Kevin was too important to go on without him. It would also be a disrespect to the fans who have supported Quiet Riot for nearly 25 years. I thank everyone for the wonderful and sometimes unpredictable adventure that I was able to share as a member of Quiet Riot. The only regret that I have is the loss of Kevin. May he rest in peace. I now begin life after Quiet Riot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frankie-banali.com/homepage.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119203829/http://frankie-banali.com/homepage.html |archivedate=2008-01-19 |title=Frankie Banali statement |publisher=frankie-banali.com |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=May 14, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Revival with multiple vocalists (2010\u2013present)===\nDespite his previous insistence that Quiet Riot could never return as a live performing entity, Banali announced a new version of Quiet Riot in September 2010 with himself on drums, Chuck Wright on bass, Alex Grossi on guitar, and newcomer Mark Huff (formerly of the [[Van Halen]] tribute band 5150) on vocals.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/146974 |title=New Quiet Riot vocalist Mark Huff - \"I knew this was going to be an emotional thing on a lot of levels\" |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date= September 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref> The band has sought the blessings of the DuBrow family, and DuBrow's mother encouraged Banali to revive the band.<ref>Well Now You're Here, There's No Way Back - Documentary Movie</ref> In July 2011, this lineup toured Germany as support for [[Slayer]] and [[Accept (band)|Accept]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/146270 |title=Quiet Riot back in business with new singer |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 2012, whilst Huff was awaiting brain surgery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/01/13/quiet-riot-mark-huff/ |title=Ex-Quiet Riot singer Mark Huff responds to yesterday's firing |author=Amy Sciarretto|website=Noisecreep.com |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 13, 2012}}</ref> Quiet Riot released a statement, announcing that they had parted ways with Huff, and they were replacing him for upcoming dates with Keith St. John (formerly of [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]]).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/175872 |title=Quiet Riot part ways with singer Mark Huff; former Montrose vocalist Keith St. John fills in for upcoming live dates |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=January 12, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2012}}</ref> Huff found out about his firing online.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/182248 |title=Former Quiet Riot singer Mark Huff says he found about his firing online |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref> In March 2012, Banali hired unknown vocalist Scott Vokoun to fully replace Huff.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/179859 |title=Quiet Riot introduce new vocalist Scott Vokoun |magazine=Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOriginal bassist and founding member Kelly Garni released his long-awaited autobiography in October 2012.

Banali said of the song choices: \n\n<blockquote>I made a conscious decision not to use the usual songs that people would expect. I picked tracks that were special and of the moment. Let's just say that there will be a familiar track, two unexpected choices and one that really shows the roots of Quiet Riot and how the band interacted in the live arena.

Taking this opportunity, in September of that year, Japanese imperialists invaded the [[Indochina]] peninsula then colonised by France. From here, Vietnam was dominated by two foreign powers, the French and the Japanese. The Vietnamese appear to have expected Japanese support for the uprising, given the fact that the Japanese had been aiding most other Southeast Asian nations with the hope that they would support the plan for the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Instead the Vietnamese denounced the Japanese as traitors for not helping them to achieve independence from French colonial rule.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Japan Through Vietnamese Eyes (1905-1945)|journal = Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 126\u2013146|last=My-Van|first=Tran|date=March 1999|jstor = 20072109|doi = 10.1017/S0022463400008055}}</ref> With the anti-French sentiment and the imitation of the Bac Son revolutionary, many South Vietnamese provinces revolted against the French and Japanese. In Southern Indochina, the French had to deal with claims from Thailand which, backed by the Japanese, demanded territories situated to the Northwest of Cambodia's [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap|Tonle Sap]] and on the right bank of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]] in Laos. Units of Vietnamese troops were sent to the front to fight the Thais. Some of these units stationed in Saigon decided to rebel against being sent to the front. This plan was part of the program of the Party Committee for Cochin-China which from June 1940 on had actively prepared for an uprising. A plan of action was worked out with the aim of combining the actions of military units in revolt with those of worker and peasant organizations throughout Cochin-China.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vietnam, a long history (Revised edition)|last=Nguyen|first=Khac Vien|publisher=The Gioi Publishers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Hanoi|pages=224\u2013225}}</ref> As it so happened, the French did not go to war with Thailand, and thus they could devote their whole strength against the insurgents and easily decimated the South Vietnamese ICP\". With this, it can be said that the insurgents who carried out the uprising had initially believed that Thailand would involve themselves in the conflict, causing a distraction to the French, which would help them, unfortunately for them, this would not happen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Story Of Vietnam|last=Truong|first=Buu Lam|publisher=Outskirts Press Inc|year=2010|isbn=|location=Denver|pages=183}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nIn March 1940, the Standing Committee of the Party, headed by Mr. [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n T\u1ea7n]], drafted the outline to prepare for sporadic activities in the anti-French movement, and then prepared for armed uprising. Besides, many demonstrations were held during that time.\n\n[[Militia|Self-defense force]]s and guerrillas which directly led by [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n T\u1ea7n]], [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u]] were formed in big factories in Saigon such as Ba Son, FACI, pier, Cho Quan lamp, In rural areas, most communes had a squadron or even a guerrilla platoon.\n\nPopular discontent was on the rise in the South and provided, at least momentarily, an opportunity for the ICP to release its frustration at the events since the previous September. At the root of the unrest in the South was economics. High taxes, a fall in the price of rice, and an increase in unemployment all served to cut the standard of living for the average Vietnamese. Throughout the spring and summer of 1940, peasant riots against French conscription for military service along the Cambodian-Thai border, where the threat of war was high. Peasant protests against conscription took place in several towns and villages throughout the delta.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Communist Road to Power In Vietnam|last=Duiker|first=William J|publisher=Westview Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAs the wave of discontent in the South rose, the Party's Regional Committee for Cochin China attempted to ride the crest, concentrating its propaganda on peasants and newly drafted Vietnamese troops. Since the restoration of the Party apparatus in Cochin China in the early 1930s, the regional Party organization under the direction of Stalin School graduate Tran Van Giau had possessed a unique degree of autonomy and under Giau's autocratic leadership was somewhat inclined toward making decisions independent of the national party leadership. Now, with almost all members of the ICP central Committee in the South in jail, regional leaders took matters in their own hands and began to plan for a general uprising in response to the decisions reached at the Sixth Plenum the previous November. After the French surrender to Nazi Germany in June, they hastily convened an expanded Party conference in [[M\u1ef9 Tho|My Tho]], deep in the heart of the [[Mekong Delta|Mekong delta]] and agreed to initiate preparations for the insurrection. By autumn, half the indigenous troops in Cochin China were allegedly sympathetic to the Communists, with ICP sources estimating that up to 30 percent of the entire population of the colony was on its side.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAll blacksmiths produced weapons day by day in order to provide ammunition to army. The anti-war movement, combating the soldiers with the slogan \"no soldier, no penny for imperial war\" took place the people and soldiers community. Due to good military service, most of the 15,000 Vietnamese soldiers in the French army stationed in Saigon were willing to co-ordinate the uprising.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Trung Qu\u1ed1c]], 2001, Vi\u1ec7t Nam nh\u1eefng s\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n l\u1ecbch s\u1eed (1919\u20131945), H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, Nh\u00e0 xu\u1ea5t b\u1ea3n Gi\u00e1o d\u1ee5c</ref>\n\n==Development==\nParty leaders in Cochin China, however, were understandably hoping to seek support for the uprising from revolutionary elements elsewhere in the country, and in October they sent [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u]], representative of the Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party, to consult with members of the ICP Regional Committee for Tonkin. North Vietnamese delegates had not been able to attend the Sixth Plenum in November 1939 and were thus not well informed about the Central Committee's plans to move toward a general insurrection against French colonial rule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral members of the regional committee, including [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh|Truong Cinh]], Hoang Van Thu, and Hoang Quoc Viet met with [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u|Phan Dang Luu]] in early November in a suburb of Hanoi. The meeting took place in the immediate aftermath of the abortive revolt in [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|Bac Son]], and its decisions reflected an understandable ambivalence about the possibilities of armed uprising. The session reaffirmed the decision of the Sixth Plenum to begin preparations for a future armed uprising against French power, and it affirmed the contention that, if conditions were favorable, a local uprising could be launched in one area of the country even if Vietnamese society as a whole was not in a revolutionary situation. But it condemned what it considered the mistakes committed at Bac Son. The local leadership at Bac Son, it claimed, did not know how to establish revolutionary power, did not know how to conduct propaganda activities and develop revolutionary strength, and, when the battle was over, did not know how to retreat. The decision to abandon the cities for the countryside was termed an error that weakened the Party's urban base. Then, it said, the Party had lost an opportunity to launch a general uprising after French surrendered in June 1940. Finally, it criticized the new united front as vaguely defined and not sufficiently focused on the worker-peasant alliance. Looking to the future, the plenum concluded that Vietnam was not yet in a directly revolutionary situation, but that the revolution could break out in the form of local uprising where conditions were appropriate, leading the way toward a general uprising that would result in a seizure of power in the country as a whole. In perpetration for that moment, the Committee members called for the conservation of the remnants of the Bac Son forces, which were to be reorganized as guerrilla units, and for a revolutionary base in the [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc|Viet Bac]] to wait for the appropriate moment to launch an uprising.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam|last=Duiker|first=William J|publisher=Westview Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nGiven the judgments above, it is not surprising that the meeting suspected that conditions for an armed uprising were lacking in the South. Local forces were too small, and units in the Center and the North were in no position to give adequate support. So Phan Dang Luu was informed that an uprising in Cochin China should be postponed until the Central Committee could send a representative to check on the national situation and provide proper leadership. If the uprising should fail in spite of such preparations, the rebels must be prepared to make an orderly retreat and transform the defeated forces into guerrilla units.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe meeting also took steps to reconstitute the ICP Central Committee, which had become nearly defunct as the result of the recent arrest of most of its members in the South. Acting on the authority of the one remaining member, Phan Dang Luu, those in attendance named themselves a new provisional central committee with Truong Cinh serving temporarily as general secretary until new elections could be held. This November meeting of the Regional Committee of Tonkin is thus known in Party histories as the Seventh Plenum of the ICP.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nImmediately after the meeting, Phan Dang Luu returned to Cochin China to give his colleagues the bad news that their comrades in Tonkin did not favor a general uprising. But on the evening of 22 November he was arrested by French police at the railway station in Saigon. Advised in advance of the revolt, the French declared martial law and disarmed all indigenous troops in the area.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the Mekong delta, however, the Regional Committee was growing increasingly restive. With 15,000 in the uprising organization and the rebellious troops increasingly impatient for action, the Regional Committee now decided that it could wait no longer for the return of Phan Dang Luu and decided to schedule the outbreak for the night of 22\u201323 November. the uprising was concentrated on several district and provincial capitals throughout the Mekong delta. French military posts were to be attacked, communications links cut, and revolutionary power established at the village level. Attacks took place as scheduled in such delta towns as Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Tan An, Vinh Long and Can Tho, as well as in rural areas along the edge of the Plain of Reeds. In some areas, the masses seized power, formed revolutionary tribunals to punish class enemies, and raised flags in the name of the National United Front. These were plans for an attack on Saigon as well, but the French prevented disturbances by confiscating weapons and blocking entrances to the city.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe course of the insurrection can be divided into three periods. The first period was from 22 to 30 November which was the most intense period of the insurgency. The second was from 30 to 13 December when the insurrection spread to the region of the inter-provincial committee of [[Long Xuy\u00ean|Long Xuyen]] and to [[R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1|Rach Gia]] and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau|Bac Lieu]]. The final period from 12 to 31 December is centered on the Poulo-Obi incident in Bac Lieu<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title=The Indochinese Communist Party and the Nam Ky Uprising in Cochin China November December 1940|journal = South East Asia Research|volume = 5|issue = 3|pages = 269\u2013293|last=Chonchirdsim|first=Sud|date=November 1997|jstor = 23746947|doi = 10.1177/0967828X9700500304}}</ref>\n\nThe revolutionary governments were existed in very short time, the longest one in My Tho was about 49 days. French colonialists vehemently oppressed, seeking to destroy the revolutionary government. It was during this uprising that the flag of North Vietnam was raised at [[Cao L\u00e3nh (city)|Cao Lanh]] in the western delta. The revolt began in the Plaine des Joncs in the western delta and none of the northern provinces were affected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vietnam.ttu.edu/star/images/231/2310402001.pdf|title=Inequality and Insurgency in Vietnam: A re-analysis|last=Paige|first=Jeffery M.|date=1970|website=cambridge.org|access-date=2018-11-09}}</ref> The slogans of the uprising included \"Land to the Tillers, Freedom for the workers and independence for Vietnam\". One of the leaders of the uprising was a man who later became the father of the trade union movement in Vietnam, Tran Quoc Buu.

The attacks started at 10 pm on 22 November. The success of the insurrection in Gia Dinh My Tho and Can Tho on 22 and 23 November persuaded ICP insurgents in other provinces to fight. As a result, from 23 November, the insurrection spread to many provinces, even though by that time the government had started to retaliate by using all its force to suppress the rebellion.  These included aerial bombardment and the leveling of many villages. However, the government was not able to stop the uprising in the provinces. Village notables were the main targets of the attacks because they were representatives of the colonial administration of the village level. Even though their administrative power was very limited, they were still the liaison between the colonial administration and the peasants.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The 30 November-13 December period ===\nThis was the period where the insurrection in Gia Dinh, My Tho and Can Tho became less intense and the ICP was on the defensive but when fighting broke out in the inter-provincial region of Long Xuyen. Communist insurgents in that region were in disarray due to the repressive measures of the government, and were not able to rise at the same time as their comrades in other areas even though they received the insurrection order on 22 November. The ICP in this region lost a good opportunity, given that the Inter-Provincial Committee of Long Xuyen was very active in preparing the insurrection. The Long Xuyen Committee ordered its party members to manufacture arms and ammunition in September, and that in October it asked the Cochin China Committee to send instructors to teach tactics to the guerrilla groups newly formed by the Committee. Moreover, the Far West region had serious peasants problems in the second half of the 1930s which would have been an important factor if the ICP were to win over the masses should the insurrection have taken place as originally planned.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe main targets were the three town centres and their suburbs. Strategic targets such as post offices, police stations and ferries were included in the attack plans. Due to bad communications between party members and the arrest of important members of the party, the provinces of Rach Gia and Bac Lieu remained calm during this period, even though Rach Gia was the first province able to form an insurrection group, in September 1940, Ben Tre also saw only small-scale fighting during this period.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The 13\u201331 December Period ===\nThe high point of this period was the attack on Poulo Obi lighthouse in [[C\u00e0 Mau|Ca Mau]] district on 13 and 14 December which cost the life of M Olivier, A French lighthouse keeper. By the second half of December, the insurrection had lost momentum and was dying down. In most areas the ICP had to retreat, and the insurgents were only able to distribute tracts or threaten village notables but no serious attacks were undertaken. In Gia Dinh, as well as in Tan An and the Plain of Reeds, the insurgents had to retreat to the dense forests to avoid being hunted down by the authorities. According to a French report, by mid-December, the government was able to control the situation. Thousands of villages who had fled during the insurrection started to return to their homes. Schools reopened and confidence in the French authorities among the Vietnamese was gradually revived. By the end of the year, the insurrection had completely died down.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Class distinction during the uprising ===\nThe picture of solidarity between the revolutionaries and the rich peasants is contradicted by another account of the period, that the revolutionaries destroyed the crops of some rich peasants and well-off middle peasants who possessed a lot of land. A poor peasant whose resentment of the wealthier classes in his village still burned bright in 1971 said that in the pre-1945 period village officials had to be at least middle peasants, and that middle peasants were allied to the landlords and with the hamlet and village te or officials. Village officials were not without their own influence and support against the insurrection, but it was usually not enough to stem the tide. In the market town of Tan Hiep, the village chief had gathered 200 villagers to support the soldiers in the post against the large crown of peasants insurrectionists sweeping through the area. When the crowd approached, however, the villagers all fled, leaving the village officials and militia to cope with the situation. As during the \"Vietnam War\" period, loyalty to the authority structure did not always extend to defending it to the death, and there was often an asymmetry of commitment between the followers of the opposing sides.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Vietnamese War Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta 1930-1975 Volume 1|last=Elliott|first=David W.P|publisher=ME Sharpe|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=39}}</ref>\n\nThe class categories mentioned in later accounts by witnesses of the 1940 Cochinchina Uprising and the August 1945 revolution were assigned only later, during the land reform after 1945. several interview sources assert that there was little or no awareness of class labels at this time, but only a general awareness of a great divide between the minority of the rich and the majority of the poor in their province. The social and economic dominance of a small number of large landholders and the very high percentage of the rural population who were poor and landless peasants make it easy to see why the simple rich-poor categorization of provincial society was prevalent at the time. It is also clear, however, that almost all observers of these events had little difficulty in retrospectively identifying the different socioeconomic positions of the protagonists of social conflict in the 1930s in terms of the more highly differentiated class categories of a later period, even though the exact designations and terminology may have been applied retrospectively.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe seems to have been a case of a new analytic framework so exactly fitting the reality of the times that it seemed always to have been true. Everyone knew, for example, that landlords were people who owned more land than was necessary to support their families, and that they did not work the land but rented it out. Rich peasants were a less distinct category but it was generally understood that they were in essence small landlords who owned less land but still more than they needed for bare survival, who farmed what they could themselves but hired laborers or rented what they could not work to tenants. Middle peasants were self-sufficient owner-cultivators who owned just enough land to support their families, and who worked it themselves. Poor peasants may have owned a bit of land but not enough to support a family. Typically, they were tenants who rented a specified piece of land from one of the large landholders. Very poor peasants were landless peasants who worked as occasional hired laborers, usually in a depressed labor market. Although these class categories were more elaborately defined during the subsequent land reform period, they were simple and serviceable ways to describe the social reality of the 1930s and 1940s and were used consistently by both interviewees and written sources.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Vietnamese War Revolution And Social Change in the Mekong Delta 1930-1975 Volume 1|last=Elliott|first=David WP|publisher=ME Sharpe|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\nThe French response was swift. In Saigon an attempted uprising was quelled in a day; in the delta, unrest dragged on and was finally put down in early December.

Surviving Communists then purged their own ranks, condemning several to death on the accusation of being double agents. Much later, on the seventeenth anniversary of the uprising, the former chairman of the Viet Minh Committee of the south, Tran Van Giau, cited the November 1940 example as a warning to militants to bide their time against Diem's repressions, least a premature uprising in the south be crushed in 1957 as in 1940<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Endless War Fifty Years of Struggle in Vietnam|last=Harrison|first=James Pinckney|publisher=The Free Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-02-914040-6|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/endlesswarfiftyy0000harr/page/79 79\u201380]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/endlesswarfiftyy0000harr/page/79}}</ref>  The principal reasons for these failures were that the communists had insufficient men and arms and that the colonial police and security services had broken into the party's communications networks.<ref name=\":2\" /> The repression was directed by the governor of Indochina, Rivoal and his inspector of political and administrative affairs, Brasey, whose chief aide was Nguyen Van Tam.

First, put all the people captured during the uprising of trial right away. The intention was to scare them but release them, recognizing that if they were badly mistreated, they-or their friends, allies and family-would later seek revenge which would not be advantageous for the revolution. There should be no repeat of the public execution of Constable Trau in 1930. A People's Court was set up, with prosecutors chosen from among the peasants and Party members overseeing the proceedings. All those detained were released after warnings not to repress the revolution if they did return to work for the French. The second decision made by the province leadership was to break open the rice granaries and distribute the rice to the needy. The peasants needed little encouragement In Nhi Binh village, they seized the granaries of Nguyen Thanh Long, a large landlord and Doc Phu Mau in Ngu Hiep, as well as other smaller landlords. It took the peasants three days to cart away the contents of Doc Phu Mau's granary. In Long Trung village, the granary of Ho Khai Khoa was spared because his son aligned himself with the revolution. The third decision of the province leadership was to order the insurrection participants to retreat back into clandestiny, hide their weapons and wait for an order from the Central Committee for a second uprising.<ref name=\":4\" /> Jennings has called the French reaction to the uprising \"repressive\" and has also used terms such as \"repressive\" and \"brutal\", highlighting how serious the uprising was to the French.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vichy\u00a0in the tropics: P\u00e9tain's national revolution in Madagascar, Guadeloupe, and Indochina, 1940-1944|last=Jennings|first=Eric Thomas|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=163}}</ref> Interestingly enough, he also suggests that the event was important in highlighting the need for rural reform as he credits the uprising to the \"diminishing prestige of conservative pro-French patriarchs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vichy\u00a0in the tropics: P\u00e9tain's national revolution in Madagascar, Guadeloupe, and Indochina, 1940-1944|last=Jennings|first=Eric Thomas|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=171}}</ref>\" The Vichy Government seemed to be aware that rural reform was important to Communist ideas.\n\nThe Cochinchina Uprising was a traumatic event but it did not leave as big a mark on My Tho as might have been expected.

It did, of course, result in the temporary breakup of the small band of clandestine organizers. Despite the reports of hundreds or even thousands of participants, and the temporary immobilization of the French authority in much of My Tho province, it seems that the number of core activists was relatively small.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://vnexpress.net/gl/xa-hoi/2010/11/3ba2345e VNExpress: Nh\u1eefng b\u1ee9c \u1ea3nh l\u1ecbch s\u1eed v\u1ec1 cu\u1ed9c Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a]\n*[http://www.ubmttq.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/web/tintuc/default.aspx?cat_id=660&news_id=4446 Cu\u1ed9c Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a n\u0103m x\u01b0a]\n*[http://www.sgu.edu.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1493:khng-b-trng-khi-ngha-nam-k-va-khi-phach-nhng-ngi-ph-n-ven-o&catid=412:vit-tip-truyn-thng-v-vang&Itemid=555 Kh\u1ee7ng b\u1ed1 tr\u1eafng Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a v\u00e0 kh\u00ed ph\u00e1ch nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef ven \u0111\u00f4]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nam K\u1ef3 Kh\u1edfi Ngh\u0129a}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1940]]\n[[Category:1940 protests]]\n[[Category:1940 in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Communist Party of Vietnam]]\n[[Category:History of South Vietnam]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}{{Multiple issues|{{more footnotes|date=December 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}}}\n\n'''Cochinchina uprising''' ('''Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a''')  was an armed [[uprising]] against the French and Japanese by the South Vietnamese (at that time known as [[Cochinchina]]) in 1940, led by the [[Indochinese Communist Party]].\n\n==Historical background==\nIn June 1940, France was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] troops. Taking this opportunity, in September of that year, Japanese imperialists invaded the [[Indochina]] peninsula then colonised by France. From here, Vietnam was dominated by two foreign powers, the French and the Japanese. The Vietnamese appear to have expected Japanese support for the uprising, given the fact that the Japanese had been aiding most other Southeast Asian nations with the hope that they would support the plan for the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. Instead the Vietnamese denounced the Japanese as traitors for not helping them to achieve independence from French colonial rule.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Japan Through Vietnamese Eyes (1905-1945)|journal = Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume = 30|issue = 1|pages = 126\u2013146|last=My-Van|first=Tran|date=March 1999|jstor = 20072109|doi = 10.1017/S0022463400008055}}</ref> With the anti-French sentiment and the imitation of the Bac Son revolutionary, many South Vietnamese provinces revolted against the French and Japanese. In Southern Indochina, the French had to deal with claims from Thailand which, backed by the Japanese, demanded territories situated to the Northwest of Cambodia's [[Tonl\u00e9 Sap|Tonle Sap]] and on the right bank of the [[Mekong|Mekong River]] in Laos. Units of Vietnamese troops were sent to the front to fight the Thais. Some of these units stationed in Saigon decided to rebel against being sent to the front. This plan was part of the program of the Party Committee for Cochin-China which from June 1940 on had actively prepared for an uprising. A plan of action was worked out with the aim of combining the actions of military units in revolt with those of worker and peasant organizations throughout Cochin-China.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vietnam, a long history (Revised edition)|last=Nguyen|first=Khac Vien|publisher=The Gioi Publishers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Hanoi|pages=224\u2013225}}</ref> As it so happened, the French did not go to war with Thailand, and thus they could devote their whole strength against the insurgents and easily decimated the South Vietnamese ICP\u201d. With this, it can be said that the insurgents who carried out the uprising had initially believed that Thailand would involve themselves in the conflict, causing a distraction to the French, which would help them, unfortunately for them, this would not happen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Story Of Vietnam|last=Truong|first=Buu Lam|publisher=Outskirts Press Inc|year=2010|isbn=|location=Denver|pages=183}}</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\nIn March 1940, the Standing Committee of the Party, headed by Mr. [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n T\u1ea7n]], drafted the outline to prepare for sporadic activities in the anti-French movement, and then prepared for armed uprising. Besides, many demonstrations were held during that time.\n\n[[Militia|Self-defense force]]s and guerrillas which directly led by [[V\u00f5 V\u0103n T\u1ea7n]], [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u]] were formed in big factories in Saigon such as Ba Son, FACI, pier, Cho Quan lamp, In rural areas, most communes had a squadron or even a guerrilla platoon.\n\nPopular discontent was on the rise in the South and provided, at least momentarily, an opportunity for the ICP to release its frustration at the events since the previous September. At the root of the unrest in the South was economics. High taxes, a fall in the price of rice, and an increase in unemployment all served to cut the standard of living for the average Vietnamese. Throughout the spring and summer of 1940, peasant riots against French conscription for military service along the Cambodian-Thai border, where the threat of war was high. Peasant protests against conscription took place in several towns and villages throughout the delta.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Communist Road to Power In Vietnam|last=Duiker|first=William J|publisher=Westview Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nAs the wave of discontent in the South rose, the Party's Regional Committee for Cochin China attempted to ride the crest, concentrating its propaganda on peasants and newly drafted Vietnamese troops. Since the restoration of the Party apparatus in Cochin China in the early 1930s, the regional Party organization under the direction of Stalin School graduate Tran Van Giau had possessed a unique degree of autonomy and under Giau's autocratic leadership was somewhat inclined toward making decisions independent of the national party leadership. Now, with almost all members of the ICP central Committee in the South in jail, regional leaders took matters in their own hands and began to plan for a general uprising in response to the decisions reached at the Sixth Plenum the previous November. After the French surrender to Nazi Germany in June, they hastily convened an expanded Party conference in [[M\u1ef9 Tho|My Tho]], deep in the heart of the [[Mekong Delta|Mekong delta]] and agreed to initiate preparations for the insurrection. By autumn, half the indigenous troops in Cochin China were allegedly sympathetic to the Communists, with ICP sources estimating that up to 30 percent of the entire population of the colony was on its side.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAll blacksmiths produced weapons day by day in order to provide ammunition to army. The anti-war movement, combating the soldiers with the slogan \"no soldier, no penny for imperial war\" took place the people and soldiers community. Due to good military service, most of the 15,000 Vietnamese soldiers in the French army stationed in Saigon were willing to co-ordinate the uprising.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[D\u01b0\u01a1ng Trung Qu\u1ed1c]], 2001, Vi\u1ec7t Nam nh\u1eefng s\u1ef1 ki\u1ec7n l\u1ecbch s\u1eed (1919\u20131945), H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, Nh\u00e0 xu\u1ea5t b\u1ea3n Gi\u00e1o d\u1ee5c</ref>\n\n==Development==\nParty leaders in Cochin China, however, were understandably hoping to seek support for the uprising from revolutionary elements elsewhere in the country, and in October they sent [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u]], representative of the Central Committee of the Indochinese Communist Party, to consult with members of the ICP Regional Committee for Tonkin. North Vietnamese delegates had not been able to attend the Sixth Plenum in November 1939 and were thus not well informed about the Central Committee's plans to move toward a general insurrection against French colonial rule.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral members of the regional committee, including [[Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Chinh|Truong Cinh]], Hoang Van Thu, and Hoang Quoc Viet met with [[Phan \u0110\u0103ng L\u01b0u|Phan Dang Luu]] in early November in a suburb of Hanoi. The meeting took place in the immediate aftermath of the abortive revolt in [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|Bac Son]], and its decisions reflected an understandable ambivalence about the possibilities of armed uprising. The session reaffirmed the decision of the Sixth Plenum to begin preparations for a future armed uprising against French power, and it affirmed the contention that, if conditions were favorable, a local uprising could be launched in one area of the country even if Vietnamese society as a whole was not in a revolutionary situation. But it condemned what it considered the mistakes committed at Bac Son. The local leadership at Bac Son, it claimed, did not know how to establish revolutionary power, did not know how to conduct propaganda activities and develop revolutionary strength, and, when the battle was over, did not know how to retreat. The decision to abandon the cities for the countryside was termed an error that weakened the Party's urban base. Then, it said, the Party had lost an opportunity to launch a general uprising after French surrendered in June 1940. Finally, it criticized the new united front as vaguely defined and not sufficiently focused on the worker-peasant alliance. Looking to the future, the plenum concluded that Vietnam was not yet in a directly revolutionary situation, but that the revolution could break out in the form of local uprising where conditions were appropriate, leading the way toward a general uprising that would result in a seizure of power in the country as a whole. In perpetration for that moment, the Committee members called for the conservation of the remnants of the Bac Son forces, which were to be reorganized as guerrilla units, and for a revolutionary base in the [[Vi\u1ec7t B\u1eafc|Viet Bac]] to wait for the appropriate moment to launch an uprising.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Communist Road to Power in Vietnam|last=Duiker|first=William J|publisher=Westview Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201366}}</ref>\n\nGiven the judgments above, it is not surprising that the meeting suspected that conditions for an armed uprising were lacking in the South. Local forces were too small, and units in the Center and the North were in no position to give adequate support. So Phan Dang Luu was informed that an uprising in Cochin China should be postponed until the Central Committee could send a representative to check on the national situation and provide proper leadership. If the uprising should fail in spite of such preparations, the rebels must be prepared to make an orderly retreat and transform the defeated forces into guerrilla units.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe meeting also took steps to reconstitute the ICP Central Committee, which had become nearly defunct as the result of the recent arrest of most of its members in the South. Acting on the authority of the one remaining member, Phan Dang Luu, those in attendance named themselves a new provisional central committee with Truong Cinh serving temporarily as general secretary until new elections could be held. This November meeting of the Regional Committee of Tonkin is thus known in Party histories as the Seventh Plenum of the ICP.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nImmediately after the meeting, Phan Dang Luu returned to Cochin China to give his colleagues the bad news that their comrades in Tonkin did not favor a general uprising. But on the evening of November 22 he was arrested by French police at the railway station in Saigon. Advised in advance of the revolt, the French declared martial law and disarmed all indigenous troops in the area.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the Mekong delta, however, the Regional Committee was growing increasingly restive. With 15,000 in the uprising organization and the rebellious troops increasingly impatient for action, the Regional Committee now decided that it could wait no longer for the return of Phan Dang Luu and decided to schedule the outbreak for the night of November 22\u201323. the uprising was concentrated on several district and provincial capitals throughout the Mekong delta. French military posts were to be attacked, communications links cut, and revolutionary power established at the village level. Attacks took place as scheduled in such delta towns as Soc Trang, Bac Lieu, Tan An, Vinh Long and Can Tho, as well as in rural areas along the edge of the Plain of Reeds. In some areas, the masses seized power, formed revolutionary tribunals to punish class enemies, and raised flags in the name of the National United Front. These were plans for an attack on Saigon as well, but the French prevented disturbances by confiscating weapons and blocking entrances to the city.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe course of the insurrection can be divided into three periods. The first period was from 22 to 30 November which was the most intense period of the insurgency. The second was from 30 to 13 December when the insurrection spread to the region of the inter-provincial committee of [[Long Xuy\u00ean|Long Xuyen]] and to [[R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1|Rach Gia]] and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau|Bac Lieu]]. The final period from 12 to 31 December is centered on the Poulo-Obi incident in Bac Lieu<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title=The Indochinese Communist Party and the Nam Ky Uprising in Cochin China November December 1940|journal = South East Asia Research|volume = 5|issue = 3|pages = 269\u2013293|last=Chonchirdsim|first=Sud|date=November 1997|jstor = 23746947|doi = 10.1177/0967828X9700500304}}</ref>\n\nThe revolutionary governments were existed in very short time, the longest one in My Tho was about 49 days. French colonialists vehemently oppressed, seeking to destroy the revolutionary government. It was during this uprising that the flag of North Vietnam was raised at [[Cao L\u00e3nh (city)|Cao Lanh]] in the western delta.

The attacks started at 10 pm on the 22nd of November. The success of the insurrection in Gia Dinh My Tho and Can Tho on 22 and 23 November persuaded ICP insurgents in other provinces to fight. As a result, from 23 November, the insurrection spread to many provinces, even though by that time the government had started to retaliate by using all its force to suppress the rebellion.  These included aerial bombardment and the leveling of many villages. However, the government was not able to stop the uprising in the provinces. Village notables were the main targets of the attacks because they were representatives of the colonial administration of the village level. Even though their administrative power was very limited, they were still the liaison between the colonial administration and the peasants.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The 30 November-13 December period ===\nThis was the period where the insurrection in Gia Dinh, My Tho and Can Tho became less intense and the ICP was on the defensive but when fighting broke out in the inter-provincial region of Long Xuyen. Communist insurgents in that region were in disarray due to the repressive measures of the government, and were not able to rise at the same time as their comrades in other areas even though they received the insurrection order on 22 November. The ICP in this region lost a good opportunity, given that the Inter-Provincial Committee of Long Xuyen was very active in preparing the insurrection. The Long Xuyen Committee ordered its party members to manufacture arms and ammunition in September, and that in October it asked the Cochin China Committee to send instructors to teach tactics to the guerrilla groups newly formed by the Committee. Moreover, the Far West region had serious peasants problems in the second half of the 1930s which would have been an important factor if the ICP were to win over the masses should the insurrection have taken place as originally planned.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe main targets were the three town centres and their suburbs. Strategic targets such as post offices, police stations and ferries were included in the attack plans. Due to bad communications between party members and the arrest of important members of the party, the provinces of Rach Gia and Bac Lieu remained calm during this period, even though Rach Gia was the first province able to form an insurrection group, in September 1940, Ben Tre also saw only small-scale fighting during this period.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The 13\u201331 December Period ===\nThe high point of this period was the attack on Poulo Obi lighthouse in [[C\u00e0 Mau|Ca Mau]] district on 13 and 14 December which cost the life of M Olivier, A French lighthouse keeper. By the second half of December, the insurrection had lost momentum and was dying down. In most areas the ICP had to retreat, and the insurgents were only able to distribute tracts or threaten village notables but no serious attacks were undertaken. In Gia Dinh, as well as in Tan An and the Plain of Reeds, the insurgents had to retreat to the dense forests to avoid being hunted down by the authorities. According to a French report, by mid-December, the government was able to control the situation. Thousands of villages who had fled during the insurrection started to return to their homes. Schools reopened and confidence in the French authorities among the Vietnamese was gradually revived. By the end of the year, the insurrection had completely died down.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Class distinction during the uprising ===\nThe picture of solidarity between the revolutionaries and the rich peasants is contradicted by another account of the period, that the revolutionaries destroyed the crops of some rich peasants and well-off middle peasants who possessed a lot of land. A poor peasant whose resentment of the wealthier classes in his village still burned bright in 1971 said that in the pre-1945 period village officials had to be at least middle peasants, and that middle peasants were allied to the landlords and with the hamlet and village te or officials. Village officials were not without their own influence and support against the insurrection, but it was usually not enough to stem the tide. In the market town of Tan Hiep, the village chief had gathered 200 villagers to support the soldiers in the post against the large crown of peasants insurrectionists sweeping through the area. When the crowd approached, however, the villagers all fled, leaving the village officials and militia to cope with the situation. As during the \u201cVietnam War\u201d period, loyalty to the authority structure did not always extend to defending it to the death, and there was often an asymmetry of commitment between the followers of the opposing sides.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=The Vietnamese War Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta 1930-1975 Volume 1|last=Elliott|first=David W.P|publisher=ME Sharpe|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=39}}</ref>\n\nThe class categories mentioned in later accounts by witnesses of the 1940 Cochinchina Uprising and the August 1945 revolution were assigned only later, during the land reform after 1945. several interview sources assert that there was little or no awareness of class labels at this time, but only a general awareness of a great divide between the minority of the rich and the majority of the poor in their province. The social and economic dominance of a small number of large landholders and the very high percentage of the rural population who were poor and landless peasants make it easy to see why the simple rich-poor categorization of provincial society was prevalent at the time. It is also clear, however, that almost all observers of these events had little difficulty in retrospectively identifying the different socioeconomic positions of the protagonists of social conflict in the 1930s in terms of the more highly differentiated class categories of a later period, even though the exact designations and terminology may have been applied retrospectively.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe seems to have been a case of a new analytic framework so exactly fitting the reality of the times that it seemed always to have been true. Everyone knew, for example, that landlords were people who owned more land than was necessary to support their families, and that they did not work the land but rented it out. Rich peasants were a less distinct category but it was generally understood that they were in essence small landlords who owned less land but still more than they needed for bare survival, who farmed what they could themselves but hired laborers or rented what they could not work to tenants. Middle peasants were self-sufficient owner-cultivators who owned just enough land to support their families, and who worked it themselves. Poor peasants may have owned a bit of land but not enough to support a family. Typically, they were tenants who rented a specified piece of land from one of the large landholders. Very poor peasants were landless peasants who worked as occasional hired laborers, usually in a depressed labor market. Although these class categories were more elaborately defined during the subsequent land reform period, they were simple and serviceable ways to describe the social reality of the 1930s and 1940s and were used consistently by both interviewees and written sources.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Vietnamese War Revolution And Social Change in the Mekong Delta 1930-1975 Volume 1|last=Elliott|first=David WP|publisher=ME Sharpe|year=2003|isbn=|location=New York|pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\nThe French response was swift. In Saigon an attempted uprising was quelled in a day; in the delta, unrest dragged on and was finally put down in early December. Unlike their counterparts in the Viet Bac, the rebels were unable to preserve their forces by retreating to isolated areas, and their defeat signaled the temporary collapse of the Party in Cochin China.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Communist movement in the south was gravely set back after the suppression of the 1940 uprising, an upsurge of the Hoa Hao movement taking advantage of the new situation.

First, put all the people captured during the uprising of trial right away. The intention was to scare them but release them, recognizing that if they were badly mistreated, they-or their friends, allies and family-would later seek revenge which would not be advantageous for the revolution. There should be no repeat of the public execution of Constable Trau in 1930. A People's Court was set up, with prosecutors chosen from among the peasants and Party members overseeing the proceedings. All those detained were released after warnings not to repress the revolution if they did return to work for the French. The second decision made by the province leadership was to break open the rice granaries and distribute the rice to the needy. The peasants needed little encouragement In Nhi Binh village, they seized the granaries of Nguyen Thanh Long, a large landlord and Doc Phu Mau in Ngu Hiep, as well as other smaller landlords. It took the peasants three days to cart away the contents of Doc Phu Mau's granary. In Long Trung village, the granary of Ho Khai Khoa was spared because his son aligned himself with the revolution. The third decision of the province leadership was to order the insurrection participants to retreat back into clandestiny, hide their weapons and wait for an order from the Central Committee for a second uprising.<ref name=\":4\" /> Jennings has called the French reaction to the uprising \u201crepressive\u201d and has also used terms such as \u201crepressive\u201d and \u201cbrutal\u201d, highlighting how serious the uprising was to the French.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vichy\u00a0in the tropics: P\u00e9tain's national revolution in Madagascar, Guadeloupe, and Indochina, 1940-1944|last=Jennings|first=Eric Thomas|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=163}}</ref> Interestingly enough, he also suggests that the event was important in highlighting the need for rural reform as he credits the uprising to the \u201cdiminishing prestige of conservative pro-French patriarchs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vichy\u00a0in the tropics: P\u00e9tain's national revolution in Madagascar, Guadeloupe, and Indochina, 1940-1944|last=Jennings|first=Eric Thomas|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=171}}</ref>\u201d The Vichy Government seemed to be aware that rural reform was important to Communist ideas.\n\nThe Cochinchina Uprising was a traumatic event but it did not leave as big a mark on My Tho as might have been expected. The event does not feature prominently in revolutionary historiography because it was judged to be a rash and premature act, taken without authorization from the Party's top leadership. It did, of course, result in the temporary breakup of the small band of clandestine organizers. Despite the reports of hundreds or even thousands of participants, and the temporary immobilization of the French authority in much of My Tho province, it seems that the number of core activists was relatively small.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://vnexpress.net/gl/xa-hoi/2010/11/3ba2345e VNExpress: Nh\u1eefng b\u1ee9c \u1ea3nh l\u1ecbch s\u1eed v\u1ec1 cu\u1ed9c Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a]\n*[http://www.ubmttq.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/web/tintuc/default.aspx?cat_id=660&news_id=4446 Cu\u1ed9c Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a n\u0103m x\u01b0a]\n*[http://www.sgu.edu.vn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1493:khng-b-trng-khi-ngha-nam-k-va-khi-phach-nhng-ngi-ph-n-ven-o&catid=412:vit-tip-truyn-thng-v-vang&Itemid=555 Kh\u1ee7ng b\u1ed1 tr\u1eafng Nam K\u1ef3 kh\u1edfi ngh\u0129a v\u00e0 kh\u00ed ph\u00e1ch nh\u1eefng ng\u01b0\u1eddi ph\u1ee5 n\u1eef ven \u0111\u00f4]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nam K\u1ef3 Kh\u1edfi Ngh\u0129a}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1940]]\n[[Category:1940 protests]]\n[[Category:1940 in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Communist Party of Vietnam]]\n[[Category:History of South Vietnam]]\n", "name_user": "Dl2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix quot; tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940_Cochinchina_uprising"}

{"title_page": "List of DC Comics publications (P\u2013S)", "text_new": "'''[[DC Comics]]''' is one of the largest [[comic book]] publishers in [[North America]]. DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the [[DC Universe]] characters and continuity, such as [[Elseworlds]] and [[DC Black Label]]. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as [[List of Vertigo publications|Vertigo]] or [[List of Wildstorm titles|WildStorm]]; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed.\n\nWhile generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, ''Action Comics'' has frequently been listed as ''Action Comics featuring Superman'' or ''Superman in Action Comics'', or even on occasion ''Supergirl in Action Comics''. The official name, however, is found in the indicia, in small print inside the comics.\n\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (A\u2013B)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (C\u2013F)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (G\u2013J)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (K\u2013O)]]\n*[[List of DC Comics publications (T\u2013Z)]]\n\n==P==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!width=22%| Title\n!width=10%| Series\n!width=14%| Issues\n!width=22%| Dates\n!width=32%| Notes\n!Reference\n|-\n| ''Parallax: Emerald Night''\n|\n| #1\n| Nov 1996\n| One-shot\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Pat Boone]]''\n|\n| #1\u20135\n| Sep/Oct 1959 \u2013 May/Jun 1960\n|\n|\n|-\n| ''[[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]]''\n|\n| #1\u20134\n| Jan 1988 \u2013 Apr 1988\n| Limited series.

DC has published comic books under a number of different imprints and corporate names. This is a list of all series, mini-series, limited series, one-shots and graphic novels published under the imprints DC or AA, and published by National Periodical Publications, National Comics Publications, All-American Comics, Inc., National Allied Publications, Detective Comics, Inc., and related corporate names, as well as imprints publishing titles directly related to the [[DC Universe]] characters and continuity, such as [[Elseworlds]] and [[DC Black Label]]. The list does not include collected editions; trade paperbacks; digital comics; free, promotional giveaways; or magazines, nor does it include series from imprints mainly publishing titles that are separate from the DC Universe continuity, such as [[List of Vertigo publications|Vertigo]] or [[List of Wildstorm titles|WildStorm]]; series published under those imprints that are related to the DC Universe continuity are noted, but not listed.\n\nWhile generally the most recognizable name of a comic is printed on the cover, the cover title can be changed for a number of reasons. For example, ''Action Comics'' has frequently been listed as ''Action Comics featuring Superman'' or ''Superman in Action Comics'', or even on occasion ''Supergirl in Action Comics''.

He named the new printing office the \"Museum\" (like Valvasor before him), and printed the first books in [[Latin]] and in [[Croatian language|Croatian]].\n\nThe printing house was in operation between 1695 and 1706, and his best known work ''[[Croatia Rediviva]]'' (\"Croatia Revived\") was printed there in 1700. On 14 June 1706, the press was largely destroyed in a great fire, and Vitezovi\u0107's wife died two years later, rendering him entirely distraught.<ref name=\"moljac\"/>\n\nIn 1710 he moved to Vienna, where he continued to publish, and was awarded an honorary title of a baron at the Austrian court.

They also describe him as the most visionary and complete Croatian author of his time. In his literary works, he was traditional and innovative on one hand drawing parallels with [[Ignjat \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107]], and on the other strove to bring his books to the masses and those less educated, which brought him closer to the [[Age of Enlightenment]].
