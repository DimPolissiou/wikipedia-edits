At the height of his wealth, from the 1950s to his death in the early 1970s, his portfolio was estimated to be $850 million American dollars, which would translate to more than $9 billion American dollars today. \nMadrigal died at home in New Manila, Quezon City, under the care of his youngest daughter, Maria Luisa.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1880, Vicente Madrigal grew up in [[Ligao|Ligao, Albay]]. He was the only son of Jos\u00e9 Maria Madrigal, who emigrated from [[Barcelona, Spain]], a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] migrant and former soldier, and Macaria L\u00f3pez y Pardo de Tavera, a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[mestiza]]. Macaria was one of two natural daughters of Joaquin [[Pardo de Tavera]] who lived in [[Albay]] as a bachelor prior to his marriage to Gertrudis Gorricho, a wealthy heiress.\n\nGrowing up in meager circumstances in remote provinces, he dreamt of owning his own shipping fleet. When the monsoon rains came, he created paper boats. His mother, nicknamed Nena, teased him that his paper boats would not take him too far away and his reply was always that one day he would take his mom and dad away on his real ship across the seas to visit Spain, his father's dying wish.\n\nHe studied at [[San Juan de Letran|Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], a [[Manila]] college known for its roster of half-Spanish Filipinos and for its location in the walled city of [[Intramuros]], once the regional bastion of Spanish power. With his father depending on a small pension, the family exploited its military connections with the Escuela Nautica who were close with the friars who owned San Juan de Letran. He graduated with the highest honors. His closest college classmates were future Presidents [[Manuel Luis Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], who were themselves poor relatives of rich families.\n\nWhile in Manila, he came face-to-face with the staggering wealth of his maternal grandfather's family, that of Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and the Gorricho real estate portfolio spanning the Escolta and the ancestral house of the Gorricho-Pardo de Tavera. He was determined to match or even surpass the huge wealth of his Manila relatives, who did not recognize that he, his mother and his aunt existed.\n\n==Business career==\nMadrigal established large businesses in coal, oil, sugar, cement, shipping and real estate.\n\nIn the shipping business, his Madrigal Steamship Company did not begin to return profits until after his mother's death, frustrating his childhood dream of bringing his parents to Spain.  He settled for treating his sister Rosario to an extended vacation aboard a Madrigal ship to Barcelona.\n\nIn the cement business, he acquired his Rizal Cement Corporation after the heirs of the Spanish-Filipino family Ynchausti y Compania lost life and limb while helping fellow [[Basque people|Basque]]s in Spain.\n\nIn the coal business, Madrigal was criticized by contemporaries and modern commentators for having engaged in [[war profiteering]], supplying coal to the Japanese navy during its [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupation of the Philippines]] between 1942 and 1945. It appears{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} that he did so under duress, as he was known{{to whom?|date=January 2016}} to be patriotic and the approximately one million pesos he made in profit was a far smaller amount than he would have made by closing operations during the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Madrigal attributed this situation to the loss of the good luck that his wife Susana brought to his life, for she died a few months before the war began and left him a widower raising five girls and two boys.\n\nMadrigal was a close friend of [[Manuel Luis Quezon]], Commonwealth President of the country and a former classmate. He used this connection to acquire certificates to refineries from bankrupt Spanish-Filipino families, whose business had been devastated by the transfer of the Philippines from Spanish to American control. This allowed Madrigal to expand into the commodities market, selling sugar and palm oil, as well as claiming real estate, which he primarily disposed of to increase his shares in growing companies. The remainder he gave to his wife, who managed the properties successfully.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHe married Susana Paterno y Ramos, who grew up in [[Pangil, Laguna]] and was a poor relation to her own Manila relatives, the Paternos of Quiapo and [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n\nShe was a dressmaker to the prominent Cuyugan and Catigbac families, established a jewelry shop with the Salgado family of Pampanga, and dabbled in real estate. Before the war she acquired a {{convert|11000|ha}} hacienda in [[Canlubang]], Laguna. She was responsible for the purchase of the Madrigal property where the old Jai Alai fronton used to stand, as well as buildings near her aunts' mansions on Calle Hidalgo, [[Quiapo, Manila]] and its adjacent streets. She urged her husband to invest in Hacienda de Mandaluyong even when her husband did not agree to be a major investor without control of the partnership built by Francisco Ortigas Jr. Susana foresaw that upon her husband's eventual divestment, the Ortigas clan would have to surrender large chunks of their property in payment. That property became what is now known as Corinthian Gardens and Arcadia Village in [[Pasig]] where even a small lot commands millions today. She obtained lots in Wack-Wack Golf Club which eventually devolved to her daughter Josefina. Further, she recognized the possibilities of [[Alabang]]. Today, [[Ayala Alabang]]'s mango trees are her visible legacies in the mini-city, which features schools, [[Madrigal Business Park]], and even a Polo field named after the family.\n\nHer descendants receive rents from the centrally located commercial real estate properties she acquired. In contrast, Vicente preferred non-real estate investments. He was frightened at how agricultural holdings like haciendas owned by great Spanish families in the Philippines remained idle, or worse, were confiscated or expropriated ''ad absentia'' by the government or unscrupulous ''encargados''.\n\nUpon the deaths of her Paterno aunts she and her brothers Simon and Jose inherited the old, beautiful Paterno mansions.\n\nTheir children were Macaria (de Leon), Paz (Warns, later Gonzalez) who served as senator from 1955 until 1961, Josefina (Bayot), Antonio and Jose married to sisters Amanda Abad Santos and Victoria Abad Santos respectively, Consuelo Alejandra (Vazquez later Collantes) and Maria Luisa (Vazquez, his brother's marriage to Consuelo Alejandra having been annulled).\n\nMadrigal's wealth was equally divided among his seven offspring.\n\nHe is the grandfather of former Senator [[Jamby Madrigal]].\n\n==Illegitimacy scandal==\nAs Madrigal rose in wealth, the opposite happened to the Pardo de Tavera family. After the flamboyant Crystal Arcade venture of [[Andres Luna San Pedro]] (son of [[Juan Luna]] and Paz Pardo de Tavera), one of the heirs and grandnephews of his grandfather Joaquin, the Pardo de Tavera holding firm could no longer service its mounting debts. In a desperate move, Madrigal was named as respondent by Pardo de Tavera, seeking to nullify the Motion to Foreclose by its creditor [[El Hogar Filipino Building|El Hogar Filipino]], on the basis that he signed some of the papers involved in the loan.<!-- what's the scandal?--> Madrigal did not know that money he loaned to El Hogar Filipino was used by the firm to facilitate a loan to the Pardo de Tavera family, and neither did El Hogar Filipino knew that Madrigal and the Pardo de Taveras were related by blood illegitimately. This caused a scandal among business circles at that time, although, in deference to other involved families including the Legarda and Roces clans, no specific accounts were published in the leading newspapers. This is also the reason why afterwards Madrigal distanced himself from El Hogar Filipino. When its headquarters in [[Escolta]] was set up for sale at a heavy discount, he refused to buy the property.\n\n==Political career==\nMadrigal won  [[1941 Philippine general election|1941 Senate Election]] under the banner of [[Nacionalista Party]] of [[Incumbent]] [[Manuel L. Quezon|President Manuel L. Quezon]]. His wife had died a few months before his victory, in 1941.\n\nHe forbade his daughters from returning to Manila, fearing the Japanese.  They remained in Washington, DC and New York, continuing their studies or furthering their careers in Diplomatic Service.\n\nThe [[1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines Congress]] opened its session on June 9, 1945 but Madrigal was not able to serve due to charges of Collaboration.  He had been part of the [[Second Philippine Republic|Japanese-sponsored government]] of [[Jose P. Laurel]] together with senators [[Claro M. Recto]], [[Eulogio A. Rodriguez Sr.]], [[Emiliano Tria Tirona]], [[Quintin Paredes]], [[Prospero Sebastian]], [[Antonio de las Alas]] and [[Jose Yulo]] who was appointed Chief Justice during the war.\n\nWhen [[Manuel Roxas]] was elected president on 1946, Madrigal, together with other collaborators, was pardoned. He was re-elected in 1947 under the banner of [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. He ran again in 1953 but was unsuccessful.\n\nHe later sponsored his second oldest daughter Pacita Madrigal, who won handily during [[Ramon Magsaysay]]'s presidency.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1992, a public school in [[Binangonan]], [[Rizal]] was built and was named after him, the [[Vicente Madrigal National High School|Vicente Madrigal Municipal High School]]. Binangonan was once a stop-over point for Susana, who lived on the other side of the [[Laguna de Bay]] in [[Pangil]] prior to marrying Madrigal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vicente Madrigal National High School]]\n*[[Jamby Madrigal]]\n*[[Spanish Filipino]]\n*[[Ligao|Ligao, Albay]]\n*[[Liberal Party of the Philippines]]\n*[[Nacionalista Party]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Madrigal, Vicente}}\n[[Category:1880 births]]\n[[Category:1972 deaths]]\n[[Category:Filipino businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Filipino collaborators with Imperial Japan]]\n[[Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni]]\n[[Category:Senators of the 2nd Congress of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Senators of the 1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:People from Albay]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (Philippines) politicians]]\n[[Category:Nacionalista Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Filipino people of Spanish descent]]\n[[Category:Senators of the 1st Congress of the Philippines]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=January 2016}}\n{{more citations needed|bio|date=January 2017}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox Senator\n| honorific-prefix = [[The Honourable]]\n| honorific_suffix = \n| name                = Vicente Mar\u00eda Epifanio <br/> Madrigal-L\u00f3pez\n| image               = \n| imagesize           =\n| smallimage          =\n| caption             =\n| order               = \n| office              = [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator of the Philippines]]\n| term_start          = December 30, 1945<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/senlist.asp#Commonwealth|quote= \"Although its members were elected in November 1941, this body was convoked only in June 1945, with only 16 members in attendance, for the rest had either died or had been detained on charges of collaboration with the Japanese.\"|title=List of Previous Senators}}</ref>\n| term_end            = December 30, 1953\n| birth_date          = {{birth date|1880|04|05}}\n| birth_place         = [[Gumaca, Quezon]], [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]]\n| death_date          = {{death date and age|1972|6|6|1880|4|5}}\n| death_place         = New Manila, [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]\n| nationality         = [[Filipino people|Filipino]]\n| party               = [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal]] <small>(1947-1953)</small>\n| otherparty          = [[Nacionalista Party|Nacionalista]] <small>(1941-1947)</small>\n| spouse              = Susana Paterno Ramos\n| relations           = \n| children            = Macaria, [[Pacita Madrigal-Warns|Paz]], Josefina, Antonio, Jose, Consuelo and Maria Luisa\n| alma_mater          = [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]]\n| occupation          = Businessman, Senator\n| religion            = Catholic\n}}\n\n'''Vicente Mar\u00eda Epifanio Madrigal L\u00f3pez y Pardo de Tavera''' (April 5, 1880 \u2013 June 6, 1972) was a successful [[Spanish Filipino]] business tycoon, industrialist and politician.  At the height of his wealth, from the 1950s to his death in the early 1970s, his portfolio was estimated to be $850 million American dollars, which would translate to more than $9 billion American dollars today. \nMadrigal died at home in New Manila, Quezon City, under the care of his youngest daughter, Maria Luisa.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in 1880, Vicente Madrigal grew up in [[Ligao|Ligao, Albay]]. He was the only son of Jos\u00e9 Maria Madrigal, who emigrated from [[Barcelona, Spain]], a [[Catalan people|Catalan]] migrant and former soldier, and Macaria L\u00f3pez y Pardo de Tavera, a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[mestiza]]. Macaria was one of two natural daughters of Joaquin [[Pardo de Tavera]] who lived in [[Albay]] as a bachelor prior to his marriage to Gertrudis Gorricho, a wealthy heiress.\n\nGrowing up in meager circumstances in remote provinces, he dreamt of owning his own shipping fleet. When the monsoon rains came, he created paper boats. His mother, nicknamed Nena, teased him that his paper boats would not take him too far away and his reply was always that one day he would take his mom and dad away on his real ship across the seas to visit Spain, his father's dying wish.\n\nHe studied at [[San Juan de Letran|Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], a [[Manila]] college known for its roster of half-Spanish Filipinos and for its location in the walled city of [[Intramuros]], once the regional bastion of Spanish power. With his father depending on a small pension, the family exploited its military connections with the Escuela Nautica who were close with the friars who owned San Juan de Letran. He graduated with the highest honors. His closest college classmates were future Presidents [[Manuel Luis Quezon]] and [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], who were themselves poor relatives of rich families.\n\nWhile in Manila, he came face-to-face with the staggering wealth of his maternal grandfather's family, that of Joaquin Pardo de Tavera and the Gorricho real estate portfolio spanning the Escolta and the ancestral house of the Gorricho-Pardo de Tavera. He was determined to match or even surpass the huge wealth of his Manila relatives, who did not recognize that he, his mother and his aunt existed.\n\n==Business career==\nMadrigal established large businesses in coal, oil, sugar, cement, shipping and real estate.\n\nIn the shipping business, his Madrigal Steamship Company did not begin to return profits until after his mother's death, frustrating his childhood dream of bringing his parents to Spain.  He settled for treating his sister Rosario to an extended vacation aboard a Madrigal ship to Barcelona.\n\nIn the cement business, he acquired his Rizal Cement Corporation after the heirs of the Spanish-Filipino family Ynchausti y Compania lost life and limb while helping fellow [[Basque people|Basque]]s in Spain.\n\nIn the coal business, Madrigal was criticized by contemporaries and modern commentators for having engaged in [[war profiteering]], supplying coal to the Japanese navy during its [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupation of the Philippines]] between 1942 and 1945. It appears{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} that he did so under duress, as he was known{{to whom?|date=January 2016}} to be patriotic and the approximately one million pesos he made in profit was a far smaller amount than he would have made by closing operations during the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Madrigal attributed this situation to the loss of the good luck that his wife Susana brought to his life, for she died a few months before the war began and left him a widower raising five girls and two boys.\n\nMadrigal was a close friend of [[Manuel Luis Quezon]], Commonwealth President of the country and a former classmate. He used this connection to acquire certificates to refineries from bankrupt Spanish-Filipino families, whose business had been devastated by the transfer of the Philippines from Spanish to American control. This allowed Madrigal to expand into the commodities market, selling sugar and palm oil, as well as claiming real estate, which he primarily disposed of to increase his shares in growing companies. The remainder he gave to his wife, who managed the properties successfully.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nHe married Susana Paterno y Ramos, who grew up in [[Pangil, Laguna]] and was a poor relation to her own Manila relatives, the Paternos of Quiapo and [[Santa Cruz, Manila]].\n\nShe was a dressmaker to the prominent Cuyugan and Catigbac families, established a jewelry shop with the Salgado family of Pampanga, and dabbled in real estate. Before the war she acquired a {{convert|11000|ha}} hacienda in [[Canlubang]], Laguna. She was responsible for the purchase of the Madrigal property where the old Jai Alai fronton used to stand, as well as buildings near her aunts' mansions on Calle Hidalgo, [[Quiapo, Manila]] and its adjacent streets. She urged her husband to invest in Hacienda de Mandaluyong even when her husband did not agree to be a major investor without control of the partnership built by Francisco Ortigas Jr. Susana foresaw that upon her husband's eventual divestment, the Ortigas clan would have to surrender large chunks of their property in payment. That property became what is now known as Corinthian Gardens and Arcadia Village in [[Pasig]] where even a small lot commands millions today. She obtained lots in Wack-Wack Golf Club which eventually devolved to her daughter Josefina. Further, she recognized the possibilities of [[Alabang]]. Today, [[Ayala Alabang]]'s mango trees are her visible legacies in the mini-city, which features schools, [[Madrigal Business Park]], and even a Polo field named after the family.\n\nHer descendants receive rents from the centrally located commercial real estate properties she acquired. In contrast, Vicente preferred non-real estate investments. He was frightened at how agricultural holdings like haciendas owned by great Spanish families in the Philippines remained idle, or worse, were confiscated or expropriated ''ad absentia'' by the government or unscrupulous ''encargados''.\n\nUpon the deaths of her Paterno aunts she and her brothers Simon and Jose inherited the old, beautiful Paterno mansions.\n\nTheir children were Macaria (de Leon), Paz (Warns, later Gonzalez) who served as senator from 1955 until 1961, Josefina (Bayot), Antonio and Jose married to sisters Amanda Abad Santos and Victoria Abad Santos respectively, Consuelo Alejandra (Vazquez later Collantes) and Maria Luisa (Vazquez, his brother's marriage to Consuelo Alejandra having been annulled).\n\nMadrigal's wealth was equally divided among his seven offspring.\n\nHe is the grandfather of former Senator [[Jamby Madrigal]].\n\n==Illegitimacy scandal==\nAs Madrigal rose in wealth, the opposite happened to the Pardo de Tavera family.

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]] ruled by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]]. From the [[constitutional reforms of Augustus| accession of Caesar Augustus]] to the [[military Anarchy| military anarchy of the third century]], it was a [[roman principate| principate]] with [[Roman Italy| Italy]] as [[metropole]] of the [[Roman province| provinces]] and its city of [[Rome]] as sole capital (27 BC \u2013 286 AD). Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis, the empire was forcibly reassembled, then ruled by [[dominate| multiple emperors]] who shared rule over the [[Western Roman Empire]] (based in [[Milan]] and later in [[Ravenna]]) and over the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (based in [[Nicomedia]] and later in [[Constantinople]]). Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD, when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ([[Byzantium]] - [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Byz\u00e1ntion'')  following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of [[Odoacer]] and the subsequent deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]]. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to [[barbarian kingdoms| Germanic kings]], along with the [[hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire]] into the [[Byzantine Empire]], conventionally marks the end of [[Ancient Rome]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe predecessor state of the Roman Empire, the [[Roman Republic]] (which had replaced [[Roman Kingdom |Rome's monarchy]] in the 6th century BC) became severely destabilized in a series of [[Roman civil wars| civil wars]] and political conflicts. In the mid-1st century BC [[Julius Caesar]] was appointed as perpetual [[Roman dictator| dictator]] and then [[Assassination of Julius Caesar| assassinated]] in 44 BC. Civil wars and [[proscriptions]] continued, culminating in [[Final War of the Roman Republic |the victory]] of [[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son, over [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. The following year Octavian [[Roman Egypt| conquered]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], ending the [[Hellenistic period]] that had begun with the [[Wars of Alexander the Great| conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]] in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power then became unassailable, and in 27 BC the [[Roman Senate]] formally granted him [[imperium| overarching power]] and the new title [[Augustus (honorific)| ''Augustus'']], effectively making him [[List of Roman emperors |the first Roman emperor]].\n\nThe [[History of the Roman Empire |first two centuries of the Empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] (\"Roman Peace\"). Rome reached its greatest [[Borders of the Roman Empire| territorial expanse]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117 AD). A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of [[Commodus]] (177-192). In the 3rd century the Empire [[Crisis of the Third Century|underwent a crisis]] that threatened its existence, as the [[Gallic Empire]] and [[Palmyrene Empire]] broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [[Barracks emperor| short-lived emperors]], often from the legions, led the empire. The empire was reunified under [[Aurelian]] ({{reign | 270 | 275}}). In an effort to stabilize the Empire, [[Diocletian]] set up two different imperial courts in the [[Greek East and Latin West]] in 286. [[State church of the Roman Empire| Christians rose to positions of power]] in the 4th century following the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313. Shortly after, the [[Migration Period]], involving large invasions by [[Germanic-Roman contacts| Germanic peoples]] and by the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]], led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire| decline of the Western Roman Empire]]. With the [[fall of Ravenna]] to the [[Heruli| Germanic Herulians]] and the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus |deposition]] of [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476 AD by [[Odoacer]], the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed \u2013 the (Eastern Roman) Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] formally abolished it in [[480 AD]]. Nonetheless, some states in the territories of the former Western Roman Empire would later claim to have inherited the supreme power of the emperors of Rome, most notably the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, identified by modern historians under the name of the [[History of the Byzantine Empire| Byzantine Empire]], survived for another millennium until the Empire's last remains collapsed when [[Fall of Constantinople| Constantinople fell]] to the [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman Turks]] of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453.<ref group=\"n\">The Ottomans sometimes called their state the \"Empire of [[R\u00fbm]]\" ({{lang-ota|\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0646\u0625\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0645|lit= Exalted State of Rome}}). In this sense, it could be argued that a \"Roman\" Empire survived until the early-20th century.

This was the period of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic]]. Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was briefly perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] before being [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]]. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC by an army led by [[Mark Antony]] and Caesar's adopted son [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, ending the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. In 27 BC the [[Senate and People of Rome]] made Octavian ''[[princeps]]'' (\"first citizen\") with [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'', thus beginning the [[Principate]] (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name \"[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]\" (\"the venerated\"). Though the old [[constitutional]] machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Although the republic stood in name, contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome.<ref>Syme, Ronald (1939) ''The Roman Revolution''.

Such masks were occasionally also specific to a particular role, and an actor could then play multiple roles merely by switching masks. Female roles were played by men in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] (''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'').

The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are however unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally staged readings to full production pageants. More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying ''mimus'' theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqu\u00e9 language and jokes, sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance numbers, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and [[dancing bear]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4350348  |jstor=4350348  |title=Mime: The Missing Link in Roman Literary History  |journal=The Classical World  |volume=82  |issue=3  |pages=153\u2013163  |year=1989  |last1=Fantham  |first1=R.

They might have launched a major effort to suppress pagan learning as a danger to the Church and its doctrines.\nBut they did not. Why not? \nPerhaps it was in the slow dissemination of Christianity. After four centuries as members of a distinct religion, Christians had learned to live with Greek secular learning and to utilize it for their own benefit. Their education was heavily infiltrated by Latin and Greek pagan literature and philosophy\u2026 Although Christians found certain aspects of pagan culture and learning unacceptable, they did not view them as a cancer to be cut out of the Christian body.<ref>Grant, Edvard.

Vergil wrote the ''[[Aeneid]]'', creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together [[Greco-Roman mythology]] from the [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|creation of the universe]] to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification of Julius Caesar]]. Ovid's versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became one of the primary sources of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was so influential in the [[medieval literature|Middle Ages]] that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the \"Age of Ovid.\"<ref>''Aetas Ovidiana''; Charles McNelis, \"Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 397.</ref>\n\nThe principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] and early history became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. [[Vitruvius]]'s book ''[[De Architectura]]'', the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.\n\nLatin writers were immersed in the [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary tradition]], and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]]. The [[satires of Juvenal|poetry of Juvenal]] offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.\n\nThe period from the mid-1st century through the mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature. Under Nero, disillusioned writers reacted to Augustanism.<ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 8.</ref> The three leading writers\u2014[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, dramatist, and tutor of Nero; [[Lucan]], his nephew, who turned [[Caesar's civil war]] into [[Pharsalia|an epic poem]]; and the novelist [[Petronius]] ''([[Satyricon]])''\u2014all committed suicide after incurring the emperor's displeasure.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining good relations with the gods ''([[pax deorum]])''. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', \"the way of the ancestors\" or \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity. There was no principle analogous to \"[[separation of church and state]]\". The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same social pool of men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.\n\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', \"I give that you might give.\" Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.<ref name=r4>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. [[Apuleius]] (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.<ref>[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1</ref><ref>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 279.</ref> The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. [[Vota pro salute rei publicae|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[divus]]'') by vote of the Senate. [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the \"Kaaba of Najran\": \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-'Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; \"Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam\"), Baghdad, 1955\u20131983; P.

The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted (''[[interpretatio romana]]'') within the context of Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced, with its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France). The sanctuary established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.<ref>Fishwick, Duncan (1991).

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]] ruled by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]]. From the [[constitutional reforms of Augustus| accession of Caesar Augustus]] to the [[military Anarchy| military anarchy of the third century]], it was a [[roman principate| principate]] with [[Roman Italy| Italy]] as [[metropole]] of the [[Roman province| provinces]] and its city of [[Rome]] as sole capital (27 BC \u2013 286 AD). Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis, the empire was forcibly reassembled, then ruled by [[dominate| multiple emperors]] who shared rule over the [[Western Roman Empire]] (based in [[Milan]] and later in [[Ravenna]]) and over the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (based in [[Nicomedia]] and later in [[Constantinople]]). Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD, when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ([[Byzantium]] - [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Byz\u00e1ntion'')  following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of [[Odoacer]] and the subsequent deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]]. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to [[barbarian kingdoms| Germanic kings]], along with the [[hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire]] into the [[Byzantine Empire]], conventionally marks the end of [[Ancient Rome]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe predecessor state of the Roman Empire, the [[Roman Republic]] (which had replaced [[Roman Kingdom |Rome's monarchy]] in the 6th century BC) became severely destabilized in a series of [[Roman civil wars| civil wars]] and political conflicts. In the mid-1st century BC [[Julius Caesar]] was appointed as perpetual [[Roman dictator| dictator]] and then [[Assassination of Julius Caesar| assassinated]] in 44 BC. Civil wars and [[proscriptions]] continued, culminating in [[Final War of the Roman Republic |the victory]] of [[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son, over [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. The following year Octavian [[Roman Egypt| conquered]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], ending the [[Hellenistic period]] that had begun with the [[Wars of Alexander the Great| conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]] in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power then became unassailable, and in 27 BC the [[Roman Senate]] formally granted him [[imperium| overarching power]] and the new title [[Augustus (honorific)| ''Augustus'']], effectively making him [[List of Roman emperors |the first Roman emperor]].\n\nThe [[History of the Roman Empire |first two centuries of the Empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] (\"Roman Peace\"). Rome reached its greatest [[Borders of the Roman Empire| territorial expanse]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117 AD). A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of [[Commodus]] (177-192). In the 3rd century the Empire [[Crisis of the Third Century|underwent a crisis]] that threatened its existence, as the [[Gallic Empire]] and [[Palmyrene Empire]] broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [[Barracks emperor| short-lived emperors]], often from the legions, led the empire. The empire was reunified under [[Aurelian]] ({{reign | 270 | 275}}). In an effort to stabilize the Empire, [[Diocletian]] set up two different imperial courts in the [[Greek East and Latin West]] in 286. [[State church of the Roman Empire| Christians rose to positions of power]] in the 4th century following the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313. Shortly after, the [[Migration Period]], involving large invasions by [[Germanic-Roman contacts| Germanic peoples]] and by the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]], led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire| decline of the Western Roman Empire]]. With the [[fall of Ravenna]] to the [[Heruli| Germanic Herulians]] and the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus |deposition]] of [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476 AD by [[Odoacer]], the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed \u2013 the (Eastern Roman) Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] formally abolished it in [[480 AD]]. Nonetheless, some states in the territories of the former Western Roman Empire would later claim to have inherited the supreme power of the emperors of Rome, most notably the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, identified by modern historians under the name of the [[History of the Byzantine Empire| Byzantine Empire]], survived for another millennium until the Empire's last remains collapsed when [[Fall of Constantinople| Constantinople fell]] to the [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman Turks]] of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453.<ref group=\"n\">The Ottomans sometimes called their state the \"Empire of [[R\u00fbm]]\" ({{lang-ota|\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0646\u0625\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0645|lit= Exalted State of Rome}}).

This was the period of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic]]. Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was briefly perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] before being [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]]. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC by an army led by [[Mark Antony]] and Caesar's adopted son [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, ending the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. In 27 BC the [[Senate and People of Rome]] made Octavian ''[[princeps]]'' (\"first citizen\") with [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'', thus beginning the [[Principate]] (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name \"[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]\" (\"the venerated\"). Though the old [[constitutional]] machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Although the republic stood in name, contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome.<ref>Syme, Ronald (1939) ''The Roman Revolution''.

Such masks were occasionally also specific to a particular role, and an actor could then play multiple roles merely by switching masks. Female roles were played by men in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] (''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'').

The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are however unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally staged readings to full production pageants. More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying ''mimus'' theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqu\u00e9 language and jokes, sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance numbers, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and [[dancing bear]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4350348  |jstor=4350348  |title=Mime: The Missing Link in Roman Literary History  |journal=The Classical World  |volume=82  |issue=3  |pages=153\u2013163  |year=1989  |last1=Fantham  |first1=R.

They might have launched a major effort to suppress pagan learning as a danger to the Church and its doctrines.\nBut they did not. Why not? \nPerhaps it was in the slow dissemination of Christianity. After four centuries as members of a distinct religion, Christians had learned to live with Greek secular learning and to utilize it for their own benefit. Their education was heavily infiltrated by Latin and Greek pagan literature and philosophy\u2026 Although Christians found certain aspects of pagan culture and learning unacceptable, they did not view them as a cancer to be cut out of the Christian body.<ref>Grant, Edvard.

Vergil wrote the ''[[Aeneid]]'', creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together [[Greco-Roman mythology]] from the [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|creation of the universe]] to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification of Julius Caesar]]. Ovid's versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became one of the primary sources of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was so influential in the [[medieval literature|Middle Ages]] that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the \"Age of Ovid.\"<ref>''Aetas Ovidiana''; Charles McNelis, \"Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 397.</ref>\n\nThe principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] and early history became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. [[Vitruvius]]'s book ''[[De Architectura]]'', the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.\n\nLatin writers were immersed in the [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary tradition]], and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]]. The [[satires of Juvenal|poetry of Juvenal]] offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.\n\nThe period from the mid-1st century through the mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature. Under Nero, disillusioned writers reacted to Augustanism.<ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 8.</ref> The three leading writers\u2014[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, dramatist, and tutor of Nero; [[Lucan]], his nephew, who turned [[Caesar's civil war]] into [[Pharsalia|an epic poem]]; and the novelist [[Petronius]] ''([[Satyricon]])''\u2014all committed suicide after incurring the emperor's displeasure.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining good relations with the gods ''([[pax deorum]])''. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', \"the way of the ancestors\" or \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity. There was no principle analogous to \"[[separation of church and state]]\". The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same social pool of men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.\n\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', \"I give that you might give.\" Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.<ref name=r4>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. [[Apuleius]] (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.<ref>[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1</ref><ref>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 279.</ref> The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. [[Vota pro salute rei publicae|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[divus]]'') by vote of the Senate. [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the \"Kaaba of Najran\": \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-'Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; \"Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam\"), Baghdad, 1955\u20131983; P.

The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted (''[[interpretatio romana]]'') within the context of Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced, with its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France). The sanctuary established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.<ref>Fishwick, Duncan (1991).
