It aired on October 7, 2015, on the [[Cable television|cable]] network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]. The episode was co-written by creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] and [[Brad Falchuk]] and directed by Murphy.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|episode|date=January 2019}}\nTwo Swedish girls, Vendela and Agnetha, are dropped off at the Hotel Cortez. They are approached at reception by Iris, who leads them to their room. While there, one of the girls asks for ice and while walking to the machine, she notices a maid cleaning a sheet covered with blood and two children standing in the hallways. Back at the room, they both complain about a foul stench and quickly realize that it is coming from the mattress. After they cut it open, a bloody humanoid appears and attacks them. While waiting for the police to arrive, Iris assigns them Room 64 where one falls asleep. After hearing strange noises coming from the bathroom, she enters only to find ghostly children drinking her friend's blood.\n\nHomicide detective John Lowe is grieving over the disappearance of his son Holden, who was abducted on the carousel at an amusement park five years prior, and since then, his relationship with his wife Alex is failing. At a crime scene he receives an anonymous phone call pointing him to Room 64 at the Hotel Cortez. Meanwhile, at the hotel, [[heroin]] addict Gabriel is put into Room 64 and is grabbed by The Addiction Demon who violently rapes him with a conical drill-bit [[dildo]]. When he is on the verge of passing out, Sally appears and asks him to tell her that he loves her. At the front desk, John is approached by Liz Taylor, a cross dressing bartender who leads him to Room 64, where John falls asleep. Under his bed, a conscious Gabriel wakes up with a gasp. At exactly 2:25 he has a strange vision of a child, who he believes is his long lost son, Holden, who he wakes up and searches for.\n\nLater, Elizabeth, the hotel's bloodsucking, fashion obsessed owner and Donovan, Iris's son, approach a couple who they bring back to the Cortez and engage in [[group sex]]. Afterwards, The Countess and Donovan slit the couple's throats and relish in their blood. The Swedish girls are being held hostage in cages by Iris, who arrives and prepares a foul drink to purify their blood. However, she is interrupted by Sally, who sets one of the girls free for her own entertainment. While the girl runs to the front door, The Countess appears and slits her throat with her fingernail blade and tells Iris it can never happen again.\n\nJohn returns home to his family. Alex, a pediatrician is disgruntled by his late arrival which has in turn made her late for a slew of house calls. She has prepared dinner, but John and his daughter Scarlett choose instead to go out for sushi once she leaves. Over sushi, John's daughter Scarlett speaks of dreaming of her brother Holden, which makes John uncomfortable. He gets a text message from Alex which leads them back to a dark home. An officer waits for John's arrival outside and John directs him to watch Scarlett as he enters the house. The caller from earlier calls him again, restating that he would kill again. The cop leaves his post to investigate movement in the trees. Scarlett leaves the back seat of the car and wanders into the house, where she finds two men [[Disembowelment|disemboweled]] and suspended above beds. John, chasing a dark figure, gives up the chase to follow her screams. Later at John's home, Alex is frantic about her safety after her phone was cloned to lure John. She is upset about the most recent events against the backdrop of Holden's disappearance.\n\nFive years earlier, at an amusement park in [[Santa Monica]], John, Alex, and their children Scarlet and Holden are playing. While Holden is riding, John is distracted by his phone and walks off. He notices that his son's horse on the carousel is vacant and shouts around saying his name.\n\nIn the present, Will Drake, the new owner, arrives at the Cortez with his son Lachlan, and they are given a tour by real estate agent Marcy. While viewing the penthouse, they interrupt Donovan who is sleeping and are introduced to Elizabeth, who shares interest with Will. After rummaging through her records, Lachlan is given a tour around a hidden game room where he is introduced to an unaged Holden.\n\nIn 1994, Iris watches from her car as she stalks Sally and Donovan who check into the Hotel Cortez. She enters the hotel to ask Liz Taylor, the previous desk clerk, about Donovan and Sally's location and is drawn to room 64. Inside, Sally pressures Donovan to take heroin and drugs him. When Iris enters she feuds with Sally before trying to help Donovan. Sally leaves and walks through the corridor, disoriented, and stops at the end of the corridor where she gazes out of a high window. Iris appears and angrily shoves Sally out the window to her death. Back at the room, Iris spots Elizabeth admiring Donovan and asks who she is. Elizabeth responds by saying that Donovan has a \"jawline for days\". In the present, Alex and John agree to a separation. He packs his bags and moves into the Hotel Cortez, where he checks into Room 64, once again.\n\n==Reception==\n===Ratings===\n[[File:Lady Gaga ARTPOP Ball Tour.png|alt=|thumb|upright| [[Lady Gaga]]'s performance received mixed reviews from critics, but the style of The Countess was praised by critics.]]\n\"Checking In\" gained a 3.0 18\u201349 ratings share and was watched by 5.81 million viewers, leading the night on cable,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/10/08/wednesday-cable-ratings-oct-7-2015/477205/|title=Wednesday cable ratings: 'American Horror Story: Hotel' premiere on top, plus MLB, 'Teen Mom'|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> about a 5% dip from the ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'' premiere.<ref name=\"varietyratings\"/> It also topped the social ratings, driving 878,000 tweets seen by over 5.4 million people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/lostremote/scoreboard-wednesday-oct-7/54133|title=Scoreboard: Wednesday, Oct. 7|website=Lost Remote|last=Fratti|first=Karen|date=October 8, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> The episode averaged a 3.0 rating in the 18\u201349 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers, and ranked second among all primetime series aired on Wednesday night, only behind Fox's drama'' [[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.<ref name=\"varietyratings\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/ratings/ratings-lady-gaga-american-horror-story-hotel-premiere-1201613557/|title=Ratings: Viewers Go Gaga for FX's 'American Horror Story: Hotel' Premiere|accessdate=October 10, 2015|date=October 8, 2015|first=Rick|last=Kissell|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> After factoring in delayed viewing, the episode rose to 9.1 million, with 6.13 million in the 18\u201349 demographic, while combined linear, non-linear and encore viewing, it drew 12.17 million viewers through October 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/american-horror-story-hotel-ratings-fx-delayed-viewing-1201615829/|title='American Horror Story: Hotel' is FX's No. 2-Rated Telecast Ever in 3-Day Viewing|website=Variety|last=Kissel|first=Rick|date=October 12, 2015|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}</ref> \"Checking In\" is notable for being the second longest episode in the series' history, clocking in at 64 minutes, tied with the premiere of the fourth season.\n\n===Critical response===\nThe episode received mixed reviews from critics.

The Old French noun ''legende'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''legenda''.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. \"legend\"</ref> In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word ''legendary'' was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends.<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{OEtymD|legendary|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|legendry}}</ref> This word changed to ''legendry'', and ''legendary'' became the adjectival form.<ref name=\"etymonline\" />\n\nBy 1613, English-speaking [[Protestant]]s began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any [[saint]] not acknowledged in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'') was fictitious. Thus, ''legend'' gained its modern connotations of \"undocumented\" and \"[[wikt:spurious|spurious]]\", which distinguish it from the meaning of ''[[chronicle]]''.<ref>Patrick Collinson. ''Elizabethans'', \"Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs\" 2003:151\u201377, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', 1985, examines the \"Renaissance verdict\" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic [[hagiography]] in general.</ref>\n\nIn 1866, [[Jacob Grimm]] described the [[fairy tale]] as \"poetic, legend historic.\"<ref>''Das M\u00e4rchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer'', quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371)</ref> Early scholars such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Wehrhan|2=de|3=Karl Wehrhan|preserve=1}}<ref>Wehrhan ''Die Sage'' (Leipzig) 1908.</ref> [[Friedrich Ranke]]<ref>Ranke, \"Grundfragen der Volkssagen Forshung\", in Leander Petzoldt (ed.), ''Vergleichende Sagenforschung'' 1971:1\u201320, noted by Tangherlini 1990.</ref> and [[Will Erich Peuckert]]<ref>Peuckert , ''Sagen'' (Munich: E Schmidt) 1965.</ref> followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,<ref>This was stimulated in part, Tangherlini suggests, by the 1962 congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research.</ref> by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.\n[[File:Standing tall- Lapu Lapu (9234954797).jpg|thumb|[[Lapu-Lapu]], a historical figure in early 16th century [[Philippines]], has been associated with numerous legends since around the 17th century.

Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, ''legend'', in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains [[supernatural]], divine or fantastic elements.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09121a.htm ''Literary or Profane Legends'']. Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\n[[File:MataGrifone.jpg|thumb|Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the streets of [[Messina]], Italy, the second week of August, according to a legend are founders of the Sicilian city.]]\n[[File:H\u00fcbner B\u00fcrkner Genoveva.jpg|thumb|The mediaeval legend of [[Genevieve of Brabant]] connected her to [[Treves]].]]\n\n[[Hippolyte Delehaye]] distinguished legend from [[mythology|myth]]: \"The ''legend'', on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\"<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/delehaye-legends.html Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'' (1907)], Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions</ref>\n\nFrom the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'',  [[Washington Irving]] transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with [[Gothic novel|\"Gothic\" overtones]], which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nStories that exceed the boundaries of \"[[Realism (arts)|realism]]\" are called \"[[fable]]s\". For example, the [[talking animal]] formula of [[Aesop]] identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a [[donkey]] that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nLegend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea'' or \"The Golden Legend\" comprises a series of ''vitae'' or instructive  biographical narratives, tied to the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of [[hagiography]]. The ''Legenda'' was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the [[saint]] of the day.<ref>Timothy R.

The Old French noun ''legende'' derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''legenda''.<ref>''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. \"legend\"</ref> In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The word ''legendary'' was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of legends.<ref name=\"etymonline\">{{OEtymD|legendary|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|legendry}}</ref> This word changed to ''legendry'', and ''legendary'' became the adjectival form.<ref name=\"etymonline\" />\n\nBy 1613, English-speaking [[Protestant]]s began to use the word when they wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any [[saint]] not acknowledged in [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Actes and Monuments]]'') was fictitious. Thus, ''legend'' gained its modern connotations of \"undocumented\" and \"[[wikt:spurious|spurious]]\", which distinguish it from the meaning of ''[[chronicle]]''.<ref>Patrick Collinson. ''Elizabethans'', \"Truth and Legend: The Veracity of John Foxe's Book of Martyrs\" 2003:151\u201377, balances the authentic records and rhetorical presentation of Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', itself a mighty force of Protestant legend-making. Sherry L. Reames, ''The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history'', 1985, examines the \"Renaissance verdict\" on the Legenda, and its wider influence in skeptical approaches to Catholic [[hagiography]] in general.</ref>\n\nIn 1866, [[Jacob Grimm]] described the [[fairy tale]] as \"poetic, legend historic.\"<ref>''Das M\u00e4rchen ist poetischer, die Sage, historischer'', quoted at the commencement of Tangherlini's survey of legend scholarship (Tangherlini 1990:371)</ref> Early scholars such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Wehrhan|2=de|3=Karl Wehrhan|preserve=1}}<ref>Wehrhan ''Die Sage'' (Leipzig) 1908.</ref> [[Friedrich Ranke]]<ref>Ranke, \"Grundfragen der Volkssagen Forshung\", in Leander Petzoldt (ed.), ''Vergleichende Sagenforschung'' 1971:1\u201320, noted by Tangherlini 1990.</ref> and [[Will Erich Peuckert]]<ref>Peuckert , ''Sagen'' (Munich: E Schmidt) 1965.</ref> followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,<ref>This was stimulated in part, Tangherlini suggests, by the 1962 congress of the International Society for Folk Narrative Research.</ref> by addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on the line of the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson]] folktale index, provoked a search for a broader new synthesis.\n[[File:Standing tall- Lapu Lapu (9234954797).jpg|thumb|[[Lapu-Lapu]], a historical figure in early 16th century [[Philippines]], has been associated with numerous legends since around the 17th century.

Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, ''legend'', in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context but that contains [[supernatural]], divine or fantastic elements.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09121a.htm ''Literary or Profane Legends'']. Catholic Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Related concepts==\n[[File:MataGrifone.jpg|thumb|Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the streets of [[Messina]], Italy, the second week of August, according to a legend are founders of the Sicilian city.]]\n[[File:H\u00fcbner B\u00fcrkner Genoveva.jpg|thumb|The mediaeval legend of [[Genevieve of Brabant]] connected her to [[Treves]].]]\n\n[[Hippolyte Delehaye]] distinguished legend from [[mythology|myth]]: \"The ''legend'', on the other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\"<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/delehaye-legends.html Hippolyte Delehaye, ''The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography'' (1907)], Chapter I: Preliminary Definitions</ref>\n\nFrom the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary qualities begin to fade and recede: in ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'',  [[Washington Irving]] transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote with [[Gothic novel|\"Gothic\" overtones]], which actually tended to diminish its character as genuine legend.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nStories that exceed the boundaries of \"[[Realism (arts)|realism]]\" are called \"[[fable]]s\". For example, the [[talking animal]] formula of [[Aesop]] identifies his brief stories as fables, not legends. The parable of the [[Prodigal Son]] would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father. If it included a [[donkey]] that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nLegend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the original sense, through written text. [[Jacob de Voragine]]'s ''Legenda Aurea'' or \"The Golden Legend\" comprises a series of ''vitae'' or instructive  biographical narratives, tied to the [[liturgical calendar]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of [[hagiography]]. The ''Legenda'' was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and sermons appropriate to the [[saint]] of the day.<ref>Timothy R.
