The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

The Roman army, led by the future Emperor [[Titus]], with [[Tiberius Julius Alexander]] as his second-in-command, besieged and conquered the city of [[Jerusalem]], which had been controlled by Judean rebel factions since 66 CE, following the [[Jerusalem riots of 66]], when the [[Judean provisional government (66\u201368)|Judean provisional government]] was formed in Jerusalem.\n\nThe siege of the city began on 14 April 70 CE, three days before the beginning of Passover that year.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" /><ref name=\"War of the Jews\" /> The siege lasted for about four months; it ended in August 70 CE on [[Tisha B'Av]] with the burning and destruction of the [[Second Temple]].<ref>The destruction of both the [[Solomon's Temple|First]] and Second Temples is still mourned annually during the Jewish fast of [[Tisha B'Av]]. </ref> The Romans then entered and sacked the Lower City.

By May, this was breached and the Second Wall also was taken shortly afterwards, leaving the defenders in possession of the Temple and the upper and lower city. The Jewish defenders were split into factions: [[John of Giscala|John of Gischala]]'s group murdered another faction leader, [[Eleazar ben Simon]], whose men were entrenched in the forecourts of the Temple.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" /> The enmities between John of Gischala and [[Simon bar Giora]] were papered over only when the Roman siege engineers began to erect [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]]. Titus then had a wall built to girdle the city in order to starve out the population more effectively. After several failed attempts to breach or scale the walls of the [[Antonia Fortress|Fortress of Antonia]], the Romans finally launched a secret attack, overwhelming the sleeping Zealots and taking the fortress by late July.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" />\n\nAfter Jewish allies killed a number of Roman soldiers, Titus sent Josephus, the Jewish historian, to negotiate with the defenders; this ended with Jews wounding the negotiator with an arrow, and another sally was launched shortly after. Titus was almost captured during this sudden attack, but escaped.\n\nOverlooking the Temple compound, the fortress provided a perfect point from which to attack the Temple itself. [[Battering ram]]s made little progress, but the fighting itself eventually set the walls on fire; a Roman soldier threw a burning stick onto one of the Temple's walls. Destroying the Temple was not among Titus' goals, possibly due in large part to the massive expansions done by [[Herod the Great]] mere decades earlier. Titus had wanted to seize it and transform it into a temple dedicated to the [[Roman Emperor]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]]. However, the fire spread quickly and was soon out of control. The Temple was captured and destroyed on 9/10 [[Tisha B'Av]], sometime in August 70 CE, and the flames spread into the residential sections of the city.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" /><ref name=\"Levick1999\"/> Josephus described the scene:\n\n<blockquote>As the legions charged in, neither persuasion nor threat could check their impetuosity: passion alone was in command. Crowded together around the entrances many were trampled by their friends, many fell among the still hot and smoking ruins of the colonnades and died as miserably as the defeated. As they neared the Sanctuary they pretended not even to hear Caesar's commands and urged the men in front to throw in more firebrands. The partisans were no longer in a position to help; everywhere was slaughter and flight. Most of the victims were peaceful citizens, weak and unarmed, butchered wherever they were caught. Round the Altar the heaps of corpses grew higher and higher, while down the Sanctuary steps poured a river of blood and the bodies of those killed at  the top slithered to the bottom.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer1\">{{cite book |authorlink=Peter Sch\u00e4fer |first=Peter |last=Sch\u00e4fer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=unguAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT191 |title=The History of the Jews in Antiquity |publisher=Routledge |orig-year=1995 |year=2013 |page=191\u2013192 |isbn=9781134371372 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Catapulta by Edward Poynter.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Catapulta]]'', by [[Edward Poynter]] (1868).

According to Josephus, it was the Jews who first used fire in the Northwest approach to the Temple to try and stop Roman advances. Only then did Roman soldiers set fire to an apartment adjacent to the Temple, starting a conflagration which the Jews subsequently made worse.<ref>{{cite book |author=Mireille Hadas-Lebel | title=Jerusalem Against Rome | publisher=Peeters Publishers | date=2006 | page=86}}</ref>\n\nJosephus had acted as a mediator for the Romans and, when negotiations failed, witnessed the siege and aftermath. He wrote:\n<blockquote>Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder, because there remained none to be the objects of their fury (for they would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be done), [Titus] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city and Temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as they were of the greatest eminence; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne; and so much of the wall enclosed the city on the west side. This wall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in garrison [in the Upper City], as were the towers [the three forts] also spared, in order to demonstrate to posterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the Roman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall [surrounding Jerusalem], it was so thoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the foundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it [Jerusalem] had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.<ref>{{Cite Josephus|PACEJ=1|text=bj|bookno=7|chap=1|sec=1|show-translator=yes|abbr=yes}}</ref><br>\nAnd truly, the very view itself was a melancholy thing; for those places which were adorned with trees and pleasant gardens, were now become desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut down. Nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judaea and the most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn sadly at so great a change. For the war had laid all signs of beauty quite waste. Nor had anyone who had known the place before, had come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again.

By May, this was breached and the Second Wall also was taken shortly afterwards, leaving the defenders in possession of the Temple and the upper and lower city. The Jewish defenders were split into factions: [[John of Giscala|John of Gischala]]'s group murdered another faction leader, [[Eleazar ben Simon]], whose men were entrenched in the forecourts of the Temple.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" /> The enmities between John of Gischala and [[Simon bar Giora]] were papered over only when the Roman siege engineers began to erect [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]]. Titus then had a wall built to girdle the city in order to starve out the population more effectively. After several failed attempts to breach or scale the walls of the [[Antonia Fortress|Fortress of Antonia]], the Romans finally launched a secret attack, overwhelming the sleeping Zealots and taking the fortress by late July.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" />\n\nAfter Jewish allies killed a number of Roman soldiers, Titus sent Josephus, the Jewish historian, to negotiate with the defenders; this ended with Jews wounding the negotiator with an arrow, and another sally was launched shortly after. Titus was almost captured during this sudden attack, but escaped.\n\nOverlooking the Temple compound, the fortress provided a perfect point from which to attack the Temple itself. [[Battering ram]]s made little progress, but the fighting itself eventually set the walls on fire; a Roman soldier threw a burning stick onto one of the Temple's walls. Destroying the Temple was not among Titus' goals, possibly due in large part to the massive expansions done by [[Herod the Great]] mere decades earlier. Titus had wanted to seize it and transform it into a temple dedicated to the [[Roman Emperor]] and the [[Roman mythology|Roman pantheon]]. However, the fire spread quickly and was soon out of control. The Temple was captured and destroyed on 9/10 [[Tisha B'Av]], sometime in August 70 CE, and the flames spread into the residential sections of the city.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer\" /><ref name=\"Levick1999\"/> Josephus described the scene:\n\n<blockquote>As the legions charged in, neither persuasion nor threat could check their impetuosity: passion alone was in command. Crowded together around the entrances many were trampled by their friends, many fell among the still hot and smoking ruins of the colonnades and died as miserably as the defeated. As they neared the Sanctuary they pretended not even to hear Caesar's commands and urged the men in front to throw in more firebrands. The partisans were no longer in a position to help; everywhere was slaughter and flight. Most of the victims were peaceful citizens, weak and unarmed, butchered wherever they were caught. Round the Altar the heaps of corpses grew higher and higher, while down the Sanctuary steps poured a river of blood and the bodies of those killed at  the top slithered to the bottom.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer1\">{{cite book |authorlink=Peter Sch\u00e4fer |first=Peter |last=Sch\u00e4fer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=unguAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT191 |title=The History of the Jews in Antiquity |publisher=Routledge |orig-year=1995 |year=2013 |page=191\u2013192 |isbn=9781134371372 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Catapulta by Edward Poynter.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Catapulta]]'', by [[Edward Poynter]] (1868).

He wrote:\n<blockquote>Now as soon as the army had no more people to slay or to plunder, because there remained none to be the objects of their fury (for they would not have spared any, had there remained any other work to be done), [Titus] Caesar gave orders that they should now demolish the entire city and Temple, but should leave as many of the towers standing as they were of the greatest eminence; that is, Phasaelus, and Hippicus, and Mariamne; and so much of the wall enclosed the city on the west side. This wall was spared, in order to afford a camp for such as were to lie in garrison [in the Upper City], as were the towers [the three forts] also spared, in order to demonstrate to posterity what kind of city it was, and how well fortified, which the Roman valor had subdued; but for all the rest of the wall [surrounding Jerusalem], it was so thoroughly laid even with the ground by those that dug it up to the foundation, that there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it [Jerusalem] had ever been inhabited. This was the end which Jerusalem came to by the madness of those that were for innovations; a city otherwise of great magnificence, and of mighty fame among all mankind.<ref>{{Cite Josephus|PACEJ=1|text=bj|bookno=7|chap=1|sec=1|show-translator=yes|abbr=yes}}</ref><br>\nAnd truly, the very view itself was a melancholy thing; for those places which were adorned with trees and pleasant gardens, were now become desolate country every way, and its trees were all cut down. Nor could any foreigner that had formerly seen Judaea and the most beautiful suburbs of the city, and now saw it as a desert, but lament and mourn sadly at so great a change. For the war had laid all signs of beauty quite waste. Nor had anyone who had known the place before, had come on a sudden to it now, would he have known it again.

With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one. He tries to ignore character [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in an attempt to write \"honestly\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself \"What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to say or do to convey that and no more?\"<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/>\n\nBefore writing a game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire outline of the story, before exploring the narrative more intricately, discussing the \"moment-to-moment beats\" of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with the middle of the story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> ''The Frame'' host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including ''A Second Chance at Sarah'' and ''The Last of Us'', is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he had not noticed this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.<ref name=\"DoG Time\"/><ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nDruckmann cites game writer [[Sam Lake]] as a large inspiration, naming himself a \"longtime fan\".<ref name=\"Sam Lake\"/> Druckmann's favorite video games include ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''Ico'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"Reddit games\"/> and he is often inspired by character-focused comics such as ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' (1995\u20132000), and ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'' (2002\u20132008).<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann was also influenced by the character-driven storytelling in the [[adventure game]] ''[[King's Quest]]'' by [[Roberta Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken and Roberta Williams (Sierra) - The Game Awards 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQkRp-VFXQ |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Gamerview |accessdate=12 May 2019 |date=6 December 2014}}</ref> While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann was inspired by several films, including: ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), for its ability to make audiences support the protagonist despite his immorality; ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), due to its subtle and sparse execution, forcing audience engagement;<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), in regards to simplicity and intensity.<ref name=\"Best Film\"/>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"While working on ''The Last of Us'' ...

Druckmann is proud that Ellie is a \"strong, non-sexualized female lead character\", and hoped that other developers would take similar approaches to characters without fear of unpopularity.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> Druckmann and Straley were surprised by some of the backlash in regards to gender roles in ''The Last of Us'', although Druckmann noted that \"the more progress we make, the more those problems stand out\".<ref name=\"Backlash\"/> He declared it a \"misconception\" that female protagonists hinder game sales,<ref name=\"TLOU Cover\"/> evidenced by the success of ''The Last of Us''.<ref name=\"Backlash\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nDruckmann currently resides in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] with his wife Maya<ref name=\"WGA\"/> and children.<ref name=\"failure\"/><ref name=\"Disaster\"/><ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> He became a father during the development of ''The Last of Us'';<ref name=\"failure\"/> his daughter was a \"huge inspiration\" to him when writing the game.<ref name=\"Reddit daughter\"/> He found that the birth of his daughter reinforced his ideas about family, realizing he would \"do anything\" for her.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann plays video games with his children, citing ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' (2020) and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series.<ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> On his first day as director on ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann suffered from [[headache]]s and began [[Diplopia|seeing double]]; he discovered the following day that he required emergency eye surgery, as an infection threatened his vision in his left eye.<ref name=\"Retro Replay\"/> Druckmann is [[Judaism|Jewish]], although found he regularly writes about \"[[White people|white]], [[Heterosexual|straight]], [[Christianity|Christian]] male\" characters, encouraging him to instead create more diverse characters.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0;\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year !! scope=\"col\"| Game title !! scope=\"col\"| Role\n|-\n| 2004 || ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/>\n|-\n| 2004 || ''[[Jak 3]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2007 || ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' || Game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' || Co-lead game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"Edge\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' || Original design and story<ref name=\"Frontier\">{{cite video game |title=''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' |developer=[[High Impact Games]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=November 3, 2009 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] |version=1.0 |scene=Credits }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2013 || ''[[The Last of Us]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2014 || ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"TLOULB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |title=The Last of Us Developers Talk Left Behind DLC [SPOILERS] |last=Jayne |first=Jeremy |publisher=[[GameSpot]].

He later co-wrote ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'' with artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]], and is currently working on a sequel to ''The Last of Us'', subtitled ''[[The Last of Us Part II|Part II]]'', and a television adaptation.\n\nDruckmann has received high praise for his work on ''The Last of Us'', receiving several awards and nominations for his contributions, including two [[British Academy Games Awards|BAFTA Awards]], two [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Awards]], and three [[Writers Guild of America Awards]].

Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one. He tries to ignore character [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in an attempt to write \"honestly\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself \"What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to say or do to convey that and no more?\"<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/>\n\nBefore writing a game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire outline of the story, before exploring the narrative more intricately, discussing the \"moment-to-moment beats\" of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with the middle of the story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> ''The Frame'' host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including ''A Second Chance at Sarah'' and ''The Last of Us'', is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he had not noticed this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.<ref name=\"DoG Time\"/><ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nDruckmann cites game writer [[Sam Lake]] as a large inspiration, naming himself a \"longtime fan\".<ref name=\"Sam Lake\"/> Druckmann's favorite video games include ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''Ico'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"Reddit games\"/> and he is often inspired by character-focused comics such as ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' (1995\u20132000), and ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'' (2002\u20132008).<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann was also influenced by the character-driven storytelling in the [[adventure game]] ''[[King's Quest]]'' by [[Roberta Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken and Roberta Williams (Sierra) - The Game Awards 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQkRp-VFXQ |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Gamerview |accessdate=12 May 2019 |date=6 December 2014}}</ref> While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann was inspired by several films, including: ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), for its ability to make audiences support the protagonist despite his immorality; ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), due to its subtle and sparse execution, forcing audience engagement;<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), in regards to simplicity and intensity.<ref name=\"Best Film\"/>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"While working on ''The Last of Us'' ...

Druckmann is proud that Ellie is a \"strong, non-sexualized female lead character\", and hoped that other developers would take similar approaches to characters without fear of unpopularity.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> Druckmann and Straley were surprised by some of the backlash in regards to gender roles in ''The Last of Us'', although Druckmann noted that \"the more progress we make, the more those problems stand out\".<ref name=\"Backlash\"/> He declared it a \"misconception\" that female protagonists hinder game sales,<ref name=\"TLOU Cover\"/> evidenced by the success of ''The Last of Us''.<ref name=\"Backlash\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nDruckmann currently resides in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] with his wife Maya<ref name=\"WGA\"/> and children.<ref name=\"failure\"/><ref name=\"Disaster\"/><ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> He became a father during the development of ''The Last of Us'';<ref name=\"failure\"/> his daughter was a \"huge inspiration\" to him when writing the game.<ref name=\"Reddit daughter\"/> He found that the birth of his daughter reinforced his ideas about family, realizing he would \"do anything\" for her.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann plays video games with his children, citing ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' (2020) and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series.<ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> On his first day as director on ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann suffered from [[headache]]s and began [[Diplopia|seeing double]]; he discovered the following day that he required emergency eye surgery, as an infection threatened his vision in his left eye.<ref name=\"Retro Replay\"/> Druckmann is [[Judaism|Jewish]], although found he regularly writes about \"[[White people|white]], [[Heterosexual|straight]], [[Christianity|Christian]] male\" characters, encouraging him to instead create more diverse characters.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0;\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year !! scope=\"col\"| Game title !! scope=\"col\"| Role\n|-\n| 2004 || ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/>\n|-\n| 2004 || ''[[Jak 3]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2007 || ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' || Game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' || Co-lead game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"Edge\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' || Original design and story<ref name=\"Frontier\">{{cite video game |title=''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' |developer=[[High Impact Games]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=November 3, 2009 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] |version=1.0 |scene=Credits }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2013 || ''[[The Last of Us]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2014 || ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"TLOULB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |title=The Last of Us Developers Talk Left Behind DLC [SPOILERS] |last=Jayne |first=Jeremy |publisher=[[GameSpot]].

She tells him how one night she had once seen an owl perched on one of the branches of the tree and it had cheered her up that day because she had been sad about something. Thus to her it is the owl tree. She also told that half of it is mine because some branches of that tree fall in her garden.\n\nOne day, Granny Diamond informs Joe that Mr Rock is planning to cut down the tree. Granny Diamond was very sad due to this, Joe begins trying to find a way to save the tree with the help of Minna and the Ludd twins and thinks that it is time for him to meet the owl in the owl tree because he is worried about how Granny Diamond will be affected if it is cut down. One day, Joe realises the tree is trying to tell him something so he goes to Mr Rock's house but becomes frightened and returns. Getting curious one night, he climbs the tree by one of its branches which is close to his bedroom window but then slips and falls into Mr Rock's garden. Mr Rock takes Joe back, causing a long argument between him, Joe and Granny over the tree but cannot be persuaded to keep it.\n\nLater, Joe goes by himself to Mr Rock's house and talks to him personally. While talking, Mr Rock notices that Joe resembles his grandson, Tom. Suddenly, it occurs to Mr Rock that Tom also used to talk about some owl in the tree. Mr Rock gets emotional but still doesn't change his mind about the tree. Joe, knowing his stubbornness, goes back home. On the bonfire night, Joe sees Granny and Mr Rock standing near the hedge talking. Granny happily comes and informs Joe that the tree will not be cut.

She also told that half of it is mine because some branches of that tree fall in her garden.\n\nOne day, Granny Diamond informs Joe that Mr Rock is planning to cut down the tree. Granny Diamond was very sad due to this, Joe begins trying to find a way to save the tree with the help of Minna and the Ludd twins and thinks that it is time for him to meet the owl in the owl tree because he is worried about how Granny Diamond will be affected if it is cut down. One day, Joe realises the tree is trying to tell him something so he goes to Mr Rock's house but becomes frightened and returns. Getting curious one night, he climbs the tree by one of its branches which is close to his bedroom window but then slips and falls into Mr Rock's garden. Mr Rock takes Joe back, causing a long argument between him, Joe and Granny over the tree but cannot be persuaded to keep it.\n\nLater, Joe goes by himself to Mr Rock's house and talks to him personally. While talking, Mr Rock notices that Joe resembles his grandson, Tom. Suddenly, it occurs to Mr Rock that Tom also used to talk about some owl in the tree. Mr Rock gets emotional but still doesn't change his mind about the tree. Joe, knowing his stubbornness, goes back home. On the bonfire night, Joe sees Granny and Mr Rock standing near the hedge talking. Granny happily comes and informs Joe that the tree will not be cut. The story ends with fireworks.\n\n==Characters==\nJoe, Minna, Granny Diamond, Mr Rock, The Ludd twins,\n\n==Reception==\nThe Book Trust  describes ''The Owl Tree'' as 'An uplifting, award-winning story which reminds us not to judge people on first impressions.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.booktrust.org.uk/books/view/29156|website=www.booktrust.org.uk |title=The Owl Tree |publisher=Book Trust |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>  School zone finds it 'an extremely well written story which is an excellent read aloud.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingzone.com/index.php?zone=sz&page=booklists2&area=602|website=www.readingzone.com |title=Booklist|publisher=ReadingZone |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>  [[Trinity College London]] calls it 'An atmospheric, descriptive piece about discovering the secrets that might be held in the branches of a tree.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitycollege.com/gallery/anthologyonline/download.php?id=1006 |website=www.trinitycollege.com |title=The Owl-Tree |publisher=Trinity College |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt was amongst the titles used in the 2011 Reading Crusade at [[Christchurch]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/BiblioFile/2011/ReadingCrusade/Teachers/Resource-Pack.pdf |website=www.christchurchcitylibraries.com |title=Reading Crusade 11 April - 23 May 2011|publisher=OtautahiChristchurch City Libraries  |accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> amongst books recommended for lower primary children by [[Paul Jennings (Australian author)|Paul Jennings]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pauljennings.com.au/files/product_docs/1722_doc1.doc|website=www.pauljennings.com.au |title=The Reading Bug |publisher=Paul Jennings |accessdate=29 March 2015 }}</ref> and has appeared on numerous school reading lists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://learning.bps.bucks.sch.uk/file.php/1/parent_homework_booklet.pdf|website=www.learning.bps.bucks.sch.uk |title=Years 3 and 4 Homework Help for Parents|publisher=Buckingham Primary School |accessdate=29 March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/prep/files/News/weekly_mailing/july/07072012/3456_suggestedreading_summer.pdf|website=www.abingdon.org.uk |title=Abingdon Prep School Middle School Suggested Reading; for boys entering Years 3, 4, 5 and 6 in September 2012 |publisher=[[Abingdon Preparatory School]] |accessdate=29 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar |Children's literature}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Jenny Nimmo}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Owl Tree}}\n[[Category:British children's novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Jenny Nimmo]]\n[[Category:1997 British novels]]\n[[Category:1997 children's books]]\n[[Category:Plants in children literature]]\n", "name_user": "58.65.198.15", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCharacters)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Owl_Tree"}

Gisaka.{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=158}} The formation in the 17th century of a new Rwandan dynasty by mwami [[Ruganzu Ndoli|Ruganzu Ndori]], followed by eastward

1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda in 1908.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}}{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} The first businesses were established in Kigali that year by Greek and Indian

sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=127}} In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside [[Gisenyi]].{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=135}} The difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, and a crippling famine, led the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=130}} Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=142}}{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=275}} This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Des

officials and expansion of control.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}} Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in [[Ruanda-Urundi]]'s capital [[Usumbura]], now known as Bujumbura in Burundi.{{sfn|Infor Congo|1958}} Usumbura's population exceeded 50,000 during the 1950s, and was the colony's only European-style

Butare was initially the leading contender to be the capital of the new independent nation, but Kigali was chosen because of its more central location. The city grew slowly during the following decades, but retained a small-town feel, with just 25,000 people and five paved roads by the early 1970s.{{sfn|Mohr|1973}} On 6 July 1973 there was [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a bloodless military coup]], in which minister of defence [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] overthrew ruling president [[Gregoire Kayibanda]].{{sfn|Mohr|1973}} Businesses closed for a few days, and troops patrolled across the city,{{sfn|Associated Press|1973}} but life had returned to normal and the army had left the streets by 11 July.{{sfn|U.S. Department of State|1973}}\n\nIn April 1994 President Habyarimana [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was assassinated]], when his plane was shot down near Kigali Airport.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2010}} This was the catalyst for the [[Rwandan genocide]], in which 500,000\u20131,000,000<ref name=\"Death Toll\">See, e.g., [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13431486 Rwanda: How the genocide happened], [[BBC]], 17 May 2011, which gives an estimate of 800,000, and [http://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/subjindx/121rwan.htm OAU sets inquiry into Rwanda genocide], Africa Recovery, Vol. 12 1#1 (August 1998), p. 4, which estimates the number at between 500,000 and 1,000,000.

On 8 April, Rwandan government forces attacked the RPF base in the parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops successfully fought back.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|pp=264\u2013265}} The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with its isolated troops in Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=269}} The RPF advanced steadily, capturing large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=288}} but avoiding an attack on the city itself, because the city was too heavily defended.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=158}} They instead conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle Kigali and cut off supply routes,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} as well as capturing the rest of the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} By mid-June, the RPF encirclement was complete, and they began fighting for the city itself.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The government forces had superior manpower and weapons but the RPF fought tactically,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} and were able to exploit the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=421}} The RPF took control of Kigali on 4 July,{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=459}} a date now commemorated as the [[Liberation Day]] [[Public holidays in Rwanda|national holiday]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Official holidays |url=http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |accessdate=12 November 2013 |publisher=[[Government of Rwanda|gov.rw]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911035627/http://www.gov.rw/Official-holidays |archivedate=11 September 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough damaged, the city's structure has recovered.\n\n==Geography==\n<!--[[File:Kigali SPOT 1095.jpg|thumb|right|Kigali seen from Spot Satellite]]-->\n[[File:KigaliSuburbs.png|thumb|300px|Map showing major suburbs of Kigali]]\nKigali is located in the centre of Rwanda, at {{Coord|1|57|S|30|4|E|type:city_region:BD|display=inline}}.{{sfn|CIA|2007|p=479}} The city is coterminous with the province of Kigali, one of the five [[provinces of Rwanda]] introduced in 2006 as part of a restructuring of local government in the country.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city has boundaries with the [[Northern Province, Rwanda|Northern]], [[Eastern Province, Rwanda|Eastern]] and [[Southern Province, Rwanda|Southern]] provinces.{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2006}} The city is divided into three administrative [[Districts of Rwanda|districts]]\u2014[[Nyarugenge District|Nyarugenge]], which lies in the south west, [[Kicukiro District|Kicukiro]] in the south east, and [[Gasabo District|Gasabo]], which occupies the northern half of the city's territory.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=11}} Kigali lies in a region of rolling hills,{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}} with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes.{{sfn|REMA|2013|pp=7\u20138}} Kigali lies between the two mountains of [[Mount Kigali]] and [[Mount Jali]],{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} both of which have altitudes over {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}},{{sfn|ITMB Publishing|2007}} while the lowest areas of the city have an altitude of {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=7}} Geologically, the city lies in a [[granitic]] and [[metasedimentary]] region, with [[lateritic]] soils on the hills and [[alluvial]] soils in the valleys.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=5}}\n\nThe [[Nyabarongo River]], part of the upper headwaters of the [[Nile River|Nile]],{{sfn|BBC News (II)|2006}} forms the western and southern borders of the administrative city of Kigali,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=4}} although this river lies somewhat outside the built-up urban area.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=6}} The largest river running through the city is the [[Nyabugogo River]], which flows south from [[Lake Muhazi]] before flowing west between Mount Kigali and Mount Jali, and draining into the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} The Nyabugogo is fed by various smaller streams throughout the city, and its [[drainage basin]] contains most of Kigali's territory,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=8}} other than areas in the south which outflow directly to the Nyabarongo.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}} The rivers are flanked by [[wetland]]s, which act as a water store and flood protection for the city, although these are under threat from agriculture and development.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=9}}\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n[[File: Suburban Sprawl in Kigali.jpg|thumb|left| Boulevard in Kigali]]\n\nThe [[central business district]] (CBD) (known in Kinyarwanda as ''mu mujyi'') of Kigali lies on [[Nyarugenge Hill]], and was the site of the original city founded by Richard Kandt in 1907.{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} The house that Kandt lived in is now the [[Kandt House Museum of Natural History]].{{sfn|Mbanda|2014}} Geographically, the CBD lies towards the western edge of the built-up area,{{sfn|Tumwebaze (I)|2011}} as the terrain to the east was more suitable for development of the expanding city than the high slopes of Mount Kigali to the west.

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]].

There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration.

The city hosts the main residence and offices of the [[President of Rwanda]] and government ministries. The city is within the [[Provinces of Rwanda|province]] of Kigali City, which was enlarged in January 2006, as part of local government reorganisation in the country. Kigali's city limits cover the whole province; it is consolidated. The city's urban area covers about 70% of the municipal boundaries.<ref>[http://www.kigalicity.gov.rw/spip.php?article2 \"Kigali at a Glance\"]

Most leave from the Nyabugogo bus station. These services include:\n* Modern Coast, a [[Kenya]]n coach and courier service which connects [[Gisenyi]]/[[Goma]] through [[Kyanika]] and Kigali through [[Gatuna]] to [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]]. It offers online booking and payment, three seat classes and in some busses personal TVs and 240 V/USB sockets.\n* Jaguar Executive Coaches, which connects Kigali to [[Kampala]], the [[Uganda]]n capital, via [[Gatuna]] or via [[Kayonza]] and [[Kagitumba]].\n* Yahoo Car Express \u2013 A minibus service running between Kigali and [[Bujumbura]] in [[Burundi]].\n* Kampala Coach Ltd, which runs services to Kampala (8 hours), Nairobi in Kenya (24 hours), Dar es Salaam in Tanzania (36 hours) and Mombasa in Kenya (32 hours).\n\nKigali is the hub of the Rwanda transport network, with 15 minutes express bus routes to all major towns in the country. There are also taxi minibus services ([[matatu]]s) leaving from Kigali, which also go through to the major towns, but some of them stop frequently along the route to pick people up or drop them off.\n\nPublic transport within Kigali is shifting from using small matatus to bigger city buses, which are connecting the most important sectors. These buses use a cash-free payment system called [[Tap&Go]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.igihe.com/news/ac-group-launches-tap-go-smart-payment-solution.html|title=AC Group launches Tap&Go smart payment solution for public transport|website=en.igihe.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}</ref> In 2017, matatus were still used to connect the more remote areas of the city. In contrast to the national express buses, these services wait to fill up before setting off from the terminus, then pick up and drop off frequently en route.\n\nKigali has many taxis (known as 'special hire' or 'taxi voiture'), which are generally painted white with an orange stripe down the side. Even more popular are motorbike taxis ('taxi moto'), which offer a service similar to a taxi, but for lower prices, typically in the range 300-1000 [[Rwanda franc|FRW]].\n\n==Future==\nUnder a master plan for 2040, Kigali will be decentralised, with business, shopping, and leisure districts, and suburbs. The plan calls for skyscrapers, arching pedestrian walkways and [[Urban open space|green spaces]] to be built, alongside amenities such as fountains and a wetlands conservation area. In addition, there will be an effective public transportation network. However, among the most pressing problems is affordable housing for the majority of the city's population, and a number of schemes are under consideration. The city's population of about 1.2 million is expected to triple by that time.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices | title=Kigali's future or costly fantasy?
