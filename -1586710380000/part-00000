{"title_page": "Troika (ride)", "text_new": "[[File:Troika Cedar Point.jpg|thumb|250px|Troika at [[Cedar Point]] in [[Sandusky, OH]]]]\nThe '''Troika''' is an [[amusement park]] ride designed and manufactured by [[HUSS Park Attractions]] in the mid-1970s. The name [[Wikt:troika|Troika]] means \"group of three\" in Russian, a reference to its three armed design. There are several variations on the design.\n\n== Design ==\n[[HUSS Park Attractions]] designed and manufactured the first Troika [[Amusement park ride|ride]] in the mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is named after the Russian word meaning [[Wikt:troika|\"group of three\"]], a reference to its three armed design.\n\n==Description and operation==\n[[File:Cedar Point Troika ride (1746).ogv|thumb|Video of the Troika ride at [[Cedar Point]].]]\nA Troika consists of three arms radiating from a central column. At the end of each arm is a wheel-like assembly (star) holding seven gondolas, each of which seats 2 people side by side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhen the ride is activated, the central column rotates clockwise, while the Star at the end of each arm rotates counterclockwise. Hydraulic cylinders then raise the arms to an angle of 40\u00b0. The gondolas do have some capacity to rock from side to side, but this is minimal. At the end of the ride cycle, the arms are lowered, and the rotation stopped. Because it is a relatively mild thrill ride, it is a good ride for younger children or beginning riders who aren't up to riding more extreme attractions, like Huss's own [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] or [[Top Spin (ride)|Top Spin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe main safety restraint is a [[Buzz bars|buzz bar]] system, which locks into one of five positions. Huss recommends that riders be at least 42 inches tall with an adult or over 50 inches tall to ride alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Variants and modern adaptions==\nThe ride is available in both transportable and permanent forms, although due to the total weight and size of the ride (35 tons, plus an additional 27 tons for the temporary base and platform), transportable Troikas are unpopular and uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPortable versions of the Troika can be disassembled, but due to the size and weight of the machinery and platform, rack onto no fewer than three trailers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===AirBoat===\nHuss now makes a modern version of the Troika, called the AirBoat. It is smaller and can only carry 24 people (with 3 pods and 4 cars per pod). It runs at about the same speed. One example that is no longer running was the Gator Bait ride at [[Six Flags New Orleans]]; this ride closed due to damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Scorpion===\nThe Tivoli Scorpion is based on the same pattern as the Troika, but a much smaller gondola wheel diameter results in greater speed and centripetal force experienced by the riders (claimed to be over {{convert|100|km/h}}). The Scorpion is significantly lighter than a Troika, making it more popular for operation at carnivals and fairs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Troika Installations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name !!

The name [[Wikt:troika|Troika]] means \"group of three\" in Russian, a reference to its three armed design. There are several variations on the design.\n\n== Design ==\n[[HUSS Park Attractions]] designed and manufactured the first Troika [[Amusement park ride|ride]] in the mid-1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is named after the Russian word meaning [[Wikt:troika|\"group of three\"]], a reference to its three armed design.\n\n==Description and operation==\n[[File:Cedar Point Troika ride (1746).ogv|thumb|Video of the Troika ride at [[Cedar Point]].]]\nA Troika consists of three arms radiating from a central column. At the end of each arm is a wheel-like assembly (star) holding seven gondolas, each of which seats 2 people side by side. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhen the ride is activated, the central column rotates clockwise, while the Star at the end of each arm rotates counterclockwise. Hydraulic cylinders then raise the arms to an angle of 40\u00b0. The gondolas do have some capacity to rock from side to side, but this is minimal. At the end of the ride cycle, the arms are lowered, and the rotation stopped. Because it is a relatively mild thrill ride, it is a good ride for younger children or beginning riders who aren't up to riding more extreme attractions, like Huss's own [[Enterprise (ride)|Enterprise]] or [[Top Spin (ride)|Top Spin]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThe main safety restraint is a [[Buzz bars|buzz bar]] system, which locks into one of five positions. Huss recommends that riders be at least 42 inches tall with an adult or over 50 inches tall to ride alone.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n==Variants and modern adaptions==\nThe ride is available in both transportable and permanent forms, although due to the total weight and size of the ride (35 tons, plus an additional 27 tons for the temporary base and platform), transportable Troikas are unpopular and uncommon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nPortable versions of the Troika can be disassembled, but due to the size and weight of the machinery and platform, rack onto no fewer than three trailers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===AirBoat===\nHuss now makes a modern version of the Troika, called the AirBoat. It is smaller and can only carry 24 people (with 3 pods and 4 cars per pod). It runs at about the same speed. One example that is no longer running was the Gator Bait ride at [[Six Flags New Orleans]]; this ride closed due to damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Scorpion===\nThe Tivoli Scorpion is based on the same pattern as the Troika, but a much smaller gondola wheel diameter results in greater speed and centripetal force experienced by the riders (claimed to be over {{convert|100|km/h}}). The Scorpion is significantly lighter than a Troika, making it more popular for operation at carnivals and fairs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Troika Installations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Name !!

In October 1885, he was elected deputy for [[Eure-et-Loir]]. From the first, he took an important place in the chamber, as one of the most notable orators of the Progressist Republican group. In January 1896, he was elected vice-president of the chamber, and henceforth devoted himself to the struggle against the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], not only in parliament, but also in public meetings throughout France.\n\nHis addresses at [[Marseille]] on 26 October 1896, at [[Carmaux]] on 27 December 1896, and at [[Roubaix]] on 10 April 1897, were triumphs of clear and eloquent exposition of the political and social aims of the Progressist party.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n=== Presidency ===\nIn June 1898, he was elected president of the chamber, and was re-elected in 1901, but rejected in 1902. Nevertheless, he came forward brilliantly in 1904 and 1905 as a supporter of the law on the [[separation of church and state]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He also gained a position on the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and was president of the committee when the [[Agadir Crisis#Negotiations|Franco-German treaty of 1911]] came before Parliament.<ref name=\"EB1922\">{{EB1922|title=Deschanel, Paul Eug\u00e8ne Louis |volume=30 |pages=835\u2013836 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri30chisrich#page/835/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nHe was re-elected deputy in 1910, and on 23 May 1912 was chosen to be the President of the Chamber.

The 570GT is the less track focused, and more road trip worthy version of the 570S. The 570GT sports a side opening cargo hatch above the mid-mounted engine for additional cargo space in place of the engine cover of the 570S, slightly softer suspension settings and improved sound insulation.\n\n===570S GT4 and Sprint===\n[[File:McLaren 570S Orange.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|McLaren 570S Sprint]]\n[[File:Equipe Verschuur McLaren 570S.jpg|thumb|right|McLaren 570S GT4]]\nAnnounced online in early 2016, and making their public debut at the [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]], the 570S GT4 and 570S Sprint are the track oriented iterations of the 570S. McLaren disclosed shortly after the announcement, that the track cars were built alongside their base model. Changes include a new air jack suspension system, racing style aero package, and center-lock magnesium alloys wrapped in [[Pirelli]] racing slicks. McLaren also added a new race style cooling system and radiator, but the powertrain remained unchanged. The GT4 made its racing debut at the British GT Championship in April 2016. The 570S Sprint has been made commercially available for customers. The Sprint was built alongside the GT4 counterpart, but without the FIA restrictions required on the GT4. The car can be updated to the GT4 specifications at the owner's request.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cars.mclaren.com/featured-articles/introducing-the-570s-sprint.html|title=McLaren 570S GT4 and Sprint|publisher=McLaren Automotive|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===570S Spider===\n[[File:McLaren 570S Spider (37259107741).jpg|thumb|McLaren 570S Spider]]\nThe convertible version of the 570S was unveiled at the 2017 [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] event. It borrows the roof folding mechanism from the Super Series line-up. The two-piece aluminium roof folds into a compartment located behind the seats of the car leaving the rear buttress in place. The roof folding mechanism takes 30 seconds to fold and unfold and is operable at speeds up to {{cvt|30|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Unlike the 12C Spider and the 650S Spider, the 570S spider required no significant reengineering for the folding roof mechanism because of the carbon monocell used in the 570S. As a result, the 570S Spider is only {{cvt|46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than the coupe. The drivetrain of the Spider remains identical to that of the coupe which results in similar performance to the coup\u00e9 counterpart with the roof up. The Spider has new forged aluminium wheels and three special launch colours namely Vega Blue, Sicilian Yellow and Ventura Orange. Deliveries of the Spider began in late 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/mclaren/570s/19522/new-mclaren-570s-spider-revealed|title=McLaren 570S Spider revealed|first= Jordan|last= Katsianis|publisher= Evo magazine|date= 29 June 2017|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mclaren/570s-spider|title= McLaren 570S Spider, price and specifications|first= Jesse|last= Crosse|publisher= Auto car|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===MSO X===\n\nTo celebrate the Daytona 24 event, McLaren Newport Beach, the US dealer of McLaren commissioned ten bespoke 570S from McLaren Special Operations based on the 570S GT4 race car. The cars dubbed the '''MSO X''' are created to create the feel of the GT4 racer without taking away everyday road usability. The exterior of the car takes heavy influence from the GT4 race car and includes a carbon fibre roof with a functional 'goose neck' air intake mounted on the top which exits from a modified rear fascia, GT4 style rear wing which creates {{cvt|100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of additional downforce, functional air intakes on the bonnet, tow hooks on the front and rear and a titanium exhaust system. The interior of the car is also designed to simulate the GT4 racer without taking away the creature comforts and includes exposed carbon fibre monocell throughout, carbon fibre racing bucket seats with customizable six point racing harness, Alcantara interior trim and a carbon fibre bulkhead located at the rear to store the helmets of the occupants while keeping the air conditioning system, parking assist, front lift system and GPS navigation system as standard equipment. The storage locker in the dashboard and the storage compartments at the front and rear have been removed in order to accommodate the air intakes and to keep the car feel as close to the race car as possible. All the ten cars feature distinctive liveries inspired by the iconic liveries featuring on the [[McLaren F1 GTR]] which competed in LeMans during the 1990s.

Inspired by the [[McLaren 650S|675LT]] and the [[McLaren F1 GTR|F1 GTR Longtail]], the body of the car has been extended by {{cvt|2.9|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The car also features enhanced aerodynamic elements such as an extended front splitter and rear diffuser, new side sills, and an aero-enhancing fixed rear wing for increased downforce. McLaren claims that 23% parts on the 600LT are new as compared to the 570S. The carbon fibre monocoque utilised in the 600LT is modified and this combined with the extensive use of carbon fibre in the roof along with the cantrails and front fenders, results in a weight saving of {{cvt|212|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} over the 570S, with the total weight amounting to {{cvt|2749|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Another distinguishing feature of the 600LT is the lightweight titanium exhaust system which is mounted on top of the rear of the car which harks back to its original application in the [[McLaren Senna|Senna]]. The interior features sports bucket seats from the P1 and [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]] trim but can be optioned with the much lighter bucket seats found in the Senna. The 3.8-litre [[twin-turbo]]charged V8 engine utilised in the 600LT is tuned to produce a maximum power output of {{cvt|600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} (hence the 600 in the name) and {{cvt|457|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque, achieving a power-to-weight ratio of 479 PS per tonne. Performance figures and production numbers of the car remain unknown. Production of the 600LT started in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://carbuzz.com/news/meet-the-mclaren-600lt-the-most-savage-sports-series-yet?|title=Meet The McLaren 600LT: The Most Savage Sports Series Yet|author=Martin Bigg|date=28 June 2018|publisher=carbuzz|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 600LT Spider ===\n[[File:McLaren 600LT Spider MSO Genf 2019 1Y7A5301.jpg|thumb|McLaren 600LT Spider]]\n\nIn January 2019, McLaren unveiled the convertible variant of the 600LT at the Detroit Auto Show. Due to the use of the same carbon monocoque as the other models in the 570S lineage the 600LT Spider required did not need any extra modifications to incorporate a folding hardtop roof. As a result, the Spider weighs {{cvt|110|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} more than the coup\u00e9 while maintaining the same performance statistics. The Spider has the same engine and aerodynamic components as the coup\u00e9 and share the roof folding mechanism with the standard 570S Spider which can be operated at speeds up to {{cvt|25|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\nThe car can accelerate to {{cvt|100|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 2.9 seconds, to {{cvt|124|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 8.4 seconds (0.2 seconds more than the coup\u00e9) and can attain a top speed of {{cvt|196|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with the roof retracted and {{cvt|201|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with the roof closed.\n\nThe car can achieve a dry weight of {{cvt|1297|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} when equipped with the MSO ClubSport package which includes the removal of air-conditioning and radio, titanium wheel nuts and the replacement of the standard seats with the carbon fibre seats from the [[McLaren Senna|Senna]].

McLaren disclosed shortly after the announcement, that the track cars were built alongside their base model. Changes include a new air jack suspension system, racing style aero package, and center-lock magnesium alloys wrapped in [[Pirelli]] racing slicks. McLaren also added a new race style cooling system and radiator, but the powertrain remained unchanged. The GT4 made its racing debut at the British GT Championship in April 2016.

It borrows the roof folding mechanism from the Super Series line-up. The two-piece aluminium roof folds into a compartment located behind the seats of the car leaving the rear buttress in place. The roof folding mechanism takes 30 seconds to fold and unfold and is operable at speeds up to {{cvt|30|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Unlike the 12C Spider and the 650S Spider, the 570S spider required no significant reengineering for the folding roof mechanism because of the carbon monocell used in the 570S. As a result, the 570S Spider is only {{cvt|46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than the coupe. The drivetrain of the Spider remains identical to that of the coupe which results in similar performance to the coup\u00e9 counterpart with the roof up. The Spider has new forged aluminium wheels and three special launch colours namely Vega Blue, Sicilian Yellow and Ventura Orange. Deliveries of the Spider began in late 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/mclaren/570s/19522/new-mclaren-570s-spider-revealed|title=McLaren 570S Spider revealed|first= Jordan|last= Katsianis|publisher= Evo magazine|date= 29 June 2017|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/mclaren/570s-spider|title= McLaren 570S Spider, price and specifications|first= Jesse|last= Crosse|publisher= Auto car|accessdate= 26 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===MSO X===\n\nTo celebrate the Daytona 24 event, McLaren Newport Beach, the US dealer of McLaren commissioned ten bespoke 570S from McLaren Special Operations based on the 570S GT4 race car. The cars dubbed the '''MSO X''' are created to create the feel of the GT4 racer without taking away everyday road usability. The exterior of the car takes heavy influence from the GT4 race car and includes a carbon fibre roof with a functional 'goose neck' air intake mounted on the top which exits from a modified rear fascia, GT4 style rear wing which creates {{cvt|100|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of additional downforce, functional air intakes on the bonnet, tow hooks on the front and rear and a titanium exhaust system. The interior of the car is also designed to simulate the GT4 racer without taking away the creature comforts and includes exposed carbon fibre monocell throughout, carbon fibre racing bucket seats with customizable six point racing harness, Alcantara interior trim and a carbon fibre bulkhead located at the rear to store the helmets of the occupants while keeping the air conditioning system, parking assist, front lift system and GPS navigation system as standard equipment. The storage locker in the dashboard and the storage compartments at the front and rear have been removed in order to accommodate the air intakes and to keep the car feel as close to the race car as possible. All the ten cars feature distinctive liveries inspired by the iconic liveries featuring on the [[McLaren F1 GTR]] which competed in LeMans during the 1990s.

The car shares its Monocell II carbon fibre monocoque chassis with the 570S GT4 race car as well as the engine which, not subject to racing restrictions and ECU changes is now rated at {{convert|620|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} making it McLaren's most powerful sports series model. Other changes include semi-slick Pirelli P zero Trofeo R tyres with track only Pirelli racing slicks being optional, a bare minimum racing interior with the carpeting removed, carbon fibre racing seats with six-point harness, door pull straps, carbon fibre shift paddles, 12 o'clock mark on the steering wheel, McLaren Track Telemetry system (MTT) and deletion of air-conditioning and infotainment system; although they are available as no cost options, adjustable coilover motorsport dampers; which feature 32 individual settings per corner to allow the driver to tailor rebound and compression rates to their preferred settings, stiffer anti-roll bars have and track-focused carbon-ceramic brakes with 390&nbsp;mm brake discs Arther front and 380&nbsp;mm brake discs at the rear with forged aluminum calipers. The adjustable rear wing made from carbon fibre is shared with the 570S GT4 and allows the 620R to generate {{convert|185|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} of downforce at a speed of {{convert|250|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The large wheel sizes of the car (19 inch at the front, 20 inch at the rear) allow for no mechanical adjustment when the standard tires are switched for racing slicks. The rear wing has an integrated third brake light to make the car road legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/mclaren/570s/108610/new-mclaren-620r-unleashed-with-610bhp|title=New McLaren 620R unleashed with 610bhp|date=9 December 2019|first=Jonathan|last=Burn|publisher=Auto Express|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.topgear.com/car-news/supercars/mclaren-620r-basically-cut-price-senna|title=The McLaren 620R is basically a cut-price Senna|date=9 December 2019|first=Stephen|last=Dobie|publisher=[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]]|accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nPerformance figures include 0-{{convert|100|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 2.9 seconds, 0-{{convert|200|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} acceleration time of 8.1 seconds and a top speed of {{convert|322|kph|mph|0|abbr=on}} which is less than the 600LT due to the car's focus on aerodynamic enhancements.
