{"title_page": "Problem of two emperors", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{short description|A problem arising when multiple people claim the title of emperor}}\n[[File:HRE and Byzantine Empire.png|right|thumb|The problem of two emperors mostly concerns the [[medieval]] dispute between the rulers of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (yellow) and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (purple) as to which ruler was the legitimate [[Roman emperor]]. Borders follow the political situation in 1190 AD.]]\nThe '''problem of two emperors''' or '''two-emperors-problem''' (deriving from the [[German language|German]] term '''Zweikaiserproblem'''<ref>The term was introduced in the first major treatise on the issue, by W. Ohnsorge, cf. {{harvnb|Ohnsorge|1947}}.</ref>) is the [[historiographical]] term for the historical contradiction between the idea of the [[universal monarchy|universal]] [[empire]], that there was only ever one true [[emperor]] at any one given time, and the truth that there were often two (or sometimes more) individuals who claimed the position simultaneously. The term is mostly used in regards to [[medieval Europe]], in particular, the long-lasting dispute between the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] in [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperors]] in modern-day Germany and Austria as to which emperor represented the legitimate [[Roman emperor]].\n\nIn the view of medieval Christians, the [[Roman Empire]] was indivisible and its emperor held a somewhat [[hegemony|hegemonic]] position even over Christians who did not live within the formal borders of the empire. Since the collapse of the classical Roman Empire during [[Late antiquity]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] (which represented its surviving provinces in the East) had been recognized by itself, the [[Pope]] and the various new Christian kingdoms throughout Europe as the legitimate Roman Empire. This changed in 797 when Emperor [[Constantine VI]] was deposed and replaced as ruler by his mother, Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], who was not accepted in the West on account of being a woman. Rather than recognizing Irene, [[Pope Leo III]] proclaimed the [[King of the Franks]], [[Charlemagne]], as the Emperor of the Romans in 800 under the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (transfer of empire).\n\nAlthough the two empires eventually relented and recognized each other's rulers as emperors, they never explicitly recognized the other as \"Roman\", with the Byzantines referring to the Holy Roman emperor as the ''Emperor'' (or ''King'') ''of the Franks'' and later as the ''King of Germany'' and the western sources often describing the Byzantine emperor as the ''Emperor of the Greeks'' or the ''Emperor of Constantinople''. Over the course of the centuries after Charlemagne's coronation, the dispute in regards to the imperial title would be one of the most contested issues in Holy Roman\u2013Byzantine politics and though military action rarely resulted because of it, the dispute significantly soured diplomacy between the two empires. This lack of war was probably mostly on account of the geographical distance between the two empires. On occasion, the imperial title would be claimed by neighbors of the Byzantine Empire, such as [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], which often led to military confrontations.\n\nAfter the Byzantine Empire was momentarily overthrown by the Catholic [[Crusades|crusaders]] of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 and supplanted by the [[Latin Empire]], the dispute continued even though both emperors now followed the same religious head for the first time since the dispute began. Though the Latin emperors recognized the Holy Roman emperors as the legitimate Roman emperors, they also claimed the title for themselves, which was not recognized by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in return. [[Pope Innocent III]] eventually accepted the idea of ''divisio imperii'' (division of empire), in which imperial hegemony would be divided into West (the Holy Roman Empire) and East (the Latin Empire). Although the Latin Empire would be destroyed by the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|resurgent Byzantine Empire]] under the [[Palaiologos dynasty]] in 1261, the Palaiologoi never reached the power of the pre-1204 Byzantine Empire and its emperors would ignore the problem of two emperors in favor of closer diplomatic ties with the west due to a need for aid against the many enemies of their empire.\n\nThe problem of two emperors only fully resurfaced after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, after which the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] claimed the imperial dignity as ''Kayser-i R\u00fbm'' (Caesar of the Roman Empire) and aspired to claim universal hegemony. The Ottomans called the Holy Roman emperors by the title ''k\u0131ral'' (king) for one and a half-century, until the Ottoman sultans formally recognized the Holy Roman emperors as emperors in the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] in 1606, an acceptance of ''divisio imperii'', bringing an end to the dispute between Constantinople and Western Europe. After Constantinople's fall the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the later [[Russian Empire]] would also claim the legacy of the Byzantine Empire, with its rulers titling themselves as ''[[Tsar]]'' (deriving from \"Caesar\") and later ''Imperator''. Their claim to the imperial title would be rejected by the Holy Roman emperors until 1726, when Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] recognized it as part of brokering an alliance, though he refused to admit that the two monarchs held equal status.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Political background ===\n[[File:Iren_and_Constantin2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Byzantine rulers [[Constantine VI]] and [[Irene of Athens]] at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787).]]\nFollowing the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, Roman civilization endured in the remaining eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]], often termed by historians as the [[Byzantine Empire]] (though it self-identified simply as the \"Roman Empire\"). As the [[Roman emperors]] had done in antiquity, the [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperors]] saw themselves as universal rulers. The idea was that the world contained one empire (the Roman Empire) and one church and this idea survived despite the collapse of the empire's western provinces. Although the last extensive attempt at putting the theory back into practice had been [[Justinian I]]'s wars of reconquest in the 6th century, which saw the return of Italy and Africa into imperial control, the idea of a great western reconquest remained a dream for Byzantine emperors for centuries.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}}\n\nBecause the empire was constantly threatened at critical frontiers to its north and east, the Byzantines were unable to focus much attention to the west and Roman control would slowly disappear in the west once more. Nevertheless, their claim to the universal empire was acknowledged by temporal and religious authorities in the west, even if this empire couldn't be physically restored. [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gothic]] and [[Francia|Frankish]] kings in the fifth and sixth centuries acknowledged the emperor's suzerainty, as a symbolic acknowledgement of membership in the Roman Empire also enhanced their own status and granted them a position in the perceived world order of the time. As such, Byzantine emperors could still perceive the west as the western part of ''their'' empire, momentarily in barbarian hands, but still formally under their control through a system of recognition and honors bestowed on the western kings by the emperor.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}}\n\nA decisive geopolitical turning point in the relations between East and West was during the long reign of emperor [[Constantine V]] (741\u2013775). Though Constantine V conducted several successful military campaigns against the enemies of his empire, his efforts were centered on the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Muslims]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]], who represented immediate threats. Because of this, the defense of Italy was neglected. The main Byzantine administrative unit in Italy, the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], fell to the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]] in 751, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=57}}\n\nThe collapse of the Exarchate had long-standing consequences. The [[popes]], ostensibly [[Byzantine Papacy|Byzantine vassals]], realized that Byzantine support was no longer a guarantee and increasingly began relying on the major kingdom in the West, the Frankish Kingdom, for support against the Lombards. Byzantine possessions throughout Italy, such as [[Venice]] and [[Naples]], began to raise their own militias and effectively became independent. Imperial authority ceased to be exercised in [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] and religious authority in southern Italy was formally transferred by the emperors from the popes to the [[patriarchs of Constantinople]]. The Mediterranean world, interconnected since the days of Roman Empire of old, had been definitely divided into East and West.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=58}}\n\nIn 797 the young emperor [[Constantine VI]] was arrested, deposed and blinded by his mother and former regent, [[Irene of Athens]]. She then governed the empire as its sole ruler, taking the title ''[[Basileus]]'' rather than the feminine form ''Basilissa'' (used for the empresses who were wives of reigning emperors). At the same time, the political situation in the West was rapidly changing. The Frankish Kingdom had been reorganized and revitalized under king [[Charlemagne]] and [[Pope Leo III]] had refused to recognize Irene as empress, viewing the idea of a woman emperor as an abomination and seeing the position of Roman emperor as vacant. When Charlemagne visited Rome for Christmas in 800 he was treated not as one territorial ruler among others, but as the sole legitimate monarch in Europe and on Christmas Day he was proclaimed and crowned by the Pope Leo III as the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]].{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=60}}\n\n=== Rome and the idea of the Universal Empire ===\n{{Main|Universal monarchy}}\n[[File:Friedrich Kaulbach - Kr\u00f6nung Karls des Gro\u00dfen.jpg|left|thumb|Imperial Coronation of [[Charlemagne]], by [[Friedrich Kaulbach]], 1861]]\nMost of the great empires in history were in one way or another [[Universal monarchy|universal monarchies]], they recognized no other state or empire as equal to them and claimed that the entire world (and all the people in it), or even the entire universe, was theirs to rule by right. Since no empire ever ruled the entire known world, unconquered and unincorporated people were usually treated as either unworthy of further attention since they were [[Barbarian|barbarians]], or they were looked over entirely through imperial ceremonies and ideology disguising reality. The allure of universal empires is the idea of universal peace; if all of humanity is united under one empire, war is theoretically impossible. Though the Roman Empire is an example of a \"universal empire\" in this sense, the idea is not exclusive to the Romans, having been expressed in unrelated entities such as the [[Aztec Empire]] and in earlier realms such as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empires]].{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=4|2003}}\n\nMost \"universal emperors\" justified their ideology and actions through the divine; proclaiming themselves (or being proclaimed by others) as either divine themselves of as appointed on the behalf of the divine, meaning that their rule was theoretically [[Divine right of kings|sanctioned by heaven]]. By tying together religion with the empire and its ruler, obedience to the empire became the same thing as obedience to the divine. Like its predecessors, the [[Ancient Roman religion]] functioned in much the same way, conquerered peoples were expected to participate in the [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]] regardless of their faith before Roman conquest. This imperial cult was threatened by religions such as Christianity (where Jesus Christ is explicitly proclaimed as the \"Lord\"), which is one of the primary reasons for the harsh persecutions of Christians during the early centuries of the Roman Empire; the religion was a direct threat to the ideology of the regime. Although Christianity eventually became the state religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, the imperial ideology was far from unrecognizable after its adoption. Like the previous imperial cult, Christianity now held the empire together and though the emperors were no longer recognized as gods, the emperors had successfully established themselves as the rulers of the Christian church in the place of Christ, still uniting temporal and spiritual authority.{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=4|2003}}\n\nIn the Byzantine Empire, the authority of the emperor as both the rightful temporal ruler of the Roman Empire and the head of Christianity remained unquestioned until the fall of the empire in the 15th century.{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=5|2003}} The Byzantines firmly believed that their emperor was God's appointed ruler and his viceroy on Earth (illustrated in their title as ''Deo coronatus'', \"crowned by God\"), that he was the Roman emperor (''basileus ton Rhomaion''), and as such the highest authority in the world due to his universal and exclusive emperorship. The emperor was an absolute ruler dependent on no one when exercising his power (illustrated in their title as ''[[autokrator]]'', or the Latin ''moderator'').{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=73}} The Emperor was adorned with an aura of holiness and was theoretically not accountable to anyone but God himself. The Emperor's power, as God's viceroy on Earth, was also theoretically unlimited. In essence, Byzantine imperial ideology was simply a christianization of the old Roman imperial ideology, which had also been universal and absolutist.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=74}}\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire collapsed and subsequent Byzantine attempts to retain the west crumbled, the church took the place of the empire in the west and by the time Western Europe emerged from the chaos endured during the 5th to 7th centuries, the Pope was the chief religious authority and the Franks were the chief temporal authority. Charlemagne's coronation as Roman emperor expressed an idea different from the absolutist ideas of the emperors in the Byzantine Empire. Though the eastern emperor retained control of both the temporal empire and the spiritual church, the rise of a new empire in the west was a collaborative effort, Charlemagne's temporal power had been won through his wars, but he had received the imperial crown from the Pope. Both the emperor and the Pope had claims to ultimate authority in Western Europe (the Popes as the successors of [[Saint Peter]] and the emperors as divinely appointed protectors of the church) and though they recognized the authority of each other, their \"dual rule\" would give rise to many controversies (such as the [[Investiture Controversy]] and the rise and fall of several [[Antipope|Antipopes]]).{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=5|2003}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Byzantine dispute ==\n\n=== Carolingian period ===\n\n==== Imperial ideology ====\n[[File:Carolingian and Byzantine Empires 814.png|thumb|The [[Carolingian Empire]] (yellow) and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (purple) in 814 AD.]]\n[[File:Charlemagne_denier_Mayence_812_814.jpg|alt=|thumb|Denarius of [[Francia|Frankish king]] [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned as Roman Emperor ''Karolus Imperator Augustus'' in the year 800 by [[Pope Leo III]] due to, and in opposition to, the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire in the East]] being ruled by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], a woman. His coronation was strongly opposed by the Eastern Empire.]]\nThough the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire itself never stopped referring to themselves as \"Romans\" (''[[Rhomaioi]]''), sources from Western Europe from the coronation of Charlemagne and onwards would deny the Roman legacy of the eastern empire by referring to its inhabitants as \"Greeks\". The idea behind this renaming was that Charlemagne's coronation did not represent a division (''divisio imperii'') of the Roman Empire into West and East nor a restoration (''[[renovatio imperii]]'') of the old Western Roman Empire. Rather, Charlemagne's coronation was the transfer (''[[translatio imperii]]'') of the ''imperium Romanum'' from the Greeks in the east to the Franks in the west.{{Sfn|Lamers|2015|p=65}} To contemporaries in Western Europe, Charlemagne's key legitimizing factor as emperor (other than papal approval) was the territories which he controlled. As he controlled formerly Roman lands in Gaul, Germany and Italy (including Rome itself), and acted as a true emperor in these lands, which the eastern emperor was seen as having had abandoned, he thus deserved to be called an emperor.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nAlthough crowned as an explicit refusal of the eastern emperor's claim to universal rule, Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been interested in confrontation with the Byzantine Empire or its rulers.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} When Charlemagne was crowned by Pope Leo III, the title he was bestowed with was simply ''Imperator''.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} When he wrote to Constantinople in 813, Charlemagne titled himself as the \"Emperor and [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] and also King of the Franks and of the Lombards\", identifying the imperial title with his previous royal titles in regards to the Franks and Lombards, rather than to the Romans. As such, his imperial title could be seen as stemming from the fact that he was the king of more than one kingdom (equating the title of emperor with that of [[King of Kings|king of kings]]), rather than as an usurpation of Byzantine power.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nOn his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is ''Karolus Imperator Augustus'' and in his own documents he used ''Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium'' (\"August Emperor, governing the Roman Empire\") and ''serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium'' (\"most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans\").{{sfn|Velde|2002}} The identification as an \"emperor governing the Roman Empire\" rather than a \"Roman emperor\" could be seen as an attempt at avoiding the dispute and issue over who was the true emperor and attempting to keep the perceived unity of the empire intact.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nIn response to the Frankish adoption of the imperial title, the Byzantine emperors (which had previously simply used \"Emperor\" as a title) adopted the full title of \"Emperor of the Romans\" to make their supremacy clear.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} To the Byzantines, Charlemagne's coronation was a rejection of their perceived order of the world and an act of usurpation. Although Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe|Michael I]] eventually relented and recognized Charlemagne as an emperor and a \"spiritual brother\" of the eastern emperor, Charlemagne was not recognized as the ''Roman'' emperor and his ''imperium'' was seen as limited to his actual domains (as such not universal) and not as something that would outlive him (with his successors being referred to as \"kings\" rather than emperors in Byzantine sources).{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=320}}\n\nFollowing Charlemagne's coronation, the two empires engaged in diplomacy with each other. The exact terms discussed are unknown and negotiations were slow but it seems that Charlemagne proposed in 802 that the two rulers would marry and unite their empires.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=61}} As such, the empire could have \"reunited\" without arguments as to which ruler was the legitimate one.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} This plan failed however, as the message only arrived in Constantinople after Irene had been deposed and exiled by a new emperor, [[Nikephoros I]].{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=61}}\n\n==== Louis II and Basil I ====\n[[File:Louis II of Italy.png|left|thumb|Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]]'s (pictured) 871 letter to [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Basil I]] showcased that the two emperors held significantly different ideas of what it meant to be Roman.]]\nOne of the primary resources in regards to the problem of two emperors in the Carolingian period is a letter by Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]]. Louis II was the fourth emperor of the [[Carolingian Empire]], though his domain was confined to northern Italy as the rest of the empire had fractured into several different kingdoms, though these still acknowledged Louis as the emperor. His letter was a reply to a provocative letter by Byzantine emperor [[Basil I the Macedonian]]. Though Basil's letter is lost, its contents can be ascertained from the known geopolitical situation at the time and Louis's reply and probably related to the ongoing co-operation between the two empires against the Muslims. The focal point of Basil's letter was his refusal to recognize Louis II as a Roman emperor.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nBasil appears to have based his refusal on two main points. First of all, the title of Roman emperor was not hereditary (the Byzantines still considered it to formally be a [[Roman Republic|republican]] office, although also tied intimately with religion) and second of all, it wasn't considered appropriate for someone of a ''gens'' (e.g. an ethnicity) to hold the title. The Franks, and other groups throughout Europe, were seen as different ''gentes'' but to Basil and the rest of the Byzantines, \"Roman\" wasn't a ''gens''. Romans were defined chiefly by their lack of a ''gens'' and as such, Louis wasn't Roman and thus not a Roman emperor. There was only one Roman emperor, Basil himself, and though Basil considered that Louis could be an Emperor of the Franks, he appears to have questioned this as well seeing as only the ruler of the Romans was to be titled ''basileus'' (emperor).{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nAs illustrated by Louis's letter, the western idea of ethnicity was different from the Byzantine idea; everyone belonged to some form of ethnicity. Louis considered the ''gens romana'' (Roman people) to be the people who lived in the city of Rome, which he saw as having been deserted by the Byzantine Empire. All ''gentes'' could be ruled by a ''basileus'' in Louis's mind and as he pointed out, the title (which had originally simply meant \"king\") had been applied to other rulers in the past (notably Persian rulers). Furthermore, Louis disagreed with the notion that someone of a ''gens'' could not become the Roman emperor. He considered the ''gentes'' of [[Hispania]] (the [[Theodosian dynasty]]), [[Isauria]] (the [[Isaurian dynasty]]) and [[Khazaria]] ([[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]]) as all having provided emperors, though the Byzantines themselves would have seen all of these as Romans and not as peoples of ''gentes''. The views expressed by the two emperors in regards to ethnicity are somewhat paradoxical; Basil defined the Roman Empire in ethnic terms (defining it as explicitly against ethnicity) despite not considering the Romans as an ethnicity and Louis did not define the Roman Empire in ethnic terms (defining it as an empire of God, the creator of all ethnicities) despite considering the Romans as an ethnic people.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\n[[File:Pope Sergius II Illustration.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]] had been crowned as emperor by [[Pope Sergius II]] (pictured). The support of the [[papacy]] was one of the key factors from which the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]], and later [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman]], emperors derived their legitimacy.]]\nLouis also derived legitimacy from religion. He argued that as the Pope of Rome, who actually controlled the city, had rejected the religious leanings of the Byzantines as heretical and instead favored the Franks and because the Pope had also crowned him emperor, Louis was the legitimate Roman emperor. The idea was that it was God himself, acting through his vicar the Pope, who had granted the church, people and city of Rome to him to govern and protect.{{Sfn|West|2016}} Louis's letter details that if he wasn't the Emperor of the Romans then he could not be the Emperor of the Franks either, as it was the Roman people themselves who had accorded his ancestors with the imperial title. In contrast to the Papal affirmation of his imperial lineage, Louis chastized the eastern empire for its emperors mostly only being affirmed by their [[Byzantine Senate|senate]] and sometimes lacking even that, with some emperors having been proclaimed by the army, or worse, women (probably a reference to Irene). Louis probably overlooked that affirmation by the army was the original ancient source for the title of ''[[Imperator]]'', before it came to mean the ruler of the Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=48}}\n\nThough it would have been possible for either side of the dispute to concede to the obvious truth, that there were now two empires and two emperors, this would have denied the understood nature of what the empire was and meant (its unity).{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} Although Louis's letter does offer some evidence that he might have recognized the political situation as such; Louis is referred to as the \"August Emperor of the Romans\" and Basil is referred to as the \"very glorious and pious emperor of New Rome\",{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=49}} and he suggests that the \"indivisible empire\" is the empire of God and that \"God has not granted this church to be steered either by me or you alone, but so that we should be bound to each other with such love that we cannot be divided, but should seem to exist as one\".{{Sfn|West|2016}} These references are more likely to mean that Louis still considered there to be a single empire, but with two imperial claimants (an emperor and an anti-emperor so to speak). Neither side in the dispute would have been willing to reject the idea of the single empire. His titling of the Byzantine emperor as an emperor in the letter may simply be a courtesy, rather than an implication that he truly accepted his imperial rule.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}}\n\nLouis's letter mentions that the Byzantines abandoned Rome, the seat of empire, and lost the Roman way of life and the Latin language. In his view, that the empire was ruled from Constantinople did not represent it surviving, but rather that it had fled from its responsibilities.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=49}} Although he would have had to approve its contents, Louis probably did not write his letter himself and it was probably instead written by the prominent cleric [[Anastasius the Librarian]]. Anastasius was not a Frank but a citizen of the city of Rome (in Louis's view an \"ethnic Roman\"). As such, prominent figures in Rome itself would have shared Louis's views, illustrating that by his time, the Byzantine Empire and the city of Rome had drifted very far apart.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nFollowing the death of Louis in 875, emperors continued to be crowned in the West for a few decades, but their reigns were often brief and problematic and they only held limited power and as such the problem of two emperors ceased being a major issue to the Byzantines, for a time.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1987|p=285}}\n\n=== Ottonian period ===\n[[File:Nikiphoros Phokas.jpg|left|thumb|Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (pictured) was outraged at the Papal coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] and vowed to reconquer Italy and force the Pope to submit to him.]]\nThe problem of two emperors returned when [[Pope John XII]] crowned the King of Germany, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], as Emperor of the Romans in 962, almost 40 years after the death of the previous papally crowned emperor, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar]]. Otto's repeated territorial claims to all of Italy and Sicily (as he had also been proclaimed as the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]]) brought him into conflict with the Byzantine Empire.{{Sfn|Gibbs|Johnson|2002|p=62}} The Byzantine emperor at the time, [[Romanos II]], appears to have more or less ignored Otto's imperial aspirations, but the succeeding Byzantine emperor, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros II]], was strongly opposed to them. Otto, who hoped to secure imperial recognition and the provinces in southern Italy diplomatically through a marriage alliance, dispatched diplomatic envoys to Nikephoros in 967.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1987|p=285}} To the Byzantines, Otto's coronation was a blow as, or even more, serious than Charlemagne's as Otto and his successors insisted on the Roman aspect of their ''imperium'' more strongly than their Carolingian predecessors.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=321}}\n\nLeading Otto's diplomatic mission was [[Liutprand of Cremona]], who chastized the Byzantines for their perceived weakness; losing control of the West and thus also causing the Pope to lose control of the lands which belonged to him. To Liutprand, the fact that Otto I had acted as a restorer and protector of the church by restoring the [[Papal States|lands of the Papacy]] (which Liutprand believed had been granted to the Pope by Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]]), made him the true emperor while the loss of these lands under preceding Byzantine rule illustrated that the Byzantines were weak and unfit to be emperors.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}} Liutprand expresses his ideas with the following words in [[wikisource:Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages/Appendix|his report]] on the mission, in a reply to Byzantine officials:{{Sfn|Halsall|1996}}{{Cquote\n| quote = My master did not by force or tyrannically invade the city of Rome; but he freed it from a tyrant, nay, from the yoke of tyrants.

If they were powerful, if emperors of the Romans, why did they permit Rome to be [[Saeculum obscurum|in the hands of harlots]]? Were not some of them most holy popes banished, others so oppressed that they were not able to have their daily supplies or the means of giving alms? Did not Adalbert send scornful letters to the emperors Romanus and [[Constantine VII|Constantine]] your predecessors? Did he not plunder the churches of the most holy apostles? What one of you emperors, led by zeal for God, took care to avenge so unworthy a crime and to bring back the holy church to its proper conditions You neglected it, my master did not neglect it. For, rising from the ends of the earth and coming to Rome, he removed the impious and gave back to the vicars of the holy apostles their power and all their honor...\n}}\nNikephoros pointed out to Liutprand personally that Otto was a mere barbarian king who had no right to call himself an emperor, nor to call himself a Roman.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=318}} Just before Liutprand's arrival in Constantinople, Nikephoros II had received an offensive letter from [[Pope John XIII]], possibly written under pressure from Otto, in which the Byzantine emperor was referred to as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\" and not the \"Emperor of the Romans\", denying his true imperial status. Liutprand recorded the outburst of Nikephoros's representatives at this letter, which illustrates that the Byzantines too had developed an idea similar to ''translatio imperii'' regarding the transfer of power from Rome to Constantinople:{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}}{{Cquote\n| quote = Hear then!

Otto leaving out any mention of Romans in his imperial title may be because he wanted to achieve the recognition of the Byzantine emperor. Following Otto's reign, mentions of the Romans in the imperial title became more common. In the 11th century, the German king (the title held by those who were later crowned emperors) was referred to as the ''Rex Romanorum'' (\"[[King of the Romans]]\") and in the century after that, the standard imperial title was ''dei gratia Romanorum Imperator semper Augustus'' (\"By the Grace of God, Emperor of the Romans, ever August\").{{sfn|Velde|2002}}\n\n=== Hohenstaufen period ===\nTo Liutprand of Cremona and later scholars in the west, the perceived weak and degenerate eastern emperors were not true emperors; there was a single empire under the true emperors (Otto I and his successors), who demonstrated their right to the empire through their restoration of the Church. In return, the eastern emperors did not recognize the imperial status of their challengers in the west. Although [[Michael I Rangabe|Michael I]] had referred to Charlemagne by the title ''Basileus'' in 812, he hadn't referred to him as the ''Roman'' emperor. ''Basileus'' in of itself was far from an equal title to that of Roman emperor. In their own documents, the only emperor recognized by the Byzantines was their own ruler, the Emperor of the Romans. In [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''[[The Alexiad]]'' ({{Circa|1148}}), the Emperor of the Romans is her father, [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], while the Holy Roman emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] is titled simply as the \"King of Germany\".{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=51}}\n\nIn the 1150s, the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] became involved in a three-way struggle between himself, the Holy Roman emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] and the [[Italo-Norman]] [[King of Sicily]], [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. Manuel aspired to lessen the influence of his two rivals and at the same time win the recognition of the Pope (and thus by extension Western Europe) as the sole legitimate emperor, which would unite Christendom under his sway. Manuel reached for this ambitious goal by financing a [[Lombard League|league of Lombard towns]] to rebel against Frederick and encouraging dissident Norman barons to do the same against the Sicilian king. Manuel even dispatched his army to southern Italy, the last time a Byzantine army ever set foot in Western Europe. Despite his efforts, Manuel's campaign ended in failure and he won little except the hatred of both Barbarossa and Roger, who by the time the campaign concluded had allied with each other.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=15}}\n\n==== Frederick Barbarossa's crusade ====\n{{See also|Third Crusade}}{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Friedrich I.

Isaac learnt that Barbarossa, a known foe of his empire, was to lead a large contingent in the footprints of the First and Second crusades through the Byzantine Empire. Isaac II interpreted Barbarossa's march through his empire as a threat and considered it inconceivable that Barbarossa did not also intend to overthrow the Byzantine Empire.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=176}} As a result of his fears, Isaac II imprisoned numerous Latin citizens in Constantinople.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}} In his treaties and negotiations with Barbarossa (which exist preserved as written documents), Isaac II was insincere as he had secretly allied with Saladin to gain concessions in the Holy Land and had agreed to delay and destroy the German army.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}}\n\nBarbarossa, who did not in fact intend to take Constantinople, was unaware of Isaac's alliance with Saladin but still wary of the rival emperor. As such he sent out an embassy in early 1189, headed by the Bishop of M\u00fcnster.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}} Isaac was absent at the time, putting down a revolt in [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]], and returned to Constantinople a week after the German embassy arrived, after which he immediately had the Germans imprisoned. This imprisonment was partly motivated by Isaac wanting to possess German hostages, but more importantly, an embassy from Saladin, probably noticed by the German ambassadors, was also in the capital at this time.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=178}}\n\nOn 28 June 1189, Barbarossa's crusade reached the Byzantine borders, the first time a Holy Roman emperor personally set foot within the borders of the Byzantine Empire. Although Barbarossa's army was received by the closest major governor, the governor of Branitchevo, the governor had received orders to stall or, if possible, destroy the German army. On his way to the city of [[Ni\u0161]], Barbarossa was repeatedly assaulted by locals under the orders of the governor of Branitchevo and Isaac II also engaged in a campaign of closing roads and destroying foragers.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=178}} The attacks against Barbarossa amounted to little and only resulted in around a hundred losses. A more serious issue was a lack of supplies, since the Byzantines refused to provide markets for the German army. The lack of markets was excused by Isaac as due to not having received advance notice of Barbarossa's arrival, a claim rejected by Barbarossa, who saw the embassy he had sent earlier as notice enough. Despite these issues, Barbarossa still apparently believed that Isaac was not hostile against him and refused invitations from the enemies of the Byzantines to join an alliance against them. While at Ni\u0161 he was assured by Byzantine ambassadors that though there was a significant Byzantine army assembled near Sofia, it had been assembled to fight the Serbs and not the Germans. This was a lie, and when the Germans reached the position of this army, they were treated with hostility, though the Byzantines fled at the first charge of the German cavalry.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=179}}\n\n[[File:The Third Crusade (1189-1192).png|left|thumb|Path of the [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u20131192), Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]]'s path in red.]]\nIsaac II panicked and issued contradictory orders to the governor of the city of [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philippopolis]], one of the strongest fortresses in [[Thrace]]. Fearing that the Germans were to use the city as a base of operations, its governor, [[Niketas Choniates]] (later a major historian of these events), was first ordered to strengthen the city's walls and hold the fortress at all costs, but later to abandon the city and destroy its fortifications. Isaac II seems to have been unsure of how to deal with Barbarossa. Barbarossa meanwhile wrote to the main Byzantine commander, [[Manuel Kamytzes]], that \"resistance was in vain\", but also made clear that he had absolutely no intention to harm the Byzantine Empire. On 21 August, a letter from Isaac II reached Barbarossa, who was encamped outside Philippopolis. In the letter, which caused great offense, Isaac II explicitly called himself the \"Emperor of the Romans\" in opposition to Barbarossa's title and the Germans also misinterpreted the Byzantine emperor as calling himself an angel (on account of his last name, Angelos). Furthermore, Isaac II demanded half of any territory to be conquered from the Muslims during the crusade and justified his actions by claiming that he had heard from the governor of Branitchevo that Barbarossa had plans to conquer the Byzantine Empire and place his son [[Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia|Frederick of Swabia]] on its throne. At the same time Barbarossa learnt of the imprisonment of his earlier embassy.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=180}} Several of Barbarossa's barons suggested that they take immediate military action against the Byzantines, but Barbarossa preferred a diplomatic solution.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=181}}\n\nIn the letters exchanged between Isaac II and Barbarossa, neither side titled the other in the way they considered to be appropriate. In his first letter, Isaac II referred to Barbarossa simply as the \"King of Germany\". The Byzantines eventually realized that the \"wrong\" title hardly improved the tense situation and in the second letter Barbarossa was called \"the most high-born Emperor of Germany\". Refusing to recognize Barbarossa as ''the'' Roman emperor, the Byzantines eventually relented with calling him \"the most noble emperor of Elder Rome\" (as opposed to the New Rome, Constantinople). The Germans always referred to Isaac II as the Greek emperor or the Emperor of Constantinople.{{Sfn|Loud|2010|p=79}}\n\n[[File:1191 - Fridrich Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] depicted during the [[Third Crusade]].]]\nThe Byzantines continued to harass the Germans. The wine left behind in the abandoned city of Philippopolis had been poisoned, and a second embassy sent from the city to Constantinople by Barbarossa was also imprisoned, though shortly thereafter Isaac II relented and released both embassies. When the embassies reunited with Barbarossa at Philippopolis they told the Holy Roman emperor of Isaac II's alliance with Saladin, and claimed that the Byzantine emperor intended to destroy the German army while it was crossing the [[Bosporus]]. In retaliation for spotting anti-Crusader propaganda in the surrounding region, the crusaders devastated the immediate area around Philippopolis, slaughtering the locals. After Barbarossa was addressed as the \"King of Germany\", he flew into a fit of rage, demanding hostages from the Byzantines (including Isaac II's son and family), asserting that he was the one true Emperor of the Romans and made it clear that he intended to winter in Thrace despite the Byzantine emperor's offer of assisting the German army to cross the Bosporus.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=182}}\n\nBy this point, Barbarossa had become convinced that Constantinople needed to be conquered in order for the crusade to be successful. On 18 November he sent a letter to his son, Henry, in which he explained to difficulties he had encountered and ordered his son to prepare for an attack against Constantinople, ordering the assembling of a large fleet to meet him in the Bosporus once spring came. Furthermore, Henry was instructed to ensure Papal support for such a campaign, organizing a great Western crusade against the Byzantines as enemies of God. Isaac II replied to Barbarossa's threats by claiming that Thrace would be Barbarossa's \"deathtrap\" and that it was too late for the German emperor to escape \"his nets\". As Barbarossa's army, reinforced with Serbian and [[Vlach]] allies, approached Constantinople, Isaac II's resolve faded and he began to favor peace instead.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=184}} Barbarossa had continued to send offers of peace and reconciliation since he had seized Philippopolis, and once Barbarossa officially sent a declaration of war in late 1189, Isaac II at last relented, realizing he wouldn't be able to destroy the German army and was at risk of losing Constantinople itself. The peace saw the Germans being allowed to pass freely through the empire, transportation across the Bosporus and the opening of markets as well as compensation for the damage done to Barbarossa's expedition by the Byzantines.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=185}} Frederick then continued on towards the Holy Land without any further major incidents with the Byzantines, with the exception of the German army almost sacking the city of Philadelphia after its governor refused to open up the markets to the Crusaders.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=187}} The incidents during the Third Crusade heightened animosity between the Byzantine Empire and the west. To the Byzantines, the devastation of Thrace and efficiency of the German soldiers had illustrated the threat they represented, while in the West, the mistreatment of the emperor and the imprisonment of the embassies would be long remembered.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=188}}\n\n==== Threats of Henry VI ====\n[[File:Henry VI HRE suzerainty.png|right|thumb|Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] nearly succeeded in uniting Christianity under his own sway, ruling all of Germany and Italy as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]] and [[King of Sicily]], formally vassalizing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] and receiving recognitions of suzerainty by the kingdoms of [[Angevin Empire|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]]. He also extracted tribute from the [[Byzantine Empire]], which he might have aspired to eventually conquer.]]\nFrederick Barbarossa died before reaching the Holy Land and his son and successor, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], pursued a foreign policy in which he aimed to force the Byzantine court to accept him as the superior (and sole legitimate) emperor.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=64}} By 1194, Henry had successfully consolidated Italy under his own rule after being crowned as King of Sicily, in addition to already being the Holy Roman emperor and the King of Italy, and he turned his gaze east. The Muslim world had fractured after Saladin's death and Barbarossa's crusade had revealed the Byzantine Empire to be weak and also given a useful ''casus belli'' for attack. Furthermore, [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo II]], the ruler of [[Cilician Armenia]], offered to swear fealty to Henry VI in exchange for being accorded a royal crown.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=189}} Henry bolstered his efforts against the eastern empire by marrying a captive daughter of Isaac II, [[Irene Angelina]], to his brother [[Philip of Swabia]] in 1195, giving his brother a dynastic claim that could prove useful in the future.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=190}}\n\nIn 1195 Henry VI also dispatched an embassy to the Byzantine Empire, demanding from Isaac II that he transfer a stretch of land stretching from [[Durazzo]] to [[Thessalonica]], previously conquered by the Sicilian king William II, and also wished the Byzantine emperor to promise naval support in preparation for a new crusade. According to Byzantine historians, the German ambassadors spoke as if Henry VI was the \"emperor of emperors\" and \"lord of lords\". Henry VI intended to force the Byzantines to pay him to ensure peace, essentially extracting tribute, and his envoys put forward the grievances that the Byzantines had caused throughout Barbarossa's reign. Not in a position to resist, Isaac II succeeded to modify the terms so that they were purely monetary. Shortly after agreeing to these terms, Isaac II was overthrown and replaced as emperor by his older brother, [[Alexios III Angelos]].{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=191}}\n\nHenry VI successfully compelled Alexios III as well [[Alamanikon|to pay tribute to him]] under the threat of otherwise conquering Constantinople on his way to the Holy Land.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=192}} Henry VI had grand plans of becoming the leader of the entire Christian world. Although he would only directly rule his traditional domains, Germany and Italy, his plans were that no other empire would claim [[Ecumene|ecumenical]] power and that all Europe was to recognize his suzerainty. His attempt to subordinate the Byzantine Empire to himself was just one step in his partially successful plan of extending his feudal overlordship from his own domains to France, England, Aragon, Cilician Armenia, Cyprus and the Holy Land.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=193}} Based on the establishment of bases in the Levant and the submission of Cilician Armenia and Cyprus, it is possible that Henry VI really considered  invading and conquering the Byzantine Empire, thus uniting the rivalling empires under his rule. This plan, just as Henry's plan of making the position of emperor hereditary rather than elective, ultimately never transpired as he was kept busy by internal affairs in Sicily and Germany.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=194}}\n\nThe threat of Henry VI caused some concern in the Byzantine Empire and Alexios III slightly altered his imperial title to ''en Christoi to theo pistos basileus theostephes anax krataios huspelos augoustos kai autokrator Romaion'' in Greek and ''in Christo Deo fidelis imperator divinitus coronatus sublimis potens excelsus semper augustus moderator Romanorum'' in Latin. Though previous Byzantine emperors had used ''basileus kai autokrator Romaion'' (\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\"), Alexios III's title separated ''basileus'' from the rest and replaced its position with ''augoustos'' (''Augustus'', the old Roman imperial title), creating the possible interpretation that Alexios III was simply ''an'' emperor (''Basileus'') and besides that also the ''moderator Romanorum'' (\"Autocrat of the Romans\") but not explicitly ''the'' Roman emperor, so that he was no longer in direct competition with his rival in Germany and that his title was less provocative to the West in general. Alexios III's successor, Alexios IV Angelos, continued with this practice and went even further, inverting the order of ''moderator Romanorum'' and rendering it as ''Romanorum moderator''.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=64}}\n\n==== The Latin Empire ====\n[[File:Fourth Crusade and foundation of the Latin Empire.png|thumb|The path of the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) and the political situation within the borders of the former [[Byzantine Empire]] after its victory.]]\nA series of unfortunate events and the intervention of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] led to the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) [[Sack of Constantinople|sacking Constantinople]] instead of attacking its intended target, Egypt. When the crusaders seized Constantinople in 1204, they founded the [[Latin Empire]] and called their new realm the ''imperium Constantinopolitanum'', the same term used for the Byzantine Empire in Papal correspondence. This suggests that, although they had placed a new Catholic emperor, [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], on the throne of Constantinople and changed the administrative structure of the empire into a feudal network of counties, duchies and kingdoms, the crusaders viewed themselves as taking over the Byzantine Empire rather than replacing it with a new entity.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=61}} Notably Baldwin I was designated as an emperor, not a king. This is despite the fact that the crusaders, as Western Christians, would have recognized the Holy Roman Empire as the true Roman Empire and its ruler as the sole true emperor and that founding treaties of the Latin Empire explicitly designate the empire as in the service of the Roman Catholic Church.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=62}}\n\n[[File:Imperial_seal_of_Balwin_I.png|alt=|thumb|Seal of [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], the first [[Latin Emperor]]. The abbreviation ''Rom.'' conveniently leaves it open to interpretation if he refers to ''Romaniae'' (\"Romania\") or ''Romanorum'' (\"the Romans\").]]\nThe rulers of the Latin Empire, although they seem to have called themselves Emperors of Constantinople (''imperator Constantinopolitanus'') or Emperors of Romania (''imperator Romaniae'', Romania being a Byzantine term meaning the \"land of the Romans\") in correspondence with the Papacy, used the same imperial titles within their own empire as their direct Byzantine predecessors, with the titles of the Latin Emperors (''Dei gratia fidelissimus in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus'') being near identical to the Latin version of the title of Byzantine emperor Alexios IV (''fidelis in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus'').{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=63}} As such, the titles of the Latin emperors continued the compromise in titulature worked out by Alexios III.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=64}} In his seals, Baldwin I abbreviated ''Romanorum'' as ''Rom''., a convenient and slight adjustment that left it open to interpretation if it truly referred to ''Romanorum'' or if it meant ''Romaniae''.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=63}}\n\nThe Latin Emperors saw the term ''Romanorum'' or ''Romani'' in a new light, not seeing it as referring to the Western idea of \"geographic Romans\" (inhabitants of the city of Rome) but not adopting the Byzantine idea of the \"ethnic Romans\" (Greek-speaking citizens of the Byzantine Empire) either. Instead, they saw the term as a political identity encapsulating all subjects of the Roman emperor, i.e. all the subjects of their multi-national empire (whose ethnicities encompassed Latins, \"Greeks\", Armenians and Bulgarians).{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=75}}\n\nThe embracing of the Roman nature of the emperorship in Constantinople would have brought the Latin emperors into conflict with the idea of ''translatio imperii''. Furthermore, the Latin emperors claimed the dignity of ''Deo coronatus'' (as the Byzantine emperors had claimed before them), a dignity the Holy Roman emperors could not claim, being dependent on the Pope for their coronation. Despite the fact that the Latin emperors would have recognized the Holy Roman Empire as ''the'' Roman Empire, they nonetheless claimed a position that was at least equal to that of the Holy Roman emperors.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=76}} In 1207\u20131208, Latin emperor [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]] proposed to marry the daughter of the elected ''rex Romanorum'' in the Holy Roman Empire, Henry VI's brother Philip of Swabia, yet to be crowned emperor due to an ongoing struggle with the rival claimant [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]]. Philip's envoys responded that Henry was an ''advena'' (stranger; outsider) and ''solo nomine imperator'' (emperor in name only) and that the marriage proposal would only be accepted if Henry recognized Philip as the ''imperator Romanorum'' and ''suus dominus'' (his master). As no marriage occurred, it is clear that submission to the Holy Roman emperor was not considered an option.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=77}}\n\nThe emergence of the Latin Empire and the submission of Constantinople to the Catholic Church as facilitated by its emperors altered the idea of ''translatio imperii'' into what was called ''divisio imperii'' (division of empire). The idea, which became accepted by [[Pope Innocent III]], saw the formal recognition of Constantinople as an imperial seat of power and its rulers as legitimate emperors, which could rule in tandem with the already recognized emperors in the West. The idea resulted in that the Latin emperors never attempted to enforce any religious or political authority in the West, but attempted to enforce a hegemonic religious and political position, similar to that held by the Holy Roman emperors in the West, over the lands in Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, especially in regards to the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]], where the Latin emperors would oppose the local claims of the Holy Roman emperors.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=77}}\n\n=== Restoration of the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Michael VIII Palaiologos (head).jpg|left|thumb|Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured [[Constantinople]] from the [[Latin Empire]] in 1261. Michael and [[Palaiologos|his dynasty]] would pursue a policy of reconciliation with the west, much to the dismay of their subjects.]]\nWith the Byzantine [[reconquest of Constantinople]] in 1261 under Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the Papacy suffered a loss of prestige and endured severe damage to its spiritual authority. Once more, the easterners had asserted their right not only to the position of Roman emperor but also to a church independent of the one centered in Rome. The popes who were active during Michael's reign all pursued a policy of attempting to assert their religious authority over the Byzantine Empire. As Michael was aware that the popes held considerable sway in the west (and wishing to avoid a repeat of the events of 1204), he dispatched an embassy to [[Pope Urban IV]] immediately after taking possession of the city. The two envoys were immediately imprisoned once they sat foot in Italy: one was flayed alive and the other managed to escape back to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=140f}} From 1266 to his death in 1282, Michael would repeatedly be threatened by the King of Sicily, [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]], who aspired to restore the Latin Empire and periodically enjoyed Papal support.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=189f}}\n\nMichael VIII and his successors, the [[Palaiologan dynasty]], aspired to reunite the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] with the Church of Rome, chiefly because Michael recognized that only the Pope could constrain Charles of Anjou. To this end, Byzantine envoys were present at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] in 1274, where the Church of Constantinople was formally reunified with Rome, restoring communion after more than two centuries.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=258\u2013264}} On his return to Constantinople, Michael was taunted with the words \"you have become a [[Franks#Legacy|Frank]]\", which remains a term in Greek to taunt converts to Catholicism to this day.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=338}} The Union of the Churches aroused passionate opposition from the Byzantine people, the Orthodox clergy, and even within the imperial family itself. Michael's sister [[Irene Komnene Palaiologina|Eulogia]], and her daughter Anna, wife of the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]], were among the chief leaders of the anti-Unionists. Nikephoros, his half-brother [[John I Doukas of Thessaly]], and even the [[Emperor of Trebizond]], [[John II of Trebizond|John II Megas Komnenos]], soon joined the anti-Unionist cause and gave support to the anti-Unionists fleeing Constantinople.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=264\u2013275}}\n\nNevertheless, the Union achieved Michael's main aim: it legitimized Michael and his successors as rulers of Constantinople in the eyes of the west. Furthermore, Michael's idea of a crusade to recover the lost portions of Anatolia received positive reception at the council, though such a campaign would never materialize.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=286\u2013290}} The union was disrupted in 1281 when Michael was excommunicated, possibly due to [[Pope Martin IV]] having been pressured by Charles of Anjou.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=341}} Following Michael's death, and with the threat of an Angevin invasion having subsided following the [[Sicilian Vespers]], his successor, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], was quick to repudiate the hated Union of the Churches.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=194}} Although popes after Michael's death would periodically consider a new crusade against Constantinople to once more impose Catholic rule, no such plans materialized.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=332}}\n\nAlthough Michael VIII, unlike his predecessors, did not protest when addressed as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\" by the popes in letters and at the Council of Lyons, his conception of his universal emperorship remained unaffected.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}} As late as 1395, when Constantinople was more or less surrounded by the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|rapidly expanding]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and it was apparent that its fall was a matter of time, Patriarch [[Antony IV of Constantinople]] still referenced the idea of the universal empire in a letter to the [[Grand Prince of Moscow]], [[Vasily I of Moscow|Vasily I]], stating that anyone other than the Byzantine emperor assuming the title of \"emperor\" was \"illegal\" and \"unnatural\".{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=316}}\n\nFaced with the Ottoman danger, Michael's successors, prominently [[John V Palaiologos|John V]] and [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]], periodically attempted to restore the Union, much to the dismay of their subjects. At the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]] reaffirmed the Union in the light of imminent Turkish attacks on what little remained of his empire. To the Byzantine citizens themselves, the Union of the Churches, which had assured the promise of a great western crusade against the Ottomans, was a death warrant for their empire. John VIII had betrayed their faith and as such their entire imperial ideology and world view. The promised [[Crusade of Varna|crusade]], the fruit of John VIII's labor, ended only in disaster as it was defeated by the Turks at the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=333}}\n\n== Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian dispute ==\n[[File:Skylitzes - Sime\u00f3n el Grande crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] (and some of his successors) would challenge the [[Byzantine Empire]] for the universal emperorship, adopting the title \"Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans\" in 913.]]\nThe dispute between the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire was mostly confined to the realm of diplomacy, never fully exploding into open war. This was probably mainly due to the great geographical distance separating the two empires; a large-scale campaign would have been infeasible to undertake for either emperor.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=325}} Events in Germany, France and the west in general was of little compelling interest to the Byzantines as they firmly believed that the western provinces would eventually be reconquered.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}} Of more compelling interest were political developments in their near vicinity and in 913, the ''Knyaz'' (prince or king) of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], arrived at the walls of Constantinople with an army. Simeon I's demands were not only that Bulgaria would be recognized as independent from the Byzantine Empire, but that it was to be designated as a new universal empire, absorbing and replacing the universal empire of Constantinople. Because of the threat represented, the Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Nicholas Mystikos]], granted an imperial crown to Simeon. Simeon was designated as the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'', not ''of the Romans'' and as such, the diplomatic gesture had been somewhat dishonest.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=325}}\n\nThe Byzantines soon discovered that Simeon was in fact titling himself as not only the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'', but as the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans''. The problem was solved when Simeon died in 927 and his son and successor, Peter I, simply adopted ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'' as a show of submission to the universal empire of Constantinople. The problem, deriving from Simeon's claim, would on occasion be revived by strong Bulgarian monarchs who once more adopted the title of ''Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans'', such as [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] ({{Reign}}1196\u20131207) and [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] ({{Reign}}1218\u20131241).{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}} Kaloyan attempted to receive recognition by [[Pope Innocent III]] as emperor, but Innocent refused, instead offering to provide a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] to crown him simply as king.{{sfn|Sweeney|1973|pp=322\u2013324}} Simeon's claim was also momentarily revived by the rulers of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]] in 1346 with [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]'s coronation as ''Emperor of the Serbs and Romans''.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Ottoman dispute ==\n[[File:Gennadios_II_and_Mehmed_II.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] (left, depicted with Patriarch [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]] to his right) claimed the legacy of the [[Byzantine Empire]] upon his [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453.

Mehmed deliberately linked himself to the Byzantine imperial tradition, making few changes in Constantinople itself and working on restoring the city through repairs and (sometimes forced) immigration, which soon led to an economic upswing. Mehmed also appointed a new Greek Orthodox Patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]], and began minting his own coins (a practice which the Byzantine emperors had engaged in, but the Ottomans never had previously). Furthermore, Mehmed introduced stricter court ceremonies and protocols inspired by those of the Byzantines.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}}\n\nContemporaries within the Ottoman Empire recognized Mehmed's assumption of the imperial title and his claim to world domination. The historian [[Michael Critobulus]] described the sultan as \"Emperor of Emperors\", \"autocrat\" and \"Lord of the Earth and the sea according to God's will\". In a letter to the [[Doge of Venice]], Mehmed was described by his courtiers as the \"Emperor\". Other titles were sometimes used as well, such as \"Grand Duke\" and \"Prince of the Turkish Romans\".{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} The citizens of Constantinople and the former Byzantine Empire (which would still identify as \"Romans\" and not \"Greeks\" until modern times) saw the Ottoman Empire as still representing their empire, the universal empire; the imperial capital was still Constantinople and its ruler, Mehmed II, was the ''basileus''.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=334}}\n[[File:Wien-khm-kunstkammer-francis1-0.jpg|left|thumb|Marble bust of the final [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], in a style inspired by ancient Roman marble busts.]]\nAs with the Byzantine emperors before them, the imperial status of the Ottoman sultans was primarily expressed through the refusal to recognize the Holy Roman emperors as equal rulers. In diplomacy, the western emperors were titled as ''k\u0131ral'' (kings) of Vienna or Hungary.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} This practice had been cemented and reinforced by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1533)|Treaty of Constantinople]] in 1533, signed by the Ottoman Empire (under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]) and the [[Archduchy of Austria]] (as represented by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] on behalf of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Holy Roman Emperor), wherein it was agreed that Ferdinand I was to be considered as the King of Germany and Charles V as the King of Spain. These titles were considered to be equal in rank to the Ottoman Empire's [[Grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]], subordinate to the imperial title held by the sultan. The treaty also banned its signatories to count anyone as an emperor except the Ottoman sultan.{{Sfn|Shaw|1976|p=94}}\n\nThe problem of two emperors and the dispute between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire would be finally resolved after the two empires signed a peace treaty following a string of Ottoman defeats. In the 1606 [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] Ottoman sultan [[Ahmed I]], for the first time in his empire's history, formally recognized the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] with the title ''[[Padishah]]'' (emperor) rather than ''k\u0131ral''. Ahmed made sure to write \"like a father to a son\", symbolically emphasizing that the eastern empire retained some primacy over its western counterpart.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} In the Ottoman Empire itself, the idea that the sultan was a universal ruler lingered on despite his recognition of the Holy Roman emperor as an equal. Writing in 1798, the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Anthemus of Jerusalem|Anthemus]], saw the Ottoman Empire as imposed by God himself as the supreme empire on Earth and something which had arisen due to the dealings of the Palaiologan emperors with the western Christians:{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=334}}{{Cquote\n| quote = Behold how our merciful and omniscient Lord has managed to preserve the integrity of our holy Orthodox faith and to save (us) all; he brought forth out of nothing the powerful Empire of the Ottomans, which he set up in the place of our Empire of the Romaioi, which had begun in some ways to deviate from the path of the Orthodox faith; and he raised this Empire of the Ottomans above every other in order to prove beyond doubt that it came into being by the will of God .... For there is no authority except that deriving from God.\n}}\nThe Holy Roman idea that the empire located primarily in Germany constituted the only legitimate empire eventually gave rise to the association with Germany and the imperial title, rather than associating it with the ancient Romans. The earliest mention of \"the Holy Roman Empire of ''the German Nation''\" (a phrase rarely used officially) is from the 15th century and its later increasingly used shorthand, ''imperium Romano-Germanicum'', demonstrates that contemporaries of the empire increasingly saw the empire and its emperors not as successors of a Roman Empire that had existed since Antiquity but instead as a new entity that appeared in medieval Germany whose rulers were referred to as \"emperors\" for political and historical reasons. In the 16th century up to modern times, the term \"emperor\" was thus also increasingly applied to rulers of other countries.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} The Holy Roman emperors themselves maintained that they were the successors of the ancient Roman emperors up until the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], the final Holy Roman emperor, in 1806.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=|pp=17\u201320}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Russian dispute ==\n[[File:1-rubl-1723-A.png|thumb|Coin of [[Russian Emperor]] (Tsar) [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], with the emperor being depicted with a [[laurel wreath]], as ancient [[Roman emperors]] were on their coins.]]\nBy the time of the first embassy from the Holy Roman Empire to [[Russian Tsardom|Russia]] in 1488, \"the two-emperor problem had [already] translated to Moscow.\"{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=153}} In 1472, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand Prince of Moscow]], married the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Zoe Palaiologina]], and informally declared himself ''[[tsar]]'' (emperor) of all the Russian principalities.

Hence the idea could not have directly influenced the foreign policies of Peter and Catherine, though those Tsars did compare themselves to the Romans. An expansionist version of Third Rome reappeared primarily after the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1855, a lens through which later Russian writers would re-interpret Early Modern Russia, arguably anachronistically.{{sfn|Poe|1997|pp=4-7}}\n\nPrior to the [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|embassy of Peter the Great in 1697\u20131698]], the tsarist government had a poor understanding of the Holy Roman Empire and its constitution. Under Peter, use of the double-headed eagle increased and other less Byzantine symbols of the Roman past were adopted, as when the tsar was portrayed as an ancient emperor on coins minted after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. The [[Great Northern War]] brought Russia into alliance with several north German princes and Russian troops fought in northern Germany. In 1718, Peter published a letter sent to Tsar [[Vasily III]] by the Holy Roman emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1514 in which the emperor addressed the Russian as ''Kaiser'' and implicitly his equal. In October 1721, he took the title ''imperator''. The Holy Roman emperors refused to recognise this new title. Peter's proposal that the Russian and German monarchs alternate as premier rulers in Europe was also rejected. The Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], supported by France, insisted that there could only be one emperor.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\nIn 1726, Charles VI entered into an alliance with Russia and formally recognized the title of ''imperator'' but without admitting the Russian ruler's parity. Three times between 1733 and 1762 Russian troops fought alongside Austrians inside the empire. The ruler of Russia from 1762 until 1796, [[Catherine the Great]], was a German princess. In 1779 she helped broker the [[Peace of Teschen]] that ended the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]]. Thereafter, Russia claimed to be a [[guarantor of the imperial constitution]] as per the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) with the same standing as France and Sweden.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=152\u2013155}} In 1780, Catherine II called for the invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the creation of a [[Greek Plan|new Greek Empire]] or restored Eastern Roman Empire, for which purposes an alliance was made between [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]'s Holy Roman Empire and Catherine II's Russian Empire.{{sfn|Beales|1987|pp=432}} The alliance between Joseph and Catherine was, at the time, heralded as a great success for both parties.{{sfn|Beales|1987|p=285}} Neither the Greek Plan or the [[Austro-Russian alliance (1781)|Austro-Russian alliance]] would persist long. Nonetheless, both empires would be part of the anti-Napoleonic Coalitions as well as the [[Concert of Europe]]. The Holy Roman\u2013Russian dispute ended with the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806.\n{{Gallery |title=Roman [[Double-headed eagle|double headed eagle]] iconography across empires|align=center>\n|File:Palaeologoi eagle XV c Byzantine miniature.jpg|Late Byzantine coat of arms, [[Palaiologos|House of Palaiologos]] (1400s)\n|File:Banner of the Holy Roman Emperor with haloes (1400-1806).svg|Banner of the Holy Roman Empire, [[House of Habsburg]] (1400\u20131806)\n|File:COA by Ivan IV of Russia 1577.png|Coat of arms of [[Ivan the Terrible]], [[Rurik dynasty|House of Rurik]] (1577)\n|File:Gerb rossii2.svg|Coat of arms of the Russian Empire, [[House of Romanov]] (1882)\n|File:Imperial Coat of Arms of the Empire of Austria (1815).svg|Coat of arms of the [[Austrian Empire]], House of Habsburg (1815) \n}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Legacy of the Roman Empire]] \u2013 for a general overview of the Roman Empire's legacy.\n* [[Third Rome]] \u2013 for various claims to being the successor of the Roman or Byzantine Empires.\n*[[Greek East and Latin West]] \u2013 for the division of the Mediterranean into distinct western and eastern linguistic and cultural spheres, dating to the time of the Roman Empire.\n*[[East\u2013West Schism]] \u2013 for the division between Roman and Constantinopolitan patriarchal [[Episcopal see|sees]] of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Church]].\n*[[Caesaropapism]] \u2013 historiographical term for the extensive powers of the Byzantine Emperor in ecclesiastical affairs.\n*[[Investiture Controversy]] \u2013 struggle between the Holy Roman Empire and Papacy for power over ecclesiastical appointments.\n*[[Donation of Constantine]] \u2013  for the Papacy's claim to Roman imperial powers over secular affairs and to primacy over the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Byzantine See]].\n*[[Antipope]] \u2013 for rival claimants to the [[Holy See|Roman See]], including candidates supported by Byzantine and Holy Roman emperors.\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n{{sfn whitelist|CITEREFBrand1968|CITEREFFine1994|CITEREFGeanakoplos1959|CITEREFVan_Tricht2011}}<!-- suppress false-positive sfn / harv 'no target' error messages -->\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |first=Derek |last=Beales |title=Joseph II: Volume 1, In the Shadow of Maria Theresa, 1741-1780 |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1987}}\n*{{Byzantium Confronts the West}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qAlcKDsubMgC |title=The Byzantine Empire |edition=Revised |last=Browning |first=Robert |publisher=CUA Press |year=1992 |isbn=978-0813207544 |ref=CITEREFBrowning1992}}\n*{{The Late Medieval Balkans}}\n*{{Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OgGUAgAAQBAJ&dq=%22problem+of+two+emperors%22 |title=Medieval German Literature: A Companion |last=Gibbs |first=Marion |last2=Johnson |first2=Sidney |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=0415928966 |ref=CITEREFGibbsJohnson2002}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=O5JqH_NXQBsC&dq=%22problem+of+two+emperors%22 |title=Byzantium: The Imperial Centuries, AD 610-1071 |last=Jenkins |first=Romilly James Heald |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |year=1987 |isbn=9780802066671 |ref=CITEREFJenkins1987}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=km_sCgAAQBAJ&dq=%22divisio+imperii%22 |title=Greece Reinvented: Transformations of Byzantine Hellenism in Renaissance Italy |last=Lamers |first=Han |publisher=Brill |year=2015 |isbn=978-9004297555 |ref=CITEREFLamers2015}}\n*{{Cite book |title=The Crusade of Frederick Barbarossa: The History of the Expedition of the Emperor Frederick and Related Texts |last=Loud |first=Graham |publisher=Ashgate |year=2010 |isbn=9780754665755 |ref=CITEREFLoud2010}}\n*{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oXqJDAAAQBAJ&dq=basil+I+louis+II+emperor |title=Empire and Order: The Concept of Empire, 800\u20131800 |last=Muldoon |first=James |publisher=Springer |year=1999 |isbn=978-0312222260 |ref=CITEREFMuldoon1999}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Nelsen|first=Brent F.|last2=Guth|first2=James L.|date=2003|title=Roman Catholicism and the Founding of Europe: How Catholics Shaped the European Communities|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229009870_Roman_Catholicism_and_the_Founding_of_Europe_How_Catholics_Shaped_the_European_Communities|journal=|publisher=The American Political Science Association|volume=|pages=|ref=CITEREFNelsenGuth2003|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal |last=Nicol |first=Donald M. |date=1967 |title=The Byzantine View of Western Europe |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/7bea5844cd4b6c248d45b1bab79f461b/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=1819401 |journal=Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=315\u2013339 |ref=CITEREFNicol1967}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ohnsorge |first=Werner |title=Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

Borders follow the political situation in 1190 AD.]]\nThe '''problem of two emperors''' or '''two-emperors-problem''' (deriving from the [[German language|German]] term '''Zweikaiserproblem'''<ref>The term was introduced in the first major treatise on the issue, by W. Ohnsorge, cf. {{harvnb|Ohnsorge|1947}}.</ref>) is the [[historiographical]] term for the historical contradiction between the idea of the [[universal monarchy|universal]] [[empire]], that there was only ever one true [[emperor]] at any one given time, and the truth that there were often two (or sometimes more) individuals who claimed the position simultaneously. The term is mostly used in regards to [[medieval Europe]], in particular, the long-lasting dispute between the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperors]] in [[Constantinople]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperors]] in modern-day Germany and Austria as to which emperor represented the legitimate [[Roman emperor]].\n\nIn the view of medieval Christians, the [[Roman Empire]] was indivisible and its emperor held a somewhat [[hegemony|hegemonic]] position even over Christians who did not live within the formal borders of the empire. Since the collapse of the classical Roman Empire during [[Late antiquity]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] (which represented its surviving provinces in the East) had been recognized by itself, the [[Pope]] and the various new Christian kingdoms throughout Europe as the legitimate Roman Empire. This changed in 797 when Emperor [[Constantine VI]] was deposed and replaced as ruler by his mother, Empress [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], who was not accepted in the West on account of being a woman. Rather than recognizing Irene, [[Pope Leo III]] proclaimed the [[King of the Franks]], [[Charlemagne]], as the Emperor of the Romans in 800 under the concept of ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (transfer of empire).\n\nAlthough the two empires eventually relented and recognized each other's rulers as emperors, they never explicitly recognized the other as \"Roman\", with the Byzantines referring to the Holy Roman emperor as the ''Emperor'' (or ''King'') ''of the Franks'' and later as the ''King of Germany'' and the western sources often describing the Byzantine emperor as the ''Emperor of the Greeks'' or the ''Emperor of Constantinople''. Over the course of the centuries after Charlemagne's coronation, the dispute in regards to the imperial title would be one of the most contested issues in Holy Roman\u2013Byzantine politics and though military action rarely resulted because of it, the dispute significantly soured diplomacy between the two empires. This lack of war was probably mostly on account of the geographical distance between the two empires. On occasion, the imperial title would be claimed by neighbors of the Byzantine Empire, such as [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], which often led to military confrontations.\n\nAfter the Byzantine Empire was momentarily overthrown by the Catholic [[Crusades|crusaders]] of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204 and supplanted by the [[Latin Empire]], the dispute continued even though both emperors now followed the same religious head for the first time since the dispute began. Though the Latin emperors recognized the Holy Roman emperors as the legitimate Roman emperors, they also claimed the title for themselves, which was not recognized by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in return. [[Pope Innocent III]] eventually accepted the idea of ''divisio imperii'' (division of empire), in which imperial hegemony would be divided into West (the Holy Roman Empire) and East (the Latin Empire). Although the Latin Empire would be destroyed by the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|resurgent Byzantine Empire]] under the [[Palaiologos dynasty]] in 1261, the Palaiologoi never reached the power of the pre-1204 Byzantine Empire and its emperors would ignore the problem of two emperors in favor of closer diplomatic ties with the west due to a need for aid against the many enemies of their empire.\n\nThe problem of two emperors only fully resurfaced after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, after which the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] claimed the imperial dignity as ''Kayser-i R\u00fbm'' (Caesar of the Roman Empire) and aspired to claim universal hegemony. The Ottomans called the Holy Roman emperors by the title ''k\u0131ral'' (king) for one and a half-century, until the Ottoman sultans formally recognized the Holy Roman emperors as emperors in the [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] in 1606, an acceptance of ''divisio imperii'', bringing an end to the dispute between Constantinople and Western Europe. After Constantinople's fall the [[Tsardom of Russia]] and the later [[Russian Empire]] would also claim the legacy of the Byzantine Empire, with its rulers titling themselves as ''[[Tsar]]'' (deriving from \"Caesar\") and later ''Imperator''. Their claim to the imperial title would be rejected by the Holy Roman emperors until 1726, when Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] recognized it as part of brokering an alliance, though he refused to admit that the two monarchs held equal status.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Political background ===\n[[File:Iren_and_Constantin2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Byzantine rulers [[Constantine VI]] and [[Irene of Athens]] at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787).]]\nFollowing the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century, Roman civilization endured in the remaining eastern half of the [[Roman Empire]], often termed by historians as the [[Byzantine Empire]] (though it self-identified simply as the \"Roman Empire\"). As the [[Roman emperors]] had done in antiquity, the [[Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine emperors]] saw themselves as universal rulers. The idea was that the world contained one empire (the Roman Empire) and one church and this idea survived despite the collapse of the empire's western provinces. Although the last extensive attempt at putting the theory back into practice had been [[Justinian I]]'s wars of reconquest in the 6th century, which saw the return of Italy and Africa into imperial control, the idea of a great western reconquest remained a dream for Byzantine emperors for centuries.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}}\n\nBecause the empire was constantly threatened at critical frontiers to its north and east, the Byzantines were unable to focus much attention to the west and Roman control would slowly disappear in the west once more. Nevertheless, their claim to the universal empire was acknowledged by temporal and religious authorities in the west, even if this empire couldn't be physically restored. [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gothic]] and [[Francia|Frankish]] kings in the fifth and sixth centuries acknowledged the emperor's suzerainty, as a symbolic acknowledgement of membership in the Roman Empire also enhanced their own status and granted them a position in the perceived world order of the time. As such, Byzantine emperors could still perceive the west as the western part of ''their'' empire, momentarily in barbarian hands, but still formally under their control through a system of recognition and honors bestowed on the western kings by the emperor.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}}\n\nA decisive geopolitical turning point in the relations between East and West was during the long reign of emperor [[Constantine V]] (741\u2013775). Though Constantine V conducted several successful military campaigns against the enemies of his empire, his efforts were centered on the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Muslims]] and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]], who represented immediate threats. Because of this, the defense of Italy was neglected. The main Byzantine administrative unit in Italy, the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], fell to the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Lombards]] in 751, ending the Byzantine presence in northern Italy.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=57}}\n\nThe collapse of the Exarchate had long-standing consequences. The [[popes]], ostensibly [[Byzantine Papacy|Byzantine vassals]], realized that Byzantine support was no longer a guarantee and increasingly began relying on the major kingdom in the West, the Frankish Kingdom, for support against the Lombards. Byzantine possessions throughout Italy, such as [[Venice]] and [[Naples]], began to raise their own militias and effectively became independent. Imperial authority ceased to be exercised in [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] and religious authority in southern Italy was formally transferred by the emperors from the popes to the [[patriarchs of Constantinople]]. The Mediterranean world, interconnected since the days of Roman Empire of old, had been definitely divided into East and West.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=58}}\n\nIn 797 the young emperor [[Constantine VI]] was arrested, deposed and blinded by his mother and former regent, [[Irene of Athens]]. She then governed the empire as its sole ruler, taking the title ''[[Basileus]]'' rather than the feminine form ''Basilissa'' (used for the empresses who were wives of reigning emperors). At the same time, the political situation in the West was rapidly changing. The Frankish Kingdom had been reorganized and revitalized under king [[Charlemagne]] and [[Pope Leo III]] had refused to recognize Irene as empress, viewing the idea of a woman emperor as an abomination and seeing the position of Roman emperor as vacant. When Charlemagne visited Rome for Christmas in 800 he was treated not as one territorial ruler among others, but as the sole legitimate monarch in Europe and on Christmas Day he was proclaimed and crowned by the Pope Leo III as the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]].{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=60}}\n\n=== Rome and the idea of the Universal Empire ===\n{{Main|Universal monarchy}}\n[[File:Friedrich Kaulbach - Kr\u00f6nung Karls des Gro\u00dfen.jpg|left|thumb|Imperial Coronation of [[Charlemagne]], by [[Friedrich Kaulbach]], 1861]]\nMost of the great empires in history were in one way or another [[Universal monarchy|universal monarchies]], they recognized no other state or empire as equal to them and claimed that the entire world (and all the people in it), or even the entire universe, was theirs to rule by right. Since no empire ever ruled the entire known world, unconquered and unincorporated people were usually treated as either unworthy of further attention since they were [[Barbarian|barbarians]], or they were looked over entirely through imperial ceremonies and ideology disguising reality. The allure of universal empires is the idea of universal peace; if all of humanity is united under one empire, war is theoretically impossible. Though the Roman Empire is an example of a \"universal empire\" in this sense, the idea is not exclusive to the Romans, having been expressed in unrelated entities such as the [[Aztec Empire]] and in earlier realms such as the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empires]].{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=4|2003}}\n\nMost \"universal emperors\" justified their ideology and actions through the divine; proclaiming themselves (or being proclaimed by others) as either divine themselves of as appointed on the behalf of the divine, meaning that their rule was theoretically [[Divine right of kings|sanctioned by heaven]]. By tying together religion with the empire and its ruler, obedience to the empire became the same thing as obedience to the divine. Like its predecessors, the [[Ancient Roman religion]] functioned in much the same way, conquerered peoples were expected to participate in the [[Imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]] regardless of their faith before Roman conquest. This imperial cult was threatened by religions such as Christianity (where Jesus Christ is explicitly proclaimed as the \"Lord\"), which is one of the primary reasons for the harsh persecutions of Christians during the early centuries of the Roman Empire; the religion was a direct threat to the ideology of the regime. Although Christianity eventually became the state religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, the imperial ideology was far from unrecognizable after its adoption. Like the previous imperial cult, Christianity now held the empire together and though the emperors were no longer recognized as gods, the emperors had successfully established themselves as the rulers of the Christian church in the place of Christ, still uniting temporal and spiritual authority.{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=4|2003}}\n\nIn the Byzantine Empire, the authority of the emperor as both the rightful temporal ruler of the Roman Empire and the head of Christianity remained unquestioned until the fall of the empire in the 15th century.{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=5|2003}} The Byzantines firmly believed that their emperor was God's appointed ruler and his viceroy on Earth (illustrated in their title as ''Deo coronatus'', \"crowned by God\"), that he was the Roman emperor (''basileus ton Rhomaion''), and as such the highest authority in the world due to his universal and exclusive emperorship. The emperor was an absolute ruler dependent on no one when exercising his power (illustrated in their title as ''[[autokrator]]'', or the Latin ''moderator'').{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=73}} The Emperor was adorned with an aura of holiness and was theoretically not accountable to anyone but God himself. The Emperor's power, as God's viceroy on Earth, was also theoretically unlimited. In essence, Byzantine imperial ideology was simply a christianization of the old Roman imperial ideology, which had also been universal and absolutist.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=74}}\n\nAs the Western Roman Empire collapsed and subsequent Byzantine attempts to retain the west crumbled, the church took the place of the empire in the west and by the time Western Europe emerged from the chaos endured during the 5th to 7th centuries, the Pope was the chief religious authority and the Franks were the chief temporal authority. Charlemagne's coronation as Roman emperor expressed an idea different from the absolutist ideas of the emperors in the Byzantine Empire. Though the eastern emperor retained control of both the temporal empire and the spiritual church, the rise of a new empire in the west was a collaborative effort, Charlemagne's temporal power had been won through his wars, but he had received the imperial crown from the Pope. Both the emperor and the Pope had claims to ultimate authority in Western Europe (the Popes as the successors of [[Saint Peter]] and the emperors as divinely appointed protectors of the church) and though their recognized the authority of each other, their \"dual rule\" would give rise to many controversies (such as the [[Investiture Controversy]] and the rise and fall of several [[Antipope|Antipopes]]).{{Sfn|Nelsen|Guth|p=5|2003}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Byzantine dispute ==\n\n=== Carolingian period ===\n\n==== Imperial ideology ====\n[[File:Carolingian and Byzantine Empires 814.png|thumb|The [[Carolingian Empire]] (yellow) and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (purple) in 814 AD.]]\n[[File:Charlemagne_denier_Mayence_812_814.jpg|alt=|thumb|Denarius of [[Francia|Frankish king]] [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned as Roman Emperor ''Karolus Imperator Augustus'' in the year 800 by [[Pope Leo III]] due to, and in opposition to, the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire in the East]] being ruled by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]], a woman. His coronation was strongly opposed by the Eastern Empire.]]\nThough the inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire itself never stopped referring to themselves as \"Romans\" (''[[Rhomaioi]]''), sources from Western Europe from the coronation of Charlemagne and onwards would deny the Roman legacy of the eastern empire by referring to its inhabitants as \"Greeks\". The idea behind this renaming was that Charlemagne's coronation did not represent a division (''divisio imperii'') of the Roman Empire into West and East nor a restoration (''[[renovatio imperii]]'') of the old Western Roman Empire. Rather, Charlemagne's coronation was the transfer (''[[translatio imperii]]'') of the ''imperium Romanum'' from the Greeks in the east to the Franks in the west.{{Sfn|Lamers|2015|p=65}} To contemporaries in Western Europe, Charlemagne's key legitimizing factor as emperor (other than papal approval) was the territories which he controlled. As he controlled formerly Roman lands in Gaul, Germany and Italy (including Rome itself), and acted as a true emperor in these lands, which the eastern emperor was seen as having had abandoned, he thus deserved to be called an emperor.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nAlthough crowned as an explicit refusal of the eastern emperor's claim to universal rule, Charlemagne himself does not appear to have been interested in confrontation with the Byzantine Empire or its rulers.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} When Charlemagne was crowned by Pope Leo III, the title he was bestowed with was simply ''Imperator''.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} When he wrote to Constantinople in 813, Charlemagne titled himself as the \"Emperor and [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] and also King of the Franks and of the Lombards\", identifying the imperial title with his previous royal titles in regards to the Franks and Lombards, rather than to the Romans. As such, his imperial title could be seen as stemming from the fact that he was the king of more than one kingdom (equating the title of emperor with that of [[King of Kings|king of kings]]), rather than as an usurpation of Byzantine power.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nOn his coins, the name and title used by Charlemagne is ''Karolus Imperator Augustus'' and in his own documents he used ''Imperator Augustus Romanum gubernans Imperium'' (\"August Emperor, governing the Roman Empire\") and ''serenissimus Augustus a Deo coronatus, magnus pacificus Imperator Romanorum gubernans Imperium'' (\"most serene Augustus crowned by God, great peaceful emperor governing the empire of the Romans\").{{sfn|Velde|2002}} The identification as an \"emperor governing the Roman Empire\" rather than a \"Roman emperor\" could be seen as an attempt at avoiding the dispute and issue over who was the true emperor and attempting to keep the perceived unity of the empire intact.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}}\n\nIn response to the Frankish adoption of the imperial title, the Byzantine emperors (which had previously simply used \"Emperor\" as a title) adopted the full title of \"Emperor of the Romans\" to make their supremacy clear.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} To the Byzantines, Charlemagne's coronation was a rejection of their perceived order of the world and an act of usurpation. Although Emperor [[Michael I Rangabe|Michael I]] eventually relented and recognized Charlemagne as an emperor and a \"spiritual brother\" of the eastern emperor, Charlemagne was not recognized as the ''Roman'' emperor and his ''imperium'' was seen as limited to his actual domains (as such not universal) and not as something that would outlive him (with his successors being referred to as \"kings\" rather than emperors in Byzantine sources).{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=320}}\n\nFollowing Charlemagne's coronation, the two empires engaged in diplomacy with each other. The exact terms discussed are unknown and negotiations were slow but it seems that Charlemagne proposed in 802 that the two rulers would marry and unite their empires.{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=61}} As such, the empire could have \"reunited\" without arguments as to which ruler was the legitimate one.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} This plan failed however, as the message only arrived in Constantinople after Irene had been deposed and exiled by a new emperor, [[Nikephoros I]].{{Sfn|Browning|1992|p=61}}\n\n==== Louis II and Basil I ====\n[[File:Louis II of Italy.png|left|thumb|Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]]'s (pictured) 871 letter to [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Basil I]] showcased that the two emperors held significantly different ideas of what it meant to be Roman.]]\nOne of the primary resources in regards to the problem of two emperors in the Carolingian period is a letter by Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]]. Louis II was the fourth emperor of the [[Carolingian Empire]], though his domain was confined to northern Italy as the rest of the empire had fractured into several different kingdoms, though these still acknowledged Louis as the emperor. His letter was a reply to a provocative letter by Byzantine emperor [[Basil I the Macedonian]]. Though Basil's letter is lost, its contents can be ascertained from the known geopolitical situation at the time and Louis's reply and probably related to the ongoing co-operation between the two empires against the Muslims. The focal point of Basil's letter was his refusal to recognize Louis II as a Roman emperor.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nBasil appears to have based his refusal on two main points. First of all, the title of Roman emperor was not hereditary (the Byzantines still considered it to formally be a [[Roman Republic|republican]] office, although also tied intimately with religion) and second of all, it wasn't considered appropriate for someone of a ''gens'' (e.g. an ethnicity) to hold the title. The Franks, and other groups throughout Europe, were seen as different ''gentes'' but to Basil and the rest of the Byzantines, \"Roman\" wasn't a ''gens''. Romans were defined chiefly by their lack of a ''gens'' and as such, Louis wasn't Roman and thus not a Roman emperor. There was only one Roman emperor, Basil himself, and though Basil considered that Louis could be an Emperor of the Franks, he appears to have questioned this as well seeing as only the ruler of the Romans was to be titled ''basileus'' (emperor).{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nAs illustrated by Louis's letter, the western idea of ethnicity was different from the Byzantine idea; everyone belonged to some form of ethnicity. Louis considered the ''gens romana'' (Roman people) to be the people who lived in the city of Rome, which he saw as having been deserted by the Byzantine Empire. All ''gentes'' could be ruled by a ''basileus'' in Louis's mind and as he pointed out, the title (which had originally simply meant \"king\") had been applied to other rulers in the past (notably Persian rulers). Furthermore, Louis disagreed with the notion that someone of a ''gens'' could not become the Roman emperor. He considered the ''gentes'' of [[Hispania]] (the [[Theodosian dynasty]]), [[Isauria]] (the [[Isaurian dynasty]]) and [[Khazaria]] ([[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]]) as all having provided emperors, though the Byzantines themselves would have seen all of these as Romans and not as peoples of ''gentes''. The views expressed by the two emperors in regards to ethnicity are somewhat paradoxical; Basil defined the Roman Empire in ethnic terms (defining it as explicitly against ethnicity) despite not considering the Romans as an ethnicity and Louis did not define the Roman Empire in ethnic terms (defining it as an empire of God, the creator of all ethnicities) despite considering the Romans as an ethnic people.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\n[[File:Pope Sergius II Illustration.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]] had been crowned as emperor by [[Pope Sergius II]] (pictured). The support of the [[papacy]] was one of the key factors from which the [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]], and later [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman]], emperors derived their legitimacy.]]\nLouis also derived legitimacy from religion. He argued that as the Pope of Rome, who actually controlled the city, had rejected the religious leanings of the Byzantines as heretical and instead favored the Franks and because the Pope had also crowned him emperor, Louis was the legitimate Roman emperor. The idea was that it was God himself, acting through his vicar the Pope, who had granted the church, people and city of Rome to him to govern and protect.{{Sfn|West|2016}} Louis's letter details that if he wasn't the Emperor of the Romans then he could not be the Emperor of the Franks either, as it was the Roman people themselves who had accorded his ancestors with the imperial title. In contrast to the Papal affirmation of his imperial lineage, Louis chastized the eastern empire for its emperors mostly only being affirmed by their [[Byzantine Senate|senate]] and sometimes lacking even that, with some emperors having been proclaimed by the army, or worse, women (probably a reference to Irene). Louis probably overlooked that affirmation by the army was the original ancient source for the title of ''[[Imperator]]'', before it came to mean the ruler of the Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=48}}\n\nThough it would have been possible for either side of the dispute to concede to the obvious truth, that there were now two empires and two emperors, this would have denied the understood nature of what the empire was and meant (its unity).{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=47}} Although Louis's letter does offer some evidence that he might have recognized the political situation as such; Louis is referred to as the \"August Emperor of the Romans\" and Basil is referred to as the \"very glorious and pious emperor of New Rome\",{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=49}} and he suggests that the \"indivisible empire\" is the empire of God and that \"God has not granted this church to be steered either by me or you alone, but so that we should be bound to each other with such love that we cannot be divided, but should seem to exist as one\".{{Sfn|West|2016}} These references are more likely to mean that Louis still considered there to be a single empire, but with two imperial claimants (an emperor and an anti-emperor so to speak). Neither side in the dispute would have been willing to reject the idea of the single empire. His titling of the Byzantine emperor as an emperor in the letter may simply be a courtesy, rather than an implication that he truly accepted his imperial rule.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}}\n\nLouis's letter mentions that the Byzantines abandoned Rome, the seat of empire, and lost the Roman way of life and the Latin language. In his view, that the empire was ruled from Constantinople did not represent it surviving, but rather that it had fled from its responsibilities.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=49}} Although he would have had to approve its contents, Louis probably did not write his letter himself and it was probably instead written by the prominent cleric [[Anastasius the Librarian]]. Anastasius was not a Frank but a citizen of the city of Rome (in Louis's view an \"ethnic Roman\"). As such, prominent figures in Rome itself would have shared Louis's views, illustrating that by his time, the Byzantine Empire and the city of Rome had drifted very far apart.{{Sfn|West|2016}}\n\nFollowing the death of Louis in 875, emperors continued to be crowned in the West for a few decades, but their reigns were often brief and problematic and they only held limited power and as such the problem of two emperors ceased being a major issue to the Byzantines, for a time.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1987|p=285}}\n\n=== Ottonian period ===\n[[File:Nikiphoros Phokas.jpg|left|thumb|Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] (pictured) was outraged at the Papal coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] and vowed to reconquer Italy and force the Pope to submit to him.]]\nThe problem of two emperors returned when [[Pope John XII]] crowned the King of Germany, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], as Emperor of the Romans in 962, almost 40 years after the death of the previous papally crowned emperor, [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar]]. Otto's repeated territorial claims to all of Italy and Sicily (as he had also been proclaimed as the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]]) brought him into conflict with the Byzantine Empire.{{Sfn|Gibbs|Johnson|2002|p=62}} The Byzantine emperor at the time, [[Romanos II]], appears to have more or less ignored Otto's imperial aspirations, but the succeeding Byzantine emperor, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros II]], was strongly opposed to them. Otto, who hoped to secure imperial recognition and the provinces in southern Italy diplomatically through a marriage alliance, dispatched diplomatic envoys to Nikephoros in 967.{{Sfn|Jenkins|1987|p=285}} To the Byzantines, Otto's coronation was a blow as, or even more, serious than Charlemagne's as Otto and his successors insisted on the Roman aspect of their ''imperium'' more strongly than their Carolingian predecessors.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=321}}\n\nLeading Otto's diplomatic mission was [[Liutprand of Cremona]], who chastized the Byzantines for their perceived weakness; losing control of the West and thus also causing the Pope to lose control of the lands which belonged to him. To Liutprand, the fact that Otto I had acted as a restorer and protector of the church by restoring the [[Papal States|lands of the Papacy]] (which Liutprand believed had been granted to the Pope by Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]]), made him the true emperor while the loss of these lands under preceding Byzantine rule illustrated that the Byzantines were weak and unfit to be emperors.{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}} Liutprand expresses his ideas with the following words in [[wikisource:Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages/Appendix|his report]] on the mission, in a reply to Byzantine officials:{{Sfn|Halsall|1996}}{{Cquote\n| quote = My master did not by force or tyrannically invade the city of Rome; but he freed it from a tyrant, nay, from the yoke of tyrants. Did not the slaves of women rule over it; or, which is worse and more disgraceful, harlots themselves? Your power, I fancy, or that of your predecessors, who in name alone are called emperors of the Romans and are it not in reality, was sleeping at that time. If they were powerful, if emperors of the Romans, why did they permit Rome to be [[Saeculum obscurum|in the hands of harlots]]? Were not some of them most holy popes banished, others so oppressed that they were not able to have their daily supplies or the means of giving alms? Did not Adalbert send scornful letters to the emperors Romanus and [[Constantine VII|Constantine]] your predecessors? Did he not plunder the churches of the most holy apostles? What one of you emperors, led by zeal for God, took care to avenge so unworthy a crime and to bring back the holy church to its proper conditions You neglected it, my master did not neglect it. For, rising from the ends of the earth and coming to Rome, he removed the impious and gave back to the vicars of the holy apostles their power and all their honor...\n}}\nNikephoros pointed out to Liutprand personally that Otto was a mere barbarian king who had no right to call himself an emperor, nor to call himself a Roman.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=318}} Just before Liutprand's arrival in Constantinople, Nikephoros II had received an offensive letter from [[Pope John XIII]], possibly written under pressure from Otto, in which the Byzantine emperor was referred to as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\" and not the \"Emperor of the Romans\", denying his true imperial status. Liutprand recorded the outburst of Nikephoros's representatives at this letter, which illustrates that the Byzantines too had developed an idea similar to ''translatio imperii'' regarding the transfer of power from Rome to Constantinople:{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=50}}{{Cquote\n| quote = Hear then!

Otto leaving out any mention of Romans in his imperial title may be because he wanted to achieve the recognition of the Byzantine emperor. Following Otto's reign, mentions of the Romans in the imperial title became more common. In the 11th century, the German king (the title held by those who were later crowned emperors) was referred to as the ''Rex Romanorum'' (\"[[King of the Romans]]\") and in the century after that, the standard imperial title was ''dei gratia Romanorum Imperator semper Augustus'' (\"By the Grace of God, Emperor of the Romans, ever August\").{{sfn|Velde|2002}}\n\n=== Hohenstaufen period ===\nTo Liutprand of Cremona and later scholars in the west, the perceived weak and degenerate eastern emperors were not true emperors; there was a single empire under the true emperors (Otto I and his successors), who demonstrated their right to the empire through their restoration of the Church. In return, the eastern emperors did not recognize the imperial status of their challengers in the west. Although [[Michael I Rangabe|Michael I]] had referred to Charlemagne by the title ''Basileus'' in 812, he hadn't referred to him as the ''Roman'' emperor. ''Basileus'' in of itself was far from an equal title to that of Roman emperor. In their own documents, the only emperor recognized by the Byzantines was their own ruler, the Emperor of the Romans. In [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''[[The Alexiad]]'' ({{Circa|1148}}), the Emperor of the Romans is her father, [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], while the Holy Roman emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] is titled simply as the \"King of Germany\".{{Sfn|Muldoon|1999|p=51}}\n\nIn the 1150s, the Byzantine emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] became involved in a three-way struggle between himself, the Holy Roman emperor [[Frederick I Barbarossa]] and the [[Italo-Norman]] [[King of Sicily]], [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. Manuel aspired to lessen the influence of his two rivals and at the same time win the recognition of the Pope (and thus by extension Western Europe) as the sole legitimate emperor, which would unite Christendom under his sway. Manuel reached for this ambitious goal by financing a [[Lombard League|league of Lombard towns]] to rebel against Frederick and encouraging dissident Norman barons to do the same against the Sicilian king. Manuel even dispatched his army to southern Italy, the last time a Byzantine army ever set foot in Western Europe. Despite his efforts, Manuel's campaign ended in failure and he won little except the hatred of both Barbarossa and Roger, who by the time the campaign concluded had allied with each other.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=15}}\n\n==== Frederick Barbarossa's crusade ====\n{{See also|Third Crusade}}{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Friedrich I.

Isaac learnt that Barbarossa, a known foe of his empire, was to lead a large contingent in the footprints of the First and Second crusades through the Byzantine Empire. Isaac II interpreted Barbarossa's march through his empire as a threat and considered it inconceivable that Barbarossa did not also intend to overthrow the Byzantine Empire.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=176}} As a result of his fears, Isaac II imprisoned numerous Latin citizens in Constantinople.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}} In his treaties and negotiations with Barbarossa (which exist preserved as written documents), Isaac II was insincere as he had secretly allied with Saladin to gain concessions in the Holy Land and had agreed to delay and destroy the German army.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}}\n\nBarbarossa, who did not in fact intend to take Constantinople, was unaware of Isaac's alliance with Saladin but still wary of the rival emperor. As such he sent out an embassy in early 1189, headed by the Bishop of M\u00fcnster.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=177}} Isaac was absent at the time, putting down a revolt in [[Ala\u015fehir|Philadelphia]], and returned to Constantinople a week after the German embassy arrived, after which he immediately had the Germans imprisoned. This imprisonment was partly motivated by Isaac wanting to possess German hostages, but more importantly, an embassy from Saladin, probably noticed by the German ambassadors, was also in the capital at this time.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=178}}\n\nOn 28 June 1189, Barbarossa's crusade reached the Byzantine borders, the first time a Holy Roman emperor personally set foot within the borders of the Byzantine Empire. Although Barbarossa's army was received by the closest major governor, the governor of Branitchevo, the governor had received orders to stall or, if possible, destroy the German army. On his way to the city of [[Ni\u0161]], Barbarossa was repeatedly assaulted by locals under the orders of the governor of Branitchevo and Isaac II also engaged in a campaign of closing roads and destroying foragers.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=178}} The attacks against Barbarossa amounted to little and only resulted in around a hundred losses. A more serious issue was a lack of supplies, since the Byzantines refused to provide markets for the German army. The lack of markets was excused by Isaac as due to not having received advance notice of Barbarossa's arrival, a claim rejected by Barbarossa, who saw the embassy he had sent earlier as notice enough. Despite these issues, Barbarossa still apparently believed that Isaac was not hostile against him and refused invitations from the enemies of the Byzantines to join an alliance against them. While at Ni\u0161 he was assured by Byzantine ambassadors that though there was a significant Byzantine army assembled near Sofia, it had been assembled to fight the Serbs and not the Germans. This was a lie, and when the Germans reached the position of this army, they were treated with hostility, though the Byzantines fled at the first charge of the German cavalry.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=179}}\n\n[[File:The Third Crusade (1189-1192).png|left|thumb|Path of the [[Third Crusade]] (1189\u20131192), Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]]'s path in red.]]\nIsaac II panicked and issued contradictory orders to the governor of the city of [[Philippopolis (Thrace)|Philippopolis]], one of the strongest fortresses in [[Thrace]]. Fearing that the Germans were to use the city as a base of operations, its governor, [[Niketas Choniates]] (later a major historian of these events), was first ordered to strengthen the city's walls and hold the fortress at all costs, but later to abandon the city and destroy its fortifications. Isaac II seems to have been unsure of how to deal with Barbarossa. Barbarossa meanwhile wrote to the main Byzantine commander, [[Manuel Kamytzes]], that \"resistance was in vain\", but also made clear that he had absolutely no intention to harm the Byzantine Empire. On 21 August, a letter from Isaac II reached Barbarossa, who was encamped outside Philippopolis. In the letter, which caused great offense, Isaac II explicitly called himself the \"Emperor of the Romans\" in opposition to Barbarossa's title and the Germans also misinterpreted the Byzantine emperor as calling himself an angel (on account of his last name, Angelos). Furthermore, Isaac II demanded half of any territory to be conquered from the Muslims during the crusade and justified his actions by claiming that he had heard from the governor of Branitchevo that Barbarossa had plans to conquer the Byzantine Empire and place his son [[Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia|Frederick of Swabia]] on its throne. At the same time Barbarossa learnt of the imprisonment of his earlier embassy.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=180}} Several of Barbarossa's barons suggested that they take immediate military action against the Byzantines, but Barbarossa preferred a diplomatic solution.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=181}}\n\nIn the letters exchanged between Isaac II and Barbarossa, neither side titled the other in the way they considered to be appropriate. In his first letter, Isaac II referred to Barbarossa simply as the \"King of Germany\". The Byzantines eventually realized that the \"wrong\" title hardly improved the tense situation and in the second letter Barbarossa was called \"the most high-born Emperor of Germany\". Refusing to recognize Barbarossa as ''the'' Roman emperor, the Byzantines eventually relented with calling him \"the most noble emperor of Elder Rome\" (as opposed to the New Rome, Constantinople). The Germans always referred to Isaac II as the Greek emperor or the Emperor of Constantinople.{{Sfn|Loud|2010|p=79}}\n\n[[File:1191 - Fridrich Barbarossa.jpg|thumb|Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] depicted during the [[Third Crusade]].]]\nThe Byzantines continued to harass the Germans. The wine left behind in the abandoned city of Philippopolis had been poisoned, and a second embassy sent from the city to Constantinople by Barbarossa was also imprisoned, though shortly thereafter Isaac II relented and released both embassies. When the embassies reunited with Barbarossa at Philippopolis they told the Holy Roman emperor of Isaac II's alliance with Saladin, and claimed that the Byzantine emperor intended to destroy the German army while it was crossing the [[Bosporus]]. In retaliation for spotting anti-Crusader propaganda in the surrounding region, the crusaders devastated the immediate area around Philippopolis, slaughtering the locals. After Barbarossa was addressed as the \"King of Germany\", he flew into a fit of rage, demanding hostages from the Byzantines (including Isaac II's son and family), asserting that he was the one true Emperor of the Romans and made it clear that he intended to winter in Thrace despite the Byzantine emperor's offer of assisting the German army to cross the Bosporus.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=182}}\n\nBy this point, Barbarossa had become convinced that Constantinople needed to be conquered in order for the crusade to be successful. On 18 November he sent a letter to his son, Henry, in which he explained to difficulties he had encountered and ordered his son to prepare for an attack against Constantinople, ordering the assembling of a large fleet to meet him in the Bosporus once spring came. Furthermore, Henry was instructed to ensure Papal support for such a campaign, organizing a great Western crusade against the Byzantines as enemies of God. Isaac II replied to Barbarossa's threats by claiming that Thrace would be Barbarossa's \"deathtrap\" and that it was too late for the German emperor to escape \"his nets\". As Barbarossa's army, reinforced with Serbian and [[Vlach]] allies, approached Constantinople, Isaac II's resolve faded and he began to favor peace instead.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=184}} Barbarossa had continued to send offers of peace and reconciliation since he had seized Philippopolis, and once Barbarossa officially sent a declaration of war in late 1189, Isaac II at last relented, realizing he wouldn't be able to destroy the German army and was at risk of losing Constantinople itself. The peace saw the Germans being allowed to pass freely through the empire, transportation across the Bosporus and the opening of markets as well as compensation for the damage done to Barbarossa's expedition by the Byzantines.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=185}} Frederick then continued on towards the Holy Land without any further major incidents with the Byzantines, with the exception of the German army almost sacking the city of Philadelphia after its governor refused to open up the markets to the Crusaders.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=187}} The incidents during the Third Crusade heightened animosity between the Byzantine Empire and the west. To the Byzantines, the devastation of Thrace and efficiency of the German soldiers had illustrated the threat they represented, while in the West, the mistreatment of the emperor and the imprisonment of the embassies would be long remembered.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=188}}\n\n==== Threats of Henry VI ====\n[[File:Henry VI HRE suzerainty.png|right|thumb|Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] nearly succeeded in uniting Christianity under his own sway, ruling all of Germany and Italy as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]] and [[King of Sicily]], formally vassalizing the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]] and [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] and receiving recognitions of suzerainty by the kingdoms of [[Angevin Empire|England]], [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].

The Muslim world had fractured after Saladin's death and Barbarossa's crusade had revealed the Byzantine Empire to be weak and also given a useful ''casus belli'' for attack. Furthermore, [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo II]], the ruler of [[Cilician Armenia]], offered to swear fealty to Henry VI in exchange for being accorded a royal crown.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=189}} Henry bolstered his efforts against the eastern empire by marrying a captive daughter of Isaac II, [[Irene Angelina]], to his brother [[Philip of Swabia]] in 1195, giving his brother a dynastic claim that could prove useful in the future.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=190}}\n\nIn 1195 Henry VI also dispatched an embassy to the Byzantine Empire, demanding from Isaac II that he transfer a stretch of land stretching from [[Durazzo]] to [[Thessalonica]], previously conquered by the Sicilian king William II, and also wished the Byzantine emperor to promise naval support in preparation for a new crusade. According to Byzantine historians, the German ambassadors spoke as if Henry VI was the \"emperor of emperors\" and \"lord of lords\". Henry VI intended to force the Byzantines to pay him to ensure peace, essentially extracting tribute, and his envoys put forward the grievances that the Byzantines had caused throughout Barbarossa's reign. Not in a position to resist, Isaac II succeeded to modify the terms so that they were purely monetary. Shortly after agreeing to these terms, Isaac II was overthrown and replaced as emperor by his older brother, [[Alexios III Angelos]].{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=191}}\n\nHenry VI successfully compelled Alexios III as well [[Alamanikon|to pay tribute to him]] under the threat of otherwise conquering Constantinople on his way to the Holy Land.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=192}} Henry VI had grand plans of becoming the leader of the entire Christian world. Although he would only directly rule his traditional domains, Germany and Italy, his plans were that no other empire would claim [[Ecumene|ecumenical]] power and that all Europe was to recognize his suzerainty. His attempt to subordinate the Byzantine Empire to himself was just one step in his partially successful plan of extending his feudal overlordship from his own domains to France, England, Aragon, Cilician Armenia, Cyprus and the Holy Land.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=193}} Based on the establishment of bases in the Levant and the submission of Cilician Armenia and Cyprus, it is possible that Henry VI really considered  invading and conquering the Byzantine Empire, thus uniting the rivalling empires under his rule. This plan, just as Henry's plan of making the position of emperor hereditary rather than elective, ultimately never transpired as he was kept busy by internal affairs in Sicily and Germany.{{Sfn|Brand|1968|p=194}}\n\nThe threat of Henry VI caused some concern in the Byzantine Empire and Alexios III slightly altered his imperial title to ''en Christoi to theo pistos basileus theostephes anax krataios huspelos augoustos kai autokrator Romaion'' in Greek and ''in Christo Deo fidelis imperator divinitus coronatus sublimis potens excelsus semper augustus moderator Romanorum'' in Latin. Though previous Byzantine emperors had used ''basileus kai autokrator Romaion'' (\"Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans\"), Alexios III's title separated ''basileus'' from the rest and replaced its position with ''augoustos'' (''Augustus'', the old Roman imperial title), creating the possible interpretation that Alexios III was simply ''an'' emperor (''Basileus'') and besides that also the ''moderator Romanorum'' (\"Autocrat of the Romans\") but not explicitly ''the'' Roman emperor, so that he was no longer in direct competition with his rival in Germany and that his title was less provocative to the West in general. Alexios III's successor, Alexios IV Angelos, continued with this practice and went even further, inverting the order of ''moderator Romanorum'' and rendering it as ''Romanorum moderator''.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=64}}\n\n==== The Latin Empire ====\n[[File:Fourth Crusade and foundation of the Latin Empire.png|thumb|The path of the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) and the political situation within the borders of the former [[Byzantine Empire]] after its victory.]]\nA series of unfortunate events and the intervention of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] led to the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1202\u20131204) [[Sack of Constantinople|sacking Constantinople]] instead of attacking its intended target, Egypt. When the crusaders seized Constantinople in 1204, they founded the [[Latin Empire]] and called their new realm the ''imperium Constantinopolitanum'', the same term used for the Byzantine Empire in Papal correspondence. This suggests that, although they had placed a new Catholic emperor, [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], on the throne of Constantinople and changed the administrative structure of the empire into a feudal network of counties, duchies and kingdoms, the crusaders viewed themselves as taking over the Byzantine Empire rather than replacing it with a new entity.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=61}} Notably Baldwin I was designated as an emperor, not a king. This is despite the fact that the crusaders, as Western Christians, would have recognized the Holy Roman Empire as the true Roman Empire and its ruler as the sole true emperor and that founding treaties of the Latin Empire explicitly designate the empire as in the service of the Roman Catholic Church.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=62}}\n\n[[File:Imperial_seal_of_Balwin_I.png|alt=|thumb|Seal of [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], the first [[Latin Emperor]]. The abbreviation ''Rom.'' conveniently leaves it open to interpretation if he refers to ''Romaniae'' (\"Romania\") or ''Romanorum'' (\"the Romans\").]]\nThe rulers of the Latin Empire, although they seem to have called themselves Emperors of Constantinople (''imperator Constantinopolitanus'') or Emperors of Romania (''imperator Romaniae'', Romania being a Byzantine term meaning the \"land of the Romans\") in correspondence with the Papacy, used the same imperial titles within their own empire as their direct Byzantine predecessors, with the titles of the Latin Emperors (''Dei gratia fidelissimus in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus'') being near identical to the Latin version of the title of Byzantine emperor Alexios IV (''fidelis in Christo imperator a Deo coronatus Romanorum moderator et semper augustus'').{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=63}} As such, the titles of the Latin emperors continued the compromise in titulature worked out by Alexios III.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=64}} In his seals, Baldwin I abbreviated ''Romanorum'' as ''Rom''., a convenient and slight adjustment that left it open to interpretation if it truly referred to ''Romanorum'' or if it meant ''Romaniae''.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=63}}\n\nThe Latin Emperors saw the term ''Romanorum'' or ''Romani'' in a new light, not seeing it as referring to the Western idea of \"geographic Romans\" (inhabitants of the city of Rome) but not adopting the Byzantine idea of the \"ethnic Romans\" (Greek-speaking citizens of the Byzantine Empire) either. Instead, they saw the term as a political identity encapsulating all subjects of the Roman emperor, i.e. all the subjects of their multi-national empire (whose ethnicities encompassed Latins, \"Greeks\", Armenians and Bulgarians).{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=75}}\n\nThe embracing of the Roman nature of the emperorship in Constantinople would have brought the Latin emperors into conflict with the idea of ''translatio imperii''. Furthermore, the Latin emperors claimed the dignity of ''Deo coronatus'' (as the Byzantine emperors had claimed before them), a dignity the Holy Roman emperors could not claim, being dependent on the Pope for their coronation. Despite the fact that the Latin emperors would have recognized the Holy Roman Empire as ''the'' Roman Empire, they nonetheless claimed a position that was at least equal to that of the Holy Roman emperors.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=76}} In 1207\u20131208, Latin emperor [[Henry of Flanders|Henry]] proposed to marry the daughter of the elected ''rex Romanorum'' in the Holy Roman Empire, Henry VI's brother Philip of Swabia, yet to be crowned emperor due to an ongoing struggle with the rival claimant [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]]. Philip's envoys responded that Henry was an ''advena'' (stranger; outsider) and ''solo nomine imperator'' (emperor in name only) and that the marriage proposal would only be accepted if Henry recognized Philip as the ''imperator Romanorum'' and ''suus dominus'' (his master). As no marriage occurred, it is clear that submission to the Holy Roman emperor was not considered an option.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=77}}\n\nThe emergence of the Latin Empire and the submission of Constantinople to the Catholic Church as facilitated by its emperors altered the idea of ''translatio imperii'' into what was called ''divisio imperii'' (division of empire). The idea, which became accepted by [[Pope Innocent III]], saw the formal recognition of Constantinople as an imperial seat of power and its rulers as legitimate emperors, which could rule in tandem with the already recognized emperors in the West. The idea resulted in that the Latin emperors never attempted to enforce any religious or political authority in the West, but attempted to enforce a hegemonic religious and political position, similar to that held by the Holy Roman emperors in the West, over the lands in Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean, especially in regards to the [[Crusader states]] in the [[Levant]], where the Latin emperors would oppose the local claims of the Holy Roman emperors.{{Sfn|Van Tricht|2011|p=77}}\n\n=== Restoration of the Byzantine Empire ===\n[[File:Michael VIII Palaiologos (head).jpg|left|thumb|Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured [[Constantinople]] from the [[Latin Empire]] in 1261. Michael and [[Palaiologos|his dynasty]] would pursue a policy of reconciliation with the west, much to the dismay of their subjects.]]\nWith the Byzantine [[reconquest of Constantinople]] in 1261 under Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the Papacy suffered a loss of prestige and endured severe damage to its spiritual authority. Once more, the easterners had asserted their right not only to the position of Roman emperor but also to a church independent of the one centered in Rome. The popes who were active during Michael's reign all pursued a policy of attempting to assert their religious authority over the Byzantine Empire. As Michael was aware that the popes held considerable sway in the west (and wishing to avoid a repeat of the events of 1204), he dispatched an embassy to [[Pope Urban IV]] immediately after taking possession of the city. The two envoys were immediately imprisoned once they sat foot in Italy: one was flayed alive and the other managed to escape back to Constantinople.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=140f}} From 1266 to his death in 1282, Michael would repeatedly be threatened by the King of Sicily, [[Charles I of Anjou|Charles of Anjou]], who aspired to restore the Latin Empire and periodically enjoyed Papal support.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=189f}}\n\nMichael VIII and his successors, the [[Palaiologan dynasty]], aspired to reunite the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] with the Church of Rome, chiefly because Michael recognized that only the Pope could constrain Charles of Anjou. To this end, Byzantine envoys were present at the [[Second Council of Lyons]] in 1274, where the Church of Constantinople was formally reunified with Rome, restoring communion after more than two centuries.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=258\u2013264}} On his return to Constantinople, Michael was taunted with the words \"you have become a [[Franks#Legacy|Frank]]\", which remains a term in Greek to taunt converts to Catholicism to this day.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=338}} The Union of the Churches aroused passionate opposition from the Byzantine people, the Orthodox clergy, and even within the imperial family itself. Michael's sister [[Irene Komnene Palaiologina|Eulogia]], and her daughter Anna, wife of the ruler of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] [[Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas]], were among the chief leaders of the anti-Unionists. Nikephoros, his half-brother [[John I Doukas of Thessaly]], and even the [[Emperor of Trebizond]], [[John II of Trebizond|John II Megas Komnenos]], soon joined the anti-Unionist cause and gave support to the anti-Unionists fleeing Constantinople.{{sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=264\u2013275}}\n\nNevertheless, the Union achieved Michael's main aim: it legitimized Michael and his successors as rulers of Constantinople in the eyes of the west. Furthermore, Michael's idea of a crusade to recover the lost portions of Anatolia received positive reception at the council, though such a campaign would never materialize.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|pp=286\u2013290}} The union was disrupted in 1281 when Michael was excommunicated, possibly due to [[Pope Martin IV]] having been pressured by Charles of Anjou.{{Sfn|Geanakoplos|1959|p=341}} Following Michael's death, and with the threat of an Angevin invasion having subsided following the [[Sicilian Vespers]], his successor, [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]], was quick to repudiate the hated Union of the Churches.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=194}} Although popes after Michael's death would periodically consider a new crusade against Constantinople to once more impose Catholic rule, no such plans materialized.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=332}}\n\nAlthough Michael VIII, unlike his predecessors, did not protest when addressed as the \"Emperor of the Greeks\" by the popes in letters and at the Council of Lyons, his conception of his universal emperorship remained unaffected.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=319}} As late as 1395, when Constantinople was more or less surrounded by the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|rapidly expanding]] [[Ottoman Empire]] and it was apparent that its fall was a matter of time, Patriarch [[Antony IV of Constantinople]] still referenced the idea of the universal empire in a letter to the [[Grand Prince of Moscow]], [[Vasily I of Moscow|Vasily I]], stating that anyone other than the Byzantine emperor assuming the title of \"emperor\" was \"illegal\" and \"unnatural\".{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=316}}\n\nFaced with the Ottoman danger, Michael's successors, prominently [[John V Palaiologos|John V]] and [[Manuel II Palaiologos|Manuel II]], periodically attempted to restore the Union, much to the dismay of their subjects. At the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439, Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]] reaffirmed the Union in the light of imminent Turkish attacks on what little remained of his empire. To the Byzantine citizens themselves, the Union of the Churches, which had assured the promise of a great western crusade against the Ottomans, was a death warrant for their empire. John VIII had betrayed their faith and as such their entire imperial ideology and world view. The promised [[Crusade of Varna|crusade]], the fruit of John VIII's labor, ended only in disaster as it was defeated by the Turks at the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=333}}\n\n== Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian dispute ==\n[[File:Skylitzes - Sime\u00f3n el Grande crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] (and some of his successors) would challenge the [[Byzantine Empire]] for the universal emperorship, adopting the title \"Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans\" in 913.]]\nThe dispute between the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire was mostly confined to the realm of diplomacy, never fully exploding into open war. This was probably mainly due to the great geographical distance separating the two empires; a large-scale campaign would have been infeasible to undertake for either emperor.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=325}} Events in Germany, France and the west in general was of little compelling interest to the Byzantines as they firmly believed that the western provinces would eventually be reconquered.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}} Of more compelling interest were political developments in their near vicinity and in 913, the ''Knyaz'' (prince or king) of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]], arrived at the walls of Constantinople with an army. Simeon I's demands were not only that Bulgaria would be recognized as independent from the Byzantine Empire, but that it was to be designated as a new universal empire, absorbing and replacing the universal empire of Constantinople. Because of the threat represented, the Patriarch of Constantinople, [[Nicholas Mystikos]], granted an imperial crown to Simeon. Simeon was designated as the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'', not ''of the Romans'' and as such, the diplomatic gesture had been somewhat dishonest.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=325}}\n\nThe Byzantines soon discovered that Simeon was in fact titling himself as not only the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'', but as the ''Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans''. The problem was solved when Simeon died in 927 and his son and successor, Peter I, simply adopted ''Emperor of the Bulgarians'' as a show of submission to the universal empire of Constantinople. The problem, deriving from Simeon's claim, would on occasion be revived by strong Bulgarian monarchs who once more adopted the title of ''Emperor of the Bulgarians and the Romans'', such as [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] ({{Reign}}1196\u20131207) and [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] ({{Reign}}1218\u20131241).{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}} Kaloyan attempted to receive recognition by [[Pope Innocent III]] as emperor, but Innocent refused, instead offering to provide a [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] to crown him simply as king.{{sfn|Sweeney|1973|pp=322\u2013324}} Simeon's claim was also momentarily revived by the rulers of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]] in 1346 with [[Stefan Du\u0161an]]'s coronation as ''Emperor of the Serbs and Romans''.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=326}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Ottoman dispute ==\n[[File:Gennadios_II_and_Mehmed_II.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] (left, depicted with Patriarch [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]] to his right) claimed the legacy of the [[Byzantine Empire]] upon his [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453.

Mehmed deliberately linked himself to the Byzantine imperial tradition, making few changes in Constantinople itself and working on restoring the city through repairs and (sometimes forced) immigration, which soon led to an economic upswing. Mehmed also appointed a new Greek Orthodox Patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]], and began minting his own coins (a practice which the Byzantine emperors had engaged in, but the Ottomans never had previously). Furthermore, Mehmed introduced stricter court ceremonies and protocols inspired by those of the Byzantines.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}}\n\nContemporaries within the Ottoman Empire recognized Mehmed's assumption of the imperial title and his claim to world domination. The historian [[Michael Critobulus]] described the sultan as \"Emperor of Emperors\", \"autocrat\" and \"Lord of the Earth and the sea according to God's will\". In a letter to the [[Doge of Venice]], Mehmed was described by his courtiers as the \"Emperor\". Other titles were sometimes used as well, such as \"Grand Duke\" and \"Prince of the Turkish Romans\".{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} The citizens of Constantinople and the former Byzantine Empire (which would still identify as \"Romans\" and not \"Greeks\" until modern times) saw the Ottoman Empire as still representing their empire, the universal empire; the imperial capital was still Constantinople and its ruler, Mehmed II, was the ''basileus''.{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=334}}\n[[File:Wien-khm-kunstkammer-francis1-0.jpg|left|thumb|Marble bust of the final [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], in a style inspired by ancient Roman marble busts.]]\nAs with the Byzantine emperors before them, the imperial status of the Ottoman sultans was primarily expressed through the refusal to recognize the Holy Roman emperors as equal rulers. In diplomacy, the western emperors were titled as ''k\u0131ral'' (kings) of Vienna or Hungary.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} This practice had been cemented and reinforced by the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1533)|Treaty of Constantinople]] in 1533, signed by the Ottoman Empire (under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]) and the [[Archduchy of Austria]] (as represented by [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] on behalf of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], Holy Roman Emperor), wherein it was agreed that Ferdinand I was to be considered as the King of Germany and Charles V as the King of Spain. These titles were considered to be equal in rank to the Ottoman Empire's [[Grand vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]], subordinate to the imperial title held by the sultan. The treaty also banned its signatories to count anyone as an emperor except the Ottoman sultan.{{Sfn|Shaw|1976|p=94}}\n\nThe problem of two emperors and the dispute between the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire would be finally resolved after the two empires signed a peace treaty following a string of Ottoman defeats. In the 1606 [[Peace of Zsitvatorok]] Ottoman sultan [[Ahmed I]], for the first time in his empire's history, formally recognized the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] with the title ''[[Padishah]]'' (emperor) rather than ''k\u0131ral''. Ahmed made sure to write \"like a father to a son\", symbolically emphasizing that the eastern empire retained some primacy over its western counterpart.{{Sfn|S\u00fc\u00df|2019}} In the Ottoman Empire itself, the idea that the sultan was a universal ruler lingered on despite his recognition of the Holy Roman emperor as an equal. Writing in 1798, the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Anthemus of Jerusalem|Anthemus]], saw the Ottoman Empire as imposed by God himself as the supreme empire on Earth and something which had arisen due to the dealings of the Palaiologan emperors with the western Christians:{{Sfn|Nicol|1967|p=334}}{{Cquote\n| quote = Behold how our merciful and omniscient Lord has managed to preserve the integrity of our holy Orthodox faith and to save (us) all; he brought forth out of nothing the powerful Empire of the Ottomans, which he set up in the place of our Empire of the Romaioi, which had begun in some ways to deviate from the path of the Orthodox faith; and he raised this Empire of the Ottomans above every other in order to prove beyond doubt that it came into being by the will of God .... For there is no authority except that deriving from God.\n}}\nThe Holy Roman idea that the empire located primarily in Germany constituted the only legitimate empire eventually gave rise to the association with Germany and the imperial title, rather than associating it with the ancient Romans. The earliest mention of \"the Holy Roman Empire of ''the German Nation''\" (a phrase rarely used officially) is from the 15th century and its later increasingly used shorthand, ''imperium Romano-Germanicum'', demonstrates that contemporaries of the empire increasingly saw the empire and its emperors not as successors of a Roman Empire that had existed since Antiquity but instead as a new entity that appeared in medieval Germany whose rulers were referred to as \"emperors\" for political and historical reasons. In the 16th century up to modern times, the term \"emperor\" was thus also increasingly applied to rulers of other countries.{{sfn|Velde|2002}} The Holy Roman emperors themselves maintained that they were the successors of the ancient Roman emperors up until the abdication of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], the final Holy Roman emperor, in 1806.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=|pp=17\u201320}}\n\n== Holy Roman\u2013Russian dispute ==\n[[File:1-rubl-1723-A.png|thumb|Coin of [[Russian Emperor]] (Tsar) [[Peter the Great|Peter I]], with the emperor being depicted with a [[laurel wreath]], as ancient [[Roman emperors]] were on their coins.]]\nBy the time of the first embassy from the Holy Roman Empire to [[Russian Tsardom|Russia]] in 1488, \"the two-emperor problem had [already] translated to Moscow.\"{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=153}} In 1472, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], [[Grand Prince of Moscow]], married the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Zoe Palaiologina]], and informally declared himself ''[[tsar]]'' (emperor) of all the Russian principalities. In 1480, he stopped paying tribute to the [[Golden Horde]] and adopted the imperial [[double-headed eagle]] as one of his symbols. A distinct Russian theory of ''translatio imperii'' was developed by Abbot [[Philotheus of Pskov]]. In this doctrine, the first Rome fell to heresy (Catholicism) and the second Rome (Constantinople) to the infidel, but [[Moscow, third Rome|the third Rome (Moscow)]] would endure until the end of the world.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\nIn 1488, Ivan III demanded recognition of his title as the equivalent of emperor, but this was refused by the Holy Roman emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] and other western European rulers. [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] went even further in his imperial claims. He [[The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir|claimed to be a descendant of the first Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]], and at his [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]] as Tsar in 1561 he used a [[Church Slavonic language|Slavic]] translation of the Byzantine coronation service and what he claimed was Byzantine [[Regalia of the Russian tsars|regalia]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\nAccording to [[Marshall Poe]], the Third Rome theory first spread among clerics, and for much of its early history still regarded Moscow subordinate to Constantinople (''[[Tsargrad]]''), a position also held by Ivan IV.{{sfn|Poe|1997|pp=6}} Poe argues that Philotheus' doctrine of Third Rome may have been mostly forgotten in Russia, relegated to the [[Old Believers]], until shortly before the development of [[Pan-Slavism]]. Hence the idea could not have directly influenced the foreign policies of Peter and Catherine, though those Tsars did compare themselves to the Romans. An expansionist version of Third Rome reappeared primarily after the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1855, a lens through which later Russian writers would re-interpret Early Modern Russia, arguably anachronistically.{{sfn|Poe|1997|pp=4-7}}\n\nPrior to the [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|embassy of Peter the Great in 1697\u20131698]], the tsarist government had a poor understanding of the Holy Roman Empire and its constitution. Under Peter, use of the double-headed eagle increased and other less Byzantine symbols of the Roman past were adopted, as when the tsar was portrayed as an ancient emperor on coins minted after the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. The [[Great Northern War]] brought Russia into alliance with several north German princes and Russian troops fought in northern Germany. In 1718, Peter published a letter sent to Tsar [[Vasily III]] by the Holy Roman emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1514 in which the emperor addressed the Russian as ''Kaiser'' and implicitly his equal. In October 1721, he took the title ''imperator''. The Holy Roman emperors refused to recognise this new title. Peter's proposal that the Russian and German monarchs alternate as premier rulers in Europe was also rejected. The Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], supported by France, insisted that there could only be one emperor.{{sfn|Wilson|2016|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\nIn 1726, Charles VI entered into an alliance with Russia and formally recognized the title of ''imperator'' but without admitting the Russian ruler's parity. Three times between 1733 and 1762 Russian troops fought alongside Austrians inside the empire. The ruler of Russia from 1762 until 1796, [[Catherine the Great]], was a German princess. In 1779 she helped broker the [[Peace of Teschen]] that ended the [[War of the Bavarian Succession]].

The [[Dartford Crossing]] (A282) is part of the orbital route but is not part of the motorway. The M25 is one of the most important roads in Britain and one of the busiest. The final section was opened by the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986; on opening it was the longest [[ring road]] in Europe at {{convert|117|mi}}.\n\n[[Patrick Abercrombie]] had proposed an orbital motorway around London in the 1944 ''[[Greater London Plan]]'', which evolved into the [[London Ringways]] project in the early 1960s. By 1966, planning had started on two projects, [[Ringway 3]] to the north and [[Ringway 4]] to the south. By the time the first sections opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways would be combined into a single orbital motorway. The M25 was one of the first motorway projects to consider environmental concerns and almost 40 public inquiries took place. The road was built as planned despite some protest that included the section over the [[North Downs]] and around [[Epping Forest]] which required an extension of the [[Bell Common Tunnel]].\n\nAlthough the M25 was popular during construction, it quickly became apparent that there was insufficient traffic capacity. Because of the public inquiries, several junctions merely served local roads where office and retail developments were built, attracting even more traffic onto the M25 than it was designed for. The congestion has led to traffic management schemes that include [[variable speed limit]] and [[smart motorway]]. Since opening, the M25 has been progressively widened, particularly near [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\n==Description==\n===Route===\n[[File:M23-M25 Intersection - geograph.org.uk - 15455.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stack interchange#four-level stack|Four-level stack]] where the M25 meets the [[M23 motorway|M23]]]]\nThe M25 almost completely encircles [[Greater London]] and passes briefly through it to the east.

Following the war, 11 separate [[county council]]s told the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] that an orbital route was \"first priority\" for London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nPlans stalled because the route was planned to pass through several urban areas, which attracted criticism. The original D Ring through north-west London was intended to be a simple upgrade of streets. In 1951, Middlesex County Council planned a route for the orbital road through the county, passing through [[Eastcote]] and west of [[Bushey]], connecting with the proposed [[M1 motorway]], but it was rejected by the Ministry two years later. An alternative route via [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[Ealing]] was proposed, but this was abandoned after the council revealed the extent of property demolition required.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nIn 1964, the [[London County Council]] announced the [[London Ringways]] plan, to consist of four concentric motorway rings around London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=43,112}} The following year, the transport minister [[Barbara Castle]] announced that the D Ring would be essential to build. The component parts of what became the M25 came from [[Ringway 3]] / [[M16 motorway]] in the north and [[Ringway 4]] in the south.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nThe Ringways plan was controversial owing to the destruction required for the inner two ring roads, ([[Ringway 1]] and [[Ringway 2]]). Parts of Ringway 1 were constructed (including the [[West Cross Route]]), despite stiff opposition, before the overall plan was postponed in February 1972. In April 1973, the [[Greater London Council]] elections resulted in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] victory; the party then formally announced the cancellation of the Ringways running inside Greater London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=103}} This did not affect the routes that would become the M25, because they were planned as central government projects from the outset.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=111}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:M25 - Work In Progress at Tatling End - geograph.org.uk - 37213.jpg|thumb|View north from Higher [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] Fire Station at Tatling End on the A40 in July 1984, with the [[Chiltern Main Line]] five-arch 1906 [[Chalfont Viaduct]], originally built to straddle the [[River Misbourne]] ]]\nThere was no individual [[public inquiry]] into the M25 as a whole.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=116}} Each section was presented to planning authorities in its own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquiries relating to sections of the route.

It was originally proposed as an all-purpose route, but was upgraded to motorway standard in 1966. It was the first section of the route announced as M25 from the beginning.

This scheme required two additional sections to join what were two different schemes, from Swanley to Sevenoaks in the south-east and Hunton Bridge to Potters Bar in the north-west.

The [[Dartford Crossing]] (A282) is part of the orbital route but is not part of the motorway. The M25 is one of the most important roads in Britain and one of the busiest. The final section was opened by the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1986; on opening it was the longest [[ring road]] in Europe at {{convert|117|mi}}.\n\n[[Patrick Abercrombie]] had proposed an orbital motorway around London in the 1944 ''[[Greater London Plan]]'', which evolved into the [[London Ringways]] project in the early 1960s. By 1966, planning had started on two projects, [[Ringway 3]] to the north and [[Ringway 4]] to the south. By the time the first sections opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways would be combined into a single orbital motorway. The M25 was one of the first motorway projects to consider environmental concerns and almost 40 public inquiries took place. The road was built as planned despite some protest that included the section over the [[North Downs]] and around [[Epping Forest]] which required an extension of the [[Bell Common Tunnel]].\n\nAlthough the M25 was popular during construction, it quickly became apparent that there was insufficient traffic capacity. Because of the public inquiries, several junctions merely served local roads where office and retail developments were built, attracting even more traffic onto the M25 than it was designed for. The congestion has led to traffic management schemes that include [[variable speed limit]] and [[smart motorway]]. Since opening, the M25 has been progressively widened, particularly near [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\n==Description==\n===Route===\n[[File:M23-M25 Intersection - geograph.org.uk - 15455.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stack interchange#four-level stack|Four-level stack]] where the M25 meets the [[M23 motorway|M23]]]]\nThe M25 almost completely encircles [[Greater London]] and passes briefly through it to the east.

Following the war, 11 separate [[county council]]s told the [[Ministry of Transport (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Transport]] that an orbital route was \"first priority\" for London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nPlans stalled because the route was planned to pass through several urban areas, which attracted criticism. The original D Ring through north-west London was intended to be a simple upgrade of streets. In 1951, Middlesex County Council planned a route for the orbital road through the county, passing through [[Eastcote]] and west of [[Bushey]], connecting with the proposed [[M1 motorway]], but it was rejected by the Ministry two years later. An alternative route via [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and [[Ealing]] was proposed, but this was abandoned after the council revealed the extent of property demolition required.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nIn 1964, the [[London County Council]] announced the [[London Ringways]] plan, to consist of four concentric motorway rings around London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=43,112}} The following year, the transport minister [[Barbara Castle]] announced that the D Ring would be essential to build. The component parts of what became the M25 came from [[Ringway 3]] / [[M16 motorway]] in the north and [[Ringway 4]] in the south.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=113}}\n\nThe Ringways plan was controversial owing to the destruction required for the inner two ring roads, ([[Ringway 1]] and [[Ringway 2]]). Parts of Ringway 1 were constructed (including the [[West Cross Route]]), despite stiff opposition, before the overall plan was postponed in February 1972. In April 1973, the [[Greater London Council]] elections resulted in a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] victory; the party then formally announced the cancellation of the Ringways running inside Greater London.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=103}} This did not affect the routes that would become the M25, because they were planned as central government projects from the outset.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=111}}\n\n===Construction===\n[[File:M25 - Work In Progress at Tatling End - geograph.org.uk - 37213.jpg|thumb|View north from Higher [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]] Fire Station at Tatling End on the A40 in July 1984, with the [[Chiltern Main Line]] five-arch 1906 [[Chalfont Viaduct]], originally built to straddle the [[River Misbourne]] ]]\nThere was no individual [[public inquiry]] into the M25 as a whole.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=116}} Each section was presented to planning authorities in its own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquiries relating to sections of the route. The need for the ministry to negotiate with local councils meant that more junctions with local traffic were built than originally proposed.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=117}} A report in 1981 showed that the M25 had the potential to attract office and retail development along its route, negating the proposed traffic improvements and making Central London a less desirable place to work.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=118}} None of the motorway was prevented from being built by objections at the public inquiries.{{sfn|Hamilton|2015|p=11}} However, as a consequence of the backlash against the Ringways, and criticism at the public inquiries, the motorway was built with environmental concerns in mind. New features included additional earth mounds, cuttings and fences that reduced noise, and over two million trees and shrubs to hide the view of the road.{{sfn|Moran|2009|pp=208\u2013209}}\n\nConstruction of parts of the two outer ring roads, Ringways 3 and 4, began in 1973.

A route was fixed in 1978, with objections delaying the start of construction in 1982.{{sfn|Hamilton|2015|p=11}}\n\nThe southern section of what became the M25 through Surrey and Kent was first conceived to be an east\u2013west road south of London to relieve the [[A25 road|A25]], and running parallel to it, with its eastern end following the route of what is now the [[M26 motorway|M26]]. It was originally proposed as an all-purpose route, but was upgraded to motorway standard in 1966. It was the first section of the route announced as M25 from the beginning. The first section from [[Godstone]] to [[Reigate]] (Junctions 6 to 8) was first planned in 1966 and opened in February 1976.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=115}}<ref name=tmad/> A section of Ringway 3 south of the river between Dartford and Swanley (Junctions 1 to 3) was constructed between May 1974 and April 1977.<ref name=tmad/>\n\n[[File:Bell Common Tunnel - geograph.org.uk - 53233.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the [[bell Common#Tunnel|Bell Common Tunnel]] near [[Epping, Essex|Epping]]]]\nIn 1975, following extensive opposition to some parts of Ringway 3 through Middlesex and South London, the transport minister [[John Gilbert, Baron Gilbert|John Gilbert]] announced that the north section of Ringway 3 already planned would be combined with the southern section of Ringway 4, forming a single orbital motorway to be known as the M25, and the M16 designation was dropped. This scheme required two additional sections to join what were two different schemes, from Swanley to Sevenoaks in the south-east and Hunton Bridge to Potters Bar in the north-west. The section of Ringway 3 west of South Mimms anti-clockwise around London to Swanley in Kent was cancelled.{{sfn|Asher|2018|p=116}}\n\nThe section from Potters Bar to the [[Dartford Tunnel]] was constructed in stages from June 1979 onwards, with the final section between [[Waltham Cross]] (Junction 25) to [[Theydon Garnon]] (Junction 27) opening in January 1984.<ref name=tmad/> This section, running through [[Epping Forest]], attracted opposition and protests.

{"title_page": "Light-gas gun", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Shield gun.jpg|thumb|300px|A light-gas gun at [[Rice University]]. Using hydrogen gas and powered by a [[shotgun shell]], it achieves a velocity of 7&nbsp;km/s. Used during the development of the [[Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope]] shield.]]\nThe '''light-gas gun''' is an apparatus for physics experiments, a highly specialized gun designed to generate very high velocities. It is usually used to study high-speed [[Ballistic impact|impact phenomena]] ([[hypervelocity]] research), such as the formation of [[impact crater]]s by [[meteorite]]s or the erosion of materials by [[micrometeoroid]]s. Some basic materials research relies on projectile impact to create high pressure: such systems are capable of forcing [[liquid hydrogen]] into [[metallic hydrogen|a metallic state]].\n\n==Operation==\n\nA light-gas gun works on the same principle as a [[Air gun#Spring-piston|spring piston airgun]]. A large-diameter piston is used to force a gaseous working fluid through a smaller-diameter barrel containing the projectile to be accelerated. This reduction in diameter acts as a lever, increasing the speed while decreasing the pressure. In an airgun, the large piston is powered by a spring or compressed air, and the working fluid is atmospheric air.\n\nIn a light-gas gun, the piston is powered by a chemical reaction (usually [[gunpowder]]), and the working fluid is a lighter gas, such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]] (though helium is much safer to work with, hydrogen offers the best performance [as explained below] and causes less launch-tube erosion). One addition that a light-gas gun adds to the airgun is a rupture disk, which is a disk (usually metal) of carefully calibrated thickness designed to act as a valve. When the pressure builds up to the desired level behind the disk, the disk tears open, allowing the high-pressure, light gas to pass into the barrel. This ensures that the maximum amount of energy is available when the projectile begins moving.\n[[Image:Light-gas gun.svg|thumb|450px|Diagram of a light-gas gun<br>\n'''1''' \u2014 Breech block<br>\n'''2''' \u2014 Chamber<br>\n'''3''' \u2014 Propellant charge (gunpowder)<br>\n'''4''' \u2014 Piston<br>\n'''5''' \u2014 Pump tube<br>\n'''6''' \u2014 Light gas (helium or hydrogen)<br>\n'''7''' \u2014 Rupture disk<br>\n'''8''' \u2014 High pressure coupling<br>\n'''9''' \u2014 Projectile<br>\n'''10''' \u2014 Gun barrel]]\nOne particular light-gas gun used by [[NASA]] uses a modified 40\u2013mm cannon for power. The cannon uses gunpowder to propel a plastic (usually [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]]) piston down the cannon barrel, which is filled with high-pressure hydrogen gas. At the end of the cannon barrel is a conical section, leading down to the 5-mm barrel that fires the projectile. In this conical section is a stainless steel disk, approximately 2&nbsp;mm thick, with an \"x\" pattern scored into the surface in the middle. When the hydrogen develops sufficient pressure to burst the scored section of the disk, the hydrogen flows through the hole and accelerates the projectile to a velocity of {{convert|6|km/s|km/h|abbr=on}} in a distance of about a meter.\n\nNASA also operates light-gas guns with launch tube sizes ranging from {{convert|0.170|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} at [[Ames Research Center]]. Hazardous testing<ref name=\"WSTF\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/ |title=Remote Hypervelocity Test Facility |date=2014-07-31 |publisher=[[NASA]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730025908/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/laboratories/hypervelocity/ |archivedate=2014-07-30 }}</ref> is conducted at [[White Sands Test Facility]]. These guns have been used in support of various missions beginning with [[Apollo program]] reentry studies in the 1960s and most recently for high-speed thermal imaging. Velocities ranging from 1&nbsp;km/s up to 8.5&nbsp;km/s can be achieved. The largest of these involves a {{convert|6.25|in|sing=on}} diameter piston weighing more than {{convert|46|lb}} to compress the hydrogen.\n\n[[Image:AEDC Range-G Launcher facility.jpg|thumb|250px|Two light-gas guns at [[Arnold Air Force Base]]'s Hypervelocity Ballistics Ranges.]]\n[[Arnold Air Force Base]]'s [[Range-G]] is the \"largest routinely operated two-stage, light-gas gun system in the United States\".<ref name=\"AEDC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13498 |title=Hypervelocity Range Facility |date=2008-12-11 |publisher=Arnold Air Force Base |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318111929/http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13498 |archivedate=2013-03-18 }}</ref> Range-G utilizes interchangeable launch tubes ranging from a bore diameter of {{convert|3.3|in}} to {{convert|8.0|in}} with a {{convert|14.0|in|sing=on}} piston weighing up to {{convert|2300|lb}}.  Projectile velocities can reach {{convert|4.5|km/s|km/h}} for the {{convert|8.0|in|sing=on}} configuration and {{convert|7|km/s|km/h}} for the {{convert|3.3|in|sing=on}} launcher configuration.<ref name=\"AEDC\" /> The primary use of the range facilities at Arnold Air Force Base is the measurement of released kinetic energy upon projectile impact.\n\n===Design physics===\nThe muzzle velocity of an [[airgun]], [[firearm]], or light-gas gun is limited by, but not limited to, the [[speed of sound]] in the working fluid\u2014the air, burning gunpowder, or a light gas. Up to the speed of sound, thermodynamics provides a simple, approximate calculation approach: the projectile is accelerated by the pressure difference between its ends, and since such a pressure wave cannot propagate any faster than the speed of sound in the medium, thermodynamic analysis suggests that the muzzle velocity is limited to the speed of sound. However, beyond the speed of sound, the [[kinetic theory of gases]], which determines the speed of sound, provides a more detailed analysis in terms of the gas particles that comprise the working fluid. Kinetic theory indicates that the velocity of the gas particles is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed]], with the velocity of a large fraction of the particles exceeding the speed of sound in the gas. That fraction of the gas can continue to apply pressure to and therefore accelerate the projectile beyond the speed of sound in diminishing amounts as the projectiles speed increases.\n\nThe speed of sound in helium is about three times that in air, and in hydrogen 3.8 times that in air. The speed of sound also increases with the temperature of the fluid (but is independent of the pressure), so the heat formed by the compression of the working fluid serves to increase the maximum possible speed. Spring piston airguns increase the temperature of the air in the chamber by [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic heating]]; this raises the local speed of sound enough to overcome frictional and other efficiency losses and propel the projectile at more than the speed of sound in the ambient conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun===\nThe hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun works on similar principles of the standard light-gas gun, but adds an electric arc to heat the light gas to a higher temperature and pressure than the piston alone. The arc is applied in the chamber containing the light gas, raising the temperature and pressure to the point where the gas both breaks the bursting disk and ignites the propellant behind the piston, which is perforated to allow ignition. The resulting combination of electrical heating and piston compression provide higher pressures and temperatures, resulting in more power and a higher potential speed than a standard light-gas gun.<ref>{{patent|US|5429030|Hybrid electrothermal light gas gun and method}}</ref><ref>[http://google.com/patents/US5429030 Hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun and method], United States Patent 5,429,030 Tidman July 4, 1995</ref>\n\n===Impact profile===\n[[File:SDIO KEW Lexan projectile.jpg|thumb|250px|In this Kinetic Energy Weapon test, a seven-gram Lexan projectile was fired from a light-gas gun at a velocity of 23,000 feet per second (7,000 m/s; 16,000 mph) at a cast aluminum block.]]\nWhen the projectile fired by a light-gas gun impacts its target, the pressure applied depends upon the mass of the projectile and the surface area, or cross-section, over which the impact force is distributed. Because air-launched projectiles experience friction with air molecules, drag increases proportionally to increased projectile surface area, which results in slower velocities the larger the surface area of a projectile is. As such, a [[Density|dense]] and narrow projectile will apply more pressure overall than a light<!-- Re. \"light\": The intention is actually \"low density\" or \"composed of a light substance\", are there better words? --> and wide one. Looking at constant cross-sectional projectiles, researchers have recently begun to vary their projectiles' density as a function of length. Since the projectiles travel at a known velocity, changes in density as a function of length have a predictable relationship to the impact pressure applied as a function of time.

Used during the development of the [[Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope]] shield.]]\nThe '''light-gas gun''' is an apparatus for physics experiments, a highly specialized gun designed to generate very high velocities. It is usually used to study high-speed [[Ballistic impact|impact phenomena]] ([[hypervelocity]] research), such as the formation of [[impact crater]]s by [[meteorite]]s or the erosion of materials by [[micrometeoroid]]s. Some basic materials research relies on projectile impact to create high pressure: such systems are capable of forcing [[liquid hydrogen]] into [[metallic hydrogen|a metallic state]].\n\n==Operation==\n\nA light-gas gun works on the same principle as a [[Air gun#Spring-piston|spring piston airgun]]. A large-diameter piston is used to force a gaseous working fluid through a smaller-diameter barrel containing the projectile to be accelerated. This reduction in diameter acts as a lever, increasing the speed while decreasing the pressure. In an airgun, the large piston is powered by a spring or compressed air, and the working fluid is atmospheric air.\n\nIn a light-gas gun, the piston is powered by a chemical reaction (usually [[gunpowder]]), and the working fluid is a lighter gas, such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]] (though helium is much safer to work with, hydrogen offers the best performance [as explained below] and causes less launch-tube erosion). One addition that a light-gas gun adds to the airgun is a rupture disk, which is a disk (usually metal) of carefully calibrated thickness designed to act as a valve. When the pressure builds up to the desired level behind the disk, the disk tears open, allowing the high-pressure, light gas to pass into the barrel. This ensures that the maximum amount of energy is available when the projectile begins moving.\n[[Image:Light-gas gun.svg|thumb|450px|Diagram of a light-gas gun<br>\n'''1''' \u2014 Breech block<br>\n'''2''' \u2014 Chamber<br>\n'''3''' \u2014 Propellant charge (gunpowder)<br>\n'''4''' \u2014 Piston<br>\n'''5''' \u2014 Pump tube<br>\n'''6''' \u2014 Light gas (helium or hydrogen)<br>\n'''7''' \u2014 Rupture disk<br>\n'''8''' \u2014 High pressure coupling<br>\n'''9''' \u2014 Projectile<br>\n'''10''' \u2014 Gun barrel]]\nOne particular light-gas gun used by [[NASA]] uses a modified 40\u2013mm cannon for power. The cannon uses gunpowder to propel a plastic (usually [[High-density polyethylene|HDPE]]) piston down the cannon barrel, which is filled with high-pressure hydrogen gas. At the end of the cannon barrel is a conical section, leading down to the 5-mm barrel that fires the projectile. In this conical section is a stainless steel disk, approximately 2&nbsp;mm thick, with an \"x\" pattern scored into the surface in the middle. When the hydrogen develops sufficient pressure to burst the scored section of the disk, the hydrogen flows through the hole and accelerates the projectile to a velocity of {{convert|6|km/s|km/h|abbr=on}} in a distance of about a meter.\n\nNASA also operates light-gas guns with launch tube sizes ranging from {{convert|0.170|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in|abbr=on}} at [[Ames Research Center]].

These guns have been used in support of various missions beginning with [[Apollo program]] reentry studies in the 1960s and most recently for high-speed thermal imaging. Velocities ranging from 1&nbsp;km/s up to 8.5&nbsp;km/s can be achieved. The largest of these involves a {{convert|6.25|in|sing=on}} diameter piston weighing more than {{convert|46|lb}} to compress the hydrogen.\n\n[[Image:AEDC Range-G Launcher facility.jpg|thumb|250px|Two light-gas guns at [[Arnold Air Force Base]]'s Hypervelocity Ballistics Ranges.]]\n[[Arnold Air Force Base]]'s [[Range-G]] is the \"largest routinely operated two-stage, light-gas gun system in the United States\".<ref name=\"AEDC\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13498 |title=Hypervelocity Range Facility |date=2008-12-11 |publisher=Arnold Air Force Base |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318111929/http://www.arnold.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=13498 |archivedate=2013-03-18 }}</ref> Range-G utilizes interchangeable launch tubes ranging from a bore diameter of {{convert|3.3|in}} to {{convert|8.0|in}} with a {{convert|14.0|in|sing=on}} piston weighing up to {{convert|2300|lb}}.  Projectile velocities can reach {{convert|4.5|km/s|km/h}} for the {{convert|8.0|in|sing=on}} configuration and {{convert|7|km/s|km/h}} for the {{convert|3.3|in|sing=on}} launcher configuration.<ref name=\"AEDC\" /> The primary use of the range facilities at Arnold Air Force Base is the measurement of released kinetic energy upon projectile impact.\n\n===Design physics===\nThe muzzle velocity of an [[airgun]], [[firearm]], or light-gas gun is limited by, but not limited to, the [[speed of sound]] in the working fluid\u2014the air, burning gunpowder, or a light gas. Up to the speed of sound, thermodynamics provides a simple, approximate calculation approach: the projectile is accelerated by the pressure difference between its ends, and since such a pressure wave cannot propagate any faster than the speed of sound in the medium, thermodynamic analysis suggests that the muzzle velocity is limited to the speed of sound. However, beyond the speed of sound, the [[kinetic theory of gases]], which determines the speed of sound, provides a more detailed analysis in terms of the gas particles that comprise the working fluid. Kinetic theory indicates that the velocity of the gas particles is [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distributed]], with the velocity of a large fraction of the particles exceeding the speed of sound in the gas. That fraction of the gas can continue to apply pressure to and therefore accelerate the projectile beyond the speed of sound in diminishing amounts as the projectiles speed increases.\n\nThe speed of sound in helium is about three times that in air, and in hydrogen 3.8 times that in air. The speed of sound also increases with the temperature of the fluid (but is independent of the pressure), so the heat formed by the compression of the working fluid serves to increase the maximum possible speed. Spring piston airguns increase the temperature of the air in the chamber by adiabatic heating; this raises the local speed of sound enough to overcome frictional and other efficiency losses and propel the projectile at more than the speed of sound in the ambient conditions.\n\n===Hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun===\nThe hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun works on similar principles of the standard light-gas gun, but adds an electric arc to heat the light gas to a higher temperature and pressure than the piston alone. The arc is applied in the chamber containing the light gas, raising the temperature and pressure to the point where the gas both breaks the bursting disk and ignites the propellant behind the piston, which is perforated to allow ignition. The resulting combination of electrical heating and piston compression provide higher pressures and temperatures, resulting in more power and a higher potential speed than a standard light-gas gun.<ref>{{patent|US|5429030|Hybrid electrothermal light gas gun and method}}</ref><ref>[http://google.com/patents/US5429030 Hybrid electrothermal light-gas gun and method], United States Patent 5,429,030 Tidman July 4, 1995</ref>\n\n===Impact profile===\n[[File:SDIO KEW Lexan projectile.jpg|thumb|250px|In this Kinetic Energy Weapon test, a seven-gram Lexan projectile was fired from a light-gas gun at a velocity of 23,000 feet per second (7,000 m/s; 16,000 mph) at a cast aluminum block.]]\nWhen the projectile fired by a light-gas gun impacts its target, the pressure applied depends upon the mass of the projectile and the surface area, or cross-section, over which the impact force is distributed. Because air-launched projectiles experience friction with air molecules, drag increases proportionally to increased projectile surface area, which results in slower velocities the larger the surface area of a projectile is. As such, a [[Density|dense]] and narrow projectile will apply more pressure overall than a light<!-- Re. \"light\": The intention is actually \"low density\" or \"composed of a light substance\", are there better words? --> and wide one. Looking at constant cross-sectional projectiles, researchers have recently begun to vary their projectiles' density as a function of length. Since the projectiles travel at a known velocity, changes in density as a function of length have a predictable relationship to the impact pressure applied as a function of time. With materials in a wide range of densities (from [[tungsten]] powder to [[glass microsphere]]s) applied in thin layers, carefully made projectiles can be used in constant-pressure experiments, or even controlled compression\u2013expansion\u2013compression sequences.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Combustion light-gas gun]], a high-velocity gun that uses combusted gas as propellant.\n* [[Ram accelerator]], a high-velocity gun that uses different principles to achieve similar projectile velocities.\n* [[Shock tube]], a tool used to demonstrate the properties of very high speed gases.\n* [[Voitenko compressor]], a [[shaped charge]] driven device which uses [[hydrogen]] gas to accelerate thin disks up to about 40&nbsp;km/s.\n* [[Super High Altitude Research Project]]\n* [[Space gun]]\n*Green Launch\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20020617165752/http://www-pat.llnl.gov/Organization/HDivision/Research/GasGun/GasGun.html Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's gas gun]\n* [http://quicklaunchinc.com/ QuickLaunch, aka TekLaunch, plans to commercialize a 1 km hydrogen gun to launch fuel to low earth orbit]\n* [https://www.amotronics.de/en/measurement/sequencer.html Test Sequencer and high-speed camera controller with real-time reaction to hypervelocity events and trigger prediction capabilities]\n\n\n[[Category:Ballistics]]\n[[Category:Space guns]]\n", "name_user": "Qi Zhengyuan 1123", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDesign physics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-gas_gun"}

It is situated on the [[A30 road]], {{convert|20|miles|km|0}} west of [[Salisbury, Wiltshire|Salisbury]], near to the border with [[Wiltshire]]. It is the only significant hilltop settlement in Dorset, being built about {{convert|215|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on a [[greensand]] hill on the edge of [[Cranborne Chase]].

From different viewpoints, it is possible to see at least as far as [[Glastonbury Tor]] to the northwest.\n\nShaftesbury is the site of the former [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], which was founded in 888 by [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] and became one of the richest religious establishments in the country, before being destroyed in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]] in 1539.

Edwardstow, Shaftesbury's oldest surviving building, was built on Bimport at some time between 1400 and 1539. Also in this period a medieval farm owned by the Abbess of Shaftesbury was established, on a site now occupied by the Tesco supermarket car park.\n[[File:Edwardstowe, Shaftesbury - geograph.org.uk - 224159.jpg|thumb|Edwardstow]]\n\nIn 1539, the last Abbess of Shaftesbury, Elizabeth Zouche, signed a deed of surrender, the (by then extremely wealthy) abbey was demolished, and its lands sold, leading to a temporary decline in the town. [[Thomas Arundell of Wardour Castle|Sir Thomas Arundell]] purchased the abbey and much of the town in 1540, but when he was later exiled for treason his lands were forfeit, and the lands passed to Pembroke then [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]], and finally to the Grosvenors.\n\nShaftesbury was a parliamentary constituency returning two members from 1296 to the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], when it was reduced to one, and in 1884 the separate constituency was abolished.\n\nIn ''Survey of Dorsetshire'', written in about 1630 by Thomas Gerard of the Dorset village of [[Trent, Dorset|Trent]], Shaftesbury is described as a \"faire Thorough Faire, much frequented by Travellers to and from London\".<ref>Bettey, p129</ref>\n\nThe town was broadly Parliamentarian in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], but was in Royalist hands. [[Wardour Castle]] fell to Parliamentary forces in 1643; Parliamentary forces surrounded the town in August 1645, when it was a centre of local [[clubmen]] activity.

It is situated on the [[A30 road]], {{convert|20|miles|km|0}} west of [[Salisbury, Wiltshire|Salisbury]], near to the border with [[Wiltshire]]. It is the only significant hilltop settlement in Dorset, being built about {{convert|215|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] on a [[greensand]] hill on the edge of [[Cranborne Chase]]. Shaftesbury also refers to a former carehome, located in Exeter, prominent during the 20th and early 21st centuries.  \n\nThe town looks over the [[Blackmore Vale]], part of the [[River Stour, Dorset|River Stour]] basin. From different viewpoints, it is possible to see at least as far as [[Glastonbury Tor]] to the northwest.\n\nShaftesbury is the site of the former [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], which was founded in 888 by [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] and became one of the richest religious establishments in the country, before being destroyed in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|Dissolution]] in 1539.

[[Thomas Arundell of Wardour Castle|Sir Thomas Arundell]] purchased the abbey and much of the town in 1540, but when he was later exiled for treason his lands were forfeit, and the lands passed to Pembroke then [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]], and finally to the Grosvenors.\n\nShaftesbury was a parliamentary constituency returning two members from 1296 to the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act of 1832]], when it was reduced to one, and in 1884 the separate constituency was abolished.\n\nIn ''Survey of Dorsetshire'', written in about 1630 by Thomas Gerard of the Dorset village of [[Trent, Dorset|Trent]], Shaftesbury is described as a \"faire Thorough Faire, much frequented by Travellers to and from London\".<ref>Bettey, p129</ref>\n\nThe town was broadly Parliamentarian in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], but was in Royalist hands.
