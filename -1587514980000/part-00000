Some of the first people to enter the [[San Luis Valley]] and the Great Sand Dunes area were [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s whose connection to the area centered around the herds of [[mammoth]]s and prehistoric [[bison]]. They were [[Stone Age]] people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as [[Clovis point|Clovis]] and [[Folsom point]]s. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.<ref name=History>{{NPS| url=https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/historyculture/index.htm |work=Great Sand Dunes National Park |title= History & Culture|date=January 16, 2018\n |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029155322/https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/historyculture/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nModern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes were familiar with the area when [[Spaniards]] first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional [[Ute people#Southern Ute Tribe|Ute]] phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is ''Saa waap maa nache'' (sand that moves). [[Jicarilla Apache]]s settled in northern [[New Mexico]] and called the dunes ''Sei-anyedi'' (it goes up and down). [[Blanca Peak]], just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the [[Navajo]], who call it ''Sisnaajini'' (White Shell Mountain). These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the [[Tewa]]/[[Tiwa language|Tiwa]]-speaking [[pueblo]]s along the [[Rio Grande]] remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake ''Sip'ophe'' (Sandy Place Lake), which is thought to be the springs or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Exploration===\nIn 1694, [[Diego de Vargas|Don Diego de Vargas]] became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In 1776, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of [[Comanche]]s. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in [[Zebulon Pike]]'s journals of 1807. As [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark's expedition]] was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Red River of the South|Red Rivers]]. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of today's [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.<ref name=History/>\n\n{{quote|text=After marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [today's Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hills ...

Fr\u00e9mont]]]]\nIn 1848, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was hired to find a railroad route from [[St. Louis]] to [[California]]. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain [[John Williams Gunnison|John Gunnison]] of the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. Gunnison's party crossed the dunefield on horseback.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Settlement===\nIn the years that followed, the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, [[Fort Massachusetts (Colorado)|Fort Massachusetts]] was built and then relocated to [[Fort Garland]], about {{cvt|20|mi}} southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or [[La Veta Pass]], several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and [[Mosca Pass]], also called Robidoux's Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing [[Front Range|front range]] cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[File:Intermittent Medano Creek Seeps through Desert Sands.jpg|thumb|Medano Creek]]\nThe Herard family\u2014after whom [[Mount Herard]] is named<ref name=GNIS>{{cite gnis|id=192572|name=Mount Herard|accessdate=October 30, 2017}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/746W8pI84 webcitation.org])</ref>\u2014established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to [[four-wheel drive]], high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the [[Trujillo Homestead|Teofilo Trujillo family]] whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the Medano\u2013Zapata Ranch, owned by [[the Nature Conservancy]] since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado|National Historic Landmark]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=03001544}}|title=NRHP Nomination for Trujillo Homestead|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[Gold rush|Gold]] and [[silver rush]]es occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|.17|1920|r=0|fmt=c}}/ton to ${{inflation|US|3|1920|r=0}}/ton today). Active [[placer mining]] operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Preservation===\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]] and [[Monte Vista, Colorado|Monte Vista]]. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] sponsored a bill to [[United States Congress|Congress]] asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President [[Herbert Hoover]]. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monument's expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000-2004.<ref name=History/>\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:A606, Star Dune, Great Sand Dunes National Park, Colorado, United States, 2008.jpg|thumb|Summit of [[Dune#Star|Star Dune]], the tallest dune in the park, and the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]]]]\nThe park contains the tallest sand [[dune]]s in [[North America]],<ref name=ParkIndex/> rising to a maximum height of {{convert|750|ft|0}}<ref name=Dunes>[https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/dune-types.htm \"Great Sand Dunes National Park - dune types\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20181120211944/https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/dune-types.htm archive.org]). \"The tallest dune at Great Sand Dunes is 750' (229m), and known simply as The Star Dune.\" ''nps.gov''.

The [[San Juan Mountains]] to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of [[Connecticut]]. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting [[glacier]]s and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Geology>{{NPS| url=https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/sanddunes.htm |work=Great Sand Dunes National Park |title= Geology |date=February 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907045409/https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/sanddunes.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the [[Rio Grande]], likely forming the steep [[Rio Grande Gorge]] near [[Taos, New Mexico]]. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the [[sand sheet]]. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of [[sabkha]] [[wetland]]s.<ref name=Geology/>\n\n[[File:AerialGreatSandDunes.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the dunes and the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]]]]\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passes\u2014Mosca, Medano, and Music Passes\u2014and the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streams\u2014Medano and Sand Creeks\u2014also capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. [[Barchan]] and [[Dune#Crescentic or transverse|transverse dunes]] form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.<ref name=Geology/>\n\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small [[Dune#Parabolic|parabolic dunes]] continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.<ref name=Geology/>\n\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the [[late Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], during the middle years of the current [[Ice age#Glacial stages in North America|ice age]]'s [[Wisconsin glaciation|third stage]].<ref name=Geology/>\n\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of [[magnetite]], a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range.

The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[tundra]] and lakes, through [[Montane ecosystems#Subalpine zone|subalpine]] and [[Montane ecosystems#Montane forests|montane woodlands]], and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.<ref name=SandSystem/>\n\nThe dunefield is composed of [[Dune#Reversing dunes|reversing dunes]], [[Dune#Crescentic or transverse|transverse dunes]]\u2014also called crescentic or [[barchan]] dunes\u2014and [[Dune#Star|star dunes]]. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small [[Dune#Parabolic|parabolic dunes]] form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. [[Nabkha]] dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.<ref name=SandSystem/>\n\n===Flora===\n[[File:Small-Flowered Sand Verbena, Great Sand Dunes.jpg|thumb|[[Tripterocalyx micranthus|Small-flowered sand verbena]]]]\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands.

Some of the first people to enter the [[San Luis Valley]] and the Great Sand Dunes area were [[nomad]]ic [[hunter-gatherer]]s whose connection to the area centered around the herds of [[mammoth]]s and prehistoric [[bison]]. They were [[Stone Age]] people who hunted with large stone spear or dart points now identified as [[Clovis point|Clovis]] and [[Folsom point]]s. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.<ref name=History>{{NPS| url=https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/historyculture/index.htm |work=Great Sand Dunes National Park |title= History & Culture|date=January 16, 2018\n |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029155322/https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/historyculture/index.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nModern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribes were familiar with the area when [[Spaniards]] first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional [[Ute people#Southern Ute Tribe|Ute]] phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is ''Saa waap maa nache'' (sand that moves). [[Jicarilla Apache]]s settled in northern [[New Mexico]] and called the dunes ''Sei-anyedi'' (it goes up and down). [[Blanca Peak]], just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the [[Navajo]], who call it ''Sisnaajini'' (White Shell Mountain). These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the [[Tewa]]/[[Tiwa language|Tiwa]]-speaking [[pueblo]]s along the [[Rio Grande]] remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake ''Sip'ophe'' (Sandy Place Lake), which is thought to be the springs or lakes immediately west of the dunefield.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Exploration===\nIn 1694, [[Diego de Vargas|Don Diego de Vargas]] became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In 1776, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of [[Comanche]]s. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.<ref name=History/>\n\nThe first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in [[Zebulon Pike]]'s journals of 1807. As [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clark's expedition]] was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and [[Red River of the South|Red Rivers]]. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of today's [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.<ref name=History/>\n\n{{quote|text=After marching some miles, we discovered ... at the foot of the White Mountains [today's Sangre de Cristos] which we were then descending, sandy hills ...

Fr\u00e9mont]]]]\nIn 1848, [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] was hired to find a railroad route from [[St. Louis]] to [[California]]. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain [[John Williams Gunnison|John Gunnison]] of the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. Gunnison's party crossed the dunefield on horseback.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Settlement===\nIn the years that followed, the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, [[Fort Massachusetts (Colorado)|Fort Massachusetts]] was built and then relocated to [[Fort Garland]], about {{cvt|20|mi}} southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or [[La Veta Pass]], several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and [[Mosca Pass]], also called Robidoux's Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing [[Front Range|front range]] cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s, and stages and the mail route used it regularly through about 1911 when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[File:Intermittent Medano Creek Seeps through Desert Sands.jpg|thumb|Medano Creek]]\nThe Herard family\u2014after whom [[Mount Herard]] is named<ref name=GNIS>{{cite gnis|id=192572|name=Mount Herard|accessdate=October 30, 2017}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/746W8pI84 webcitation.org])</ref>\u2014established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to [[four-wheel drive]], high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the [[Trujillo Homestead|Teofilo Trujillo family]] whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the Medano\u2013Zapata Ranch, owned by [[the Nature Conservancy]] since 1999. The Trujillo's extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Colorado|National Historic Landmark]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=03001544}}|title=NRHP Nomination for Trujillo Homestead|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.<ref name=History/>\n\n[[Gold rush|Gold]] and [[silver rush]]es occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|.17|1920|r=0|fmt=c}}/ton to ${{inflation|US|3|1920|r=0}}/ton today). Active [[placer mining]] operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.<ref name=History/>\n\n===Preservation===\nThe idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]] and [[Monte Vista, Colorado|Monte Vista]]. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] sponsored a bill to [[United States Congress|Congress]] asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President [[Herbert Hoover]].

The [[San Juan Mountains]] to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of [[Connecticut]]. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting [[glacier]]s and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential [[flash flood]]s.<ref name=Geology>{{NPS| url=https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/sanddunes.htm |work=Great Sand Dunes National Park |title= Geology |date=February 25, 2017 |accessdate=September 30, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907045409/https://www.nps.gov/grsa/learn/nature/sanddunes.htm |archivedate=September 7, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after its extreme water pressure broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the [[Rio Grande]], likely forming the steep [[Rio Grande Gorge]] near [[Taos, New Mexico]]. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes in the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Dramatic natural climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the [[sand sheet]]. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of [[sabkha]] [[wetland]]s.<ref name=Geology/>\n\n[[File:AerialGreatSandDunes.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the dunes and the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]]]]\nSand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passes\u2014Mosca, Medano, and Music Passes\u2014and the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streams\u2014Medano and Sand Creeks\u2014also capture sand from the mountain side of the dunefield and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dunefield. [[Barchan]] and [[Dune#Crescentic or transverse|transverse dunes]] form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand recycling action of the creeks, are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.<ref name=Geology/>\n\nSufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor that there is little sand blowing into the main dunefield from the valley; however, small [[Dune#Parabolic|parabolic dunes]] continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dunes system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dunefield is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.<ref name=Geology/>\n\nScientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune, and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the [[late Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], during the middle years of the current [[Ice age#Glacial stages in North America|ice age]]'s [[Wisconsin glaciation|third stage]].<ref name=Geology/>\n\nThe dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of [[magnetite]], a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range.

The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[tundra]] and lakes, through [[Montane ecosystems#Subalpine zone|subalpine]] and [[Montane ecosystems#Montane forests|montane woodlands]], and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dunefield once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.<ref name=SandSystem/>\n\nThe dunefield is composed of [[Dune#Reversing dunes|reversing dunes]], [[Dune#Crescentic or transverse|transverse dunes]]\u2014also called crescentic or [[barchan]] dunes\u2014and [[Dune#Star|star dunes]]. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dunefield. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dunefield. Small [[Dune#Parabolic|parabolic dunes]] form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. [[Nabkha]] dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising ground water. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.<ref name=SandSystem/>\n\n===Flora===\n[[File:Small-Flowered Sand Verbena, Great Sand Dunes.jpg|thumb|[[Tripterocalyx micranthus|Small-flowered sand verbena]]]]\nThere are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands.

The tundra begins about {{convert|11700|ft|m|abbr=on}} and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the [[tree line]] grow [[krummholz]] (meaning \"crooked wood\")\u2014trees which are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live on tundra. [[Pinus aristata|Bristlecone]] and [[Pinus flexilis|limber pines]] grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.<ref name=Ecosystems/>\n\n[[File:River of Gold Aspens Above the Dunes (22039656735).jpg|thumb|[[Populus tremuloides|Aspens]] in a [[riparian zone]]]]\nSubalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals are found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from {{convert|9500|ft|m|abbr=on}} to tree line at {{convert|11700|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Pinus edulis|Pinyon]]-[[Juniperus scopulorum|juniper]] and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine]] woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]] and [[Populus tremuloides|aspen]] trees are in drainages. [[North American cougar|Cougars]] hunt [[mule deer]] here at night. [[Owl]]s, [[dusky grouse]], [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]], and [[bullsnake]]s all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.<ref name=Ecosystems/>\n\nThe [[riparian zone]] follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. [[Populus angustifolia|Cottonwood]] and [[Populus tremuloides|aspen]] trees, [[Cornus sericea|red osier dogwood]], and [[alder]] grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for [[American black bear|black bears]], [[American water shrew|water shrews]], and [[western tanager]]s. [[Rio Grande cutthroat trout]] are found in Medano Creek.<ref name=Ecosystems/>\n\nWhile the top few inches of the dunefield are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. Moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as [[Ord's kangaroo rat]], Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, [[scurfpea]], and [[Redfieldia|blowout grass]] to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including [[elk]], [[pronghorn]], [[American bison|bison]], [[coyote]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[Bird of prey|raptors]].<ref name=Ecosystems/>\n\n[[File:Sandhill Cranes Dancing, Dunes, and Mount Herard at Sunset (16536237127).jpg|thumb|[[Sandhill crane]]s in [[wetland]]]]\nThe sand sheet includes extensive [[grassland]]s and [[shrubland]]s that surround the dunefield on three sides, from {{convert|7500|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|8200|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

[[Wader|Shore birds]] such as the [[American avocet]] hunt [[tadpole]]s and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitat for [[sandhill crane]]s, shore birds, amphibians, [[Dragonfly|dragonflies]], and [[Caridea|freshwater shrimp]].

Curran''' (May 29, 1879 &ndash; January 24, 1941), was an Australian-born American actor on the stage and in motion pictures. Between 1915 and 1941 he appeared in 60 films, the last of which was ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in which he played the uncredited role of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the \"News on the March\" newsreel sequence.\n\n==Biography==\nThomas A. Curran was born on May 29, 1879, in Sydney, Australia. He studied acting in the United States, where he made his stage debut in 1897. After returning to Australia for a few years, he returned to the U.S. in 1912 or 1913 and worked in [[vaudeville]] and [[repertory theatre]]. He acted in the original productions of ''Excuse Me'' written by [[Rupert Hughes]] (later adapted twice for the screen) and ''[[Oh! Oh! Delphine]]''.<ref name=than/>\n\nCurran was signed to a three-year contract by the [[Thanhouser Company]] in 1915 and made 22 films, including ''[[The World and the Woman]]'' with [[Jeanne Eagels]] and ''[[Inspiration (1915 film)|Inspiration]]'', the first non-pornographic American film to show full female nudity. In his later years he moved to California and made his living playing [[bit part]]s and small roles in [[Film studio|studio]] films. His last film appearance was as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Teddy Roosevelt]] in the \"News on the March\" sequence in ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. The film had not yet been released when Curran, aged 61, died in [[Hollywood]] January 24, 1941.<ref name=than>{{cite web|url=http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Biography_Files/ind9jxyin.htm|title=Thomas A.

Meanwhile, strange occurrences are causing electronic devices to malfunction across [[Odaiba]]. Minutes before Tai is set to play a soccer match, Kuwagamon appears and invades the city, causing electronic malfunctions. Just as Tai is cornered, his Digivice shines and Agumon appears. He digivolves into Greymon and fights with Kuwagamon, ending up at [[Haneda Airport]]. Tai gives chase by hitching a ride with his homeroom teacher, Daigo Nishijima. As more Kuwagamon appear, Tai is joined by the other DigiDestined and their partner Digimon, who defeat two Kuwagamon before Alphamon intervenes and crushes the last one.\n\nAfter the battle, the DigiDestined investigate the circumstances leading up to Kuwagamon's appearance. Tai and Matt pay a visit to Nishijima, who reveals he is part of an organization monitoring Digimon activity. As Izzy develops ways to provide easier access to their partner Digimon and seek out digital disturbances, Tai begins to fear that people could get hurt as a result of his actions as a DigiDestined.\n\nAlphamon appears the next day near the [[Daikanransha]], targeting a Digimon under the care of Meiko Mochizuki, a girl who recently transferred into Tai's class. With Alphamon proving too powerful for the other Digimon, Matt urges Tai to stop running away from his fears, and together they manage to drive Alphamon off with the power of Omnimon. Afterwards, Meiko reveals that she is also a DigiDestined and the targeted Digimon is her partner, Meicoomon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 5 - 8\n| Title               = Determination\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketsui\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u610f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"Seven (tri. version)\"<br />by [[K\u014dji Wada]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|3|12}}\n| AltDate             = July 1, 2017\n| ShortSummary        = While Joe stays home to study for his exams, the DigiDestined and their Digimon go on a trip to a hot spring inn, alongside Nishijima and Himekawa. After the trip, Himekawa and Nishijima direct soldiers to use experimental weapons against an infected Ogremon that manifests in Odaiba, but Leomon takes Ogremon back to the Digital World.\n\nAs Mimi and Meiko prepare for a cheer girl caf\u00e9 for the upcoming school festival, Ogremon appears again. When Togemon inadvertently damages a helicopter, Izzy reprimands Mimi for being selfish. After Ogremon is sent back to the Digital World, Leomon visits the Real World, informing the DigiDestined that Ogremon is infected. As Mimi laments her selfishness, she hears from Joe that he is avoiding battles with the Digimon to try cope with adulthood, but loathes his own ineptness. As Gomamon decides to run away from home, Izzy receives an ominous message in digital code.\n\nOn the day of the school festival, Meiko shows Mimi her support by wearing her cheer girl outfit for the caf\u00e9, while the Digimon sneak into the festival to try and win a costume contest for free food. Afterwards, Gomamon tells Joe that he ran away, because he refused to fight together anymore, causing Joe to angrily storm off.\n\nMeicoomon is abducted by what appears to be the Digimon Emperor. Palmon, Gomamon and a now infected Leomon follow them into the digital distortion. As they combat an infected Imperialdramon, Kari urges Joe to fight by his partner's side. After overcoming his insecurities, Joe manages to digivolve Gomamon into Vikemon alongside Mimi who digivolves Palmon into Rosemon. After they defeat Imperialdramon, a traumatized Meicoomon changes form, destroys Leomon and escapes into another distortion.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 9 - 13\n| Title               = Confession\n| TranslitTitle       = Kokuhaku\n| NativeTitle         = \u544a\u767d\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = {{nihongo|\"For Me\"|\u50d5\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066|Boku ni Totte}}<br />by Knife of Day ([[Yoshimasa Hosoya]])\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|9|24}}\n| AltDate             = July 1, 2017\n| ShortSummary        = While Meiko remains traumatized by Meicoomon's betrayal, Izzy becomes irritable as he obsessively tries to determine what caused Meicoomon to become infected. Meanwhile, as malfunctions begin to disrupt airlines, Himekawa and Nishijima tell Matt about their investigation but do not disclose that Meicoomon is causing the malfunctions and that other DigiDestined have gone missing. Later, T.K. discovers something amiss with Patamon when he briefly acts violent and bites him. T.K. decides to take his partner home, prompting the other DigiDestined to do the same. T.K. eventually confesses to Meiko that Patamon is infected. Unbeknownst to T.K., Patamon is already aware of this and tearfully asks T.K. to stop him should the worst happen.\n\nThe next day as Patamon informs the other Digimon about his infection, Kari becomes possessed by Homeostasis, who cryptically warns them that the infected Digimon could potentially destroy both the Real and Digital Worlds unless a great sacrifice is made. Having overheard them, Himekawa concludes that Homeostasis might trigger a \"reboot\" to reset the Digital World the next time Meicoomon appears, in order to stop the infection. After Gatomon tells the others that this reboot would also cause them to lose all of their memories, the Digimon prepare for the worst and spend precious time with their partners, during which Agumon tells Tai about the reboot. Izzy discovers that the distortions are the result of the binary code being overwritten by a different language and comes up with a plan after Tentomon informs him of the reboot.\n\nWhen Meicoomon appears at the [[Tokyo Big Sight|Tokyo International Exhibition Center]], the DigiDestined attempt to keep her out of the Real World and trap her in a digital distortion. Meicoomon responds by digivolving into Meicrackmon. Despite T.K.'s attempts to stop him, Patamon digivolves to Angemon and enters the fray, but is overcome by his infection which soon spreads to the other Digimon. When the countdown for the reboot begins, Izzy reveals his countermeasure before the clock strikes zero: the partner Digimon must be placed within a field containing their backup data in order to preserve their memories. As Tentomon struggles with helping the others while fighting off his own infection, he digivolves into HerculesKabuterimon, captures Meicrackmon, and snaps the Digimon out of their infections, before using all of his strength to push them back into the distortion before the reboot occurs.\n\nOne week later, Meiko tells T.K. the infection originated six years ago from Meicoomon. Using the power of their Crests, the DigiDestined travel to the rebooted Digital World where they briefly encounter Alphamon fighting Jesmon. They soon reunite with their partner Digimon, who warily befriend them despite having lost their memories. Nearby, Himekawa confronts the Digimon Emperor, who is revealed to resemble Gennai but with a black outfit. Meicoomon is seen hiding behind a bush still possessing her memories of Meiko.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 14 - 17\n| Title               = Loss\n| TranslitTitle       = S\u014dshitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u55aa\u5931\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"keep on (tri. version)\"<br />by Ai Maeda\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|2|25}}\n| AltDate             = February 1, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = As the DigiDestined try to rekindle their friendship with their Rookie level partner Digimon, they briefly come across Meicoomon, who has retained her memories despite the reboot. While the others get along well with their partners, Sora has trouble reconnecting with an amnesiac Biyomon. Later that night, as Tai and Matt try to console Sora, they are suddenly attacked by Machinedramon, whose attack disperses the DigiDestined and Digimon across the Digital World.\n\nMeanwhile, Nishijima investigates Himekawa's secret files and remembers her desire to reboot the Digital World to revive her partner Megadramon, who was unable to recompose into a Digi-Egg. Nishijima meets Hackmon, who relays a warning from Homeostasis that King Drasil corrupted Gennai and is targeting \"Libra\": Meicoomon.\n\nAt the desert, Sora and Biyomon discover Meiko, who came to the Digital World in search of Meicoomon. When Meicoomon attacks them out of resentment, Meiko manages to placate her. Just then, they are attacked by Gennai who shows his true form after masquerading as the Digimon Emperor. He attempts to capture Meicoomon and Sora's Digivice but is thwarted by the other DigiDestined, who come to their aid. Gennai reveals that the reboot was all part of King Drasil's plan to create a new world order where humans and Digimon no longer interact with each other. He sends Machinedramon and MetalSeadramon after them.\n\nHimekawa reunites with Tapirmon, but realizes that he does not remember her. Tai, Matt and Kari manage to strengthen their bonds enough to digivolve their partners and defeat MetalSeadramon. When Sora risks her life to protect Biyomon, she digivolves into Phoenixmon and defeats Machinedramon, alongside Seraphimon and HerculesKabuterimon. Despite this, Gennai attacks Meiko which angers Meicoomon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 18 - 21\n| Title               = Coexistence\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u014dsei\n| NativeTitle         = \u5171\u751f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = {{nihongo|\"Words of Love\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30c8\u30d0|Ai Kotoba}}<br />by Ai Maeda & [[Ayumi Miyazaki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|9|30}}\n| AltDate             = May 10, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = An enraged Meicoomon digivolves to Meicrackmon and leaves through a distortion. Himekawa is then briefly seen stumbling across the Digital World in search of Tapirmon. As Digimon begin materializing in the Real World, Hackmon explains to Nishijima and Professor Mochizuki that Meicoomon was born from a fragment of Apocalymon's remnant data. Meiko was meant to suppress the darkness within her partner Digimon. However, Homeostasis considers Meicoomon's unrestrained power to be an existential threat to both worlds and decides to eliminate her. Meanwhile, the DigiDestined try to survive the Digital World's attempts to expel them.\n\nThe DigiDestined manage to return to the Real World but are persecuted by the people. With Nishijima's help, the DigiDestined and their partner Digimon hide in their school to avoid the media. The DigiDestined try to console Meiko during their stay. The next day, a rampant Meicrackmon confronts Meiko near the school. Jesmon intervenes and his attack results in Meicrackmon digivolving to Raguelmon.\n\nAs the situation deteriorates, Homeostasis possesses Kari and warns the DigiDestined not to interfere. When Jesmon takes Raguelmon to the Digital World, the DigiDestined, their partner Digimon, and Nishijima pursue them. They arrive in a desert area of the Digital World, where Alphamon joins the fray. Six of the Digimon return to their In-Training forms as a result of Alphamon's attack, leaving only Omnimon, Raguelmon, Alphamon and Jesmon. In the Digital World, a distressed Himekawa is still searching for Tapirmon, but finds herself in the Dark Ocean. When she seemingly drowns, Nishijima senses this and laments his inability to save her. Meiko falls into despair and asks the DigiDestined to destroy Raguelmon. Tai resolves to carry out her wish despite the objections of the other DigiDestined. During the battle, a fissure opens causing Tai and Nishijima to fall from the cliff.\n\nIn the aftermath, Raguelmon is incapacitated near Tai's goggles. Kari becomes engulfed in corrupted digital code which causes Nyaromon to digivolve into Ophanimon Falldown Mode, creating a dark portal. As the portal opens, Ophanimon merges with Raguelmon into Ordinemon. The Real World is subsequently covered by a universal blackout, as the invading Digimon become able to move. Afterwards, the Digital World begins to swallow the Real World. Refusing to give up, Matt takes Tai's goggles and rallies his friends.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 22 - 26\n| Title               = Future\n| TranslitTitle       = Bokura no Mirai\n| NativeTitle         = \u307c\u304f\u3089\u306e\u672a\u6765\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"[[Butter-Fly (K\u014dji Wada song)|Butter-Fly (tri. version)]]\"<br />by the DigiDestined,{{efn|name=a|Ensemble featuring [[Natsuki Hanae]], [[Suzuko Mimori]], [[Yoshimasa Hosoya]], [[Mutsumi Tamura]], Hitomi Yoshida, Junya Enoki, [[Junya Ikeda]], [[Mao Ichimichi]], and [[Miho Arakawa]].}} Digimon Singers,{{efn|name=b|Ensemble featuring [[Chika Sakamoto]], Atori Shigematsu, [[Mayumi Yamaguchi]], [[Takahiro Sakurai]], Shihomi Mizowaki, [[Miwa Matsumoto]], [[Junko Takeuchi]], Yuka Tokumitsu, and Yukiko Morishita.}} Ayumi Miyazaki, Ai Maeda, and K\u014dji Wada{{efn|name=c|Episodes 22 to 25 use {{nihongo|\"Words of Love\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30c8\u30d0|Ai Kotoba}} by [[Ai Maeda (voice actress)|Ai Maeda]] & [[Ayumi Miyazaki]] as the ending theme.}}\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|5|5}}\n| AltDate             = September 20, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = Believing that Tai is dead, the DigiDestined return to the Real World. Meanwhile, Tai and the injured Nishijima wake up in a facility. Nishijima reveals that Davis, Ken, Yolei and Cody are in cryostasis, and were captured, after discovering King Drasil's plan. Gennai appears and stops the life support system, forcing Tai to choose between escaping with the others or saving Nishijima. After Tai enters one of the capsules, the dying Nishijima sends them back to the Real World, before the facility explodes.\n\nWith Kari still in shock and T.K. tending to her, the other DigiDestined fight Ordinemon, but are defeated. Hackmon informs them of Homeostasis' intent to reboot all digital technology in the Real World to stop Ordinemon. However, it would cripple all man-made infrastructure. Refusing to give up, Matt and the others have Meiko lure Ordinemon to the sea and confront her again but to no avail. Kari overcomes her trauma and has a vision of Gatomon inside Ordinemon, who reveals that all light resides in Meicoomon.\n\nGuided by Kari's vision, Izzy discovers that memories from all the Digimon have a backup stored inside Meicoomon, which explains why her memories are intact. Meiko unlocks the sealed memories inside Meicoomon, restoring the lost memories and extracting Gatomon from Ordinemon. The reboot of the Real World is halted by Hackmon. However, King Drasil floods Ordinemon with corrupted data. Tai rejoins the others as they reluctantly digivolve their partner Digimon. During the course of the battle, Meiko's Digivice awakens Omnimon's Merciful Mode. Omnimon destroys Ordinemon, deleting Meicoomon in the process. Gennai leaves through a digital distortion after King Drasil's plans are thwarted.\n\nWith both worlds restored, Meiko returns to [[Tottori Prefecture|Tottori]] and Homeostasis shuts down King Drasil. Izzy begins work on a gate that would allow traversal between worlds without D-3s. Three months later on Christmas Eve, Tai converses with Meiko on the phone and Agumon interrupts by declaring that they will always be friends.\n}}\n}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{see also|List of Digimon Adventure characters}}\nThe series features the eight {{nihongo|[[List of Digimon Adventure characters#DigiDestined|DigiDestined]]|\u9078\u3070\u308c\u3057\u5b50\u4f9b\u9054|Erabareshi Kodomotachi}}<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-04-15/digimon-tri-anime-human-cast-promo-broadcast-details-unveiling-on-may-6/.87142|title=Digimon tri.

He digivolves into Greymon and fights with Kuwagamon, ending up at [[Haneda Airport]]. Tai gives chase by hitching a ride with his homeroom teacher, Daigo Nishijima. As more Kuwagamon appear, Tai is joined by the other DigiDestined and their partner Digimon, who defeat two Kuwagamon before Alphamon intervenes and crushes the last one.\n\nAfter the battle, the DigiDestined investigate the circumstances leading up to Kuwagamon's appearance. Tai and Matt pay a visit to Nishijima, who reveals he is part of an organization monitoring Digimon activity. As Izzy develops ways to provide easier access to their partner Digimon and seek out digital disturbances, Tai begins to fear that people could get hurt as a result of his actions as a DigiDestined.\n\nAlphamon appears the next day near the [[Daikanransha]], targeting a Digimon under the care of Meiko Mochizuki, a girl who recently transferred into Tai's class. With Alphamon proving too powerful for the other Digimon, Matt urges Tai to stop running away from his fears, and together they manage to drive Alphamon off with the power of Omnimon. Afterwards, Meiko reveals that she is also a DigiDestined and the targeted Digimon is her partner, Meicoomon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 5 - 8\n| Title               = Determination\n| TranslitTitle       = Ketsui\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u610f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"Seven (tri. version)\"<br />by [[K\u014dji Wada]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|3|12}}\n| AltDate             = July 1, 2017\n| ShortSummary        = While Joe stays home to study for his exams, the DigiDestined and their Digimon go on a trip to a hot spring inn, alongside Nishijima and Himekawa.

When Togemon inadvertently damages a helicopter, Izzy reprimands Mimi for being selfish. After Ogremon is sent back to the Digital World, Leomon visits the Real World, informing the DigiDestined that Ogremon is infected. As Mimi laments her selfishness, she hears from Joe that he is avoiding battles with the Digimon to try cope with adulthood, but loathes his own ineptness. As Gomamon decides to run away from home, Izzy receives an ominous message in digital code.\n\nOn the day of the school festival, Meiko shows Mimi her support by wearing her cheer girl outfit for the caf\u00e9, while the Digimon sneak into the festival to try and win a costume contest for free food. Afterwards, Gomamon tells Joe that he ran away, because he refused to fight together anymore, causing Joe to angrily storm off.\n\nMeicoomon is abducted by what appears to be the Digimon Emperor. Palmon, Gomamon and a now infected Leomon follow them into the digital distortion. As they combat an infected Imperialdramon, Kari urges Joe to fight by his partner's side. After overcoming his insecurities, Joe manages to digivolve Gomamon into Vikemon alongside Mimi who digivolves Palmon into Rosemon.

Meanwhile, as malfunctions begin to disrupt airlines, Himekawa and Nishijima tell Matt about their investigation but do not disclose that Meicoomon is causing the malfunctions and that other DigiDestined have gone missing. Later, T.K. discovers something amiss with Patamon when he briefly acts violent and bites him. T.K. decides to take his partner home, prompting the other DigiDestined to do the same. T.K. eventually confesses to Meiko that Patamon is infected. Unbeknownst to T.K., Patamon is already aware of this and tearfully asks T.K. to stop him should the worst happen.\n\nThe next day as Patamon informs the other Digimon about his infection, Kari becomes possessed by Homeostasis, who cryptically warns them that the infected Digimon could potentially destroy both the Real and Digital Worlds unless a great sacrifice is made. Having overheard them, Himekawa concludes that Homeostasis might trigger a \"reboot\" to reset the Digital World the next time Meicoomon appears, in order to stop the infection. After Gatomon tells the others that this reboot would also cause them to lose all of their memories, the Digimon prepare for the worst and spend precious time with their partners, during which Agumon tells Tai about the reboot. Izzy discovers that the distortions are the result of the binary code being overwritten by a different language and comes up with a plan after Tentomon informs him of the reboot.\n\nWhen Meicoomon appears at the [[Tokyo Big Sight|Tokyo International Exhibition Center]], the DigiDestined attempt to keep her out of the Real World and trap her in a digital distortion. Meicoomon responds by digivolving into Meicrackmon. Despite T.K.'s attempts to stop him, Patamon digivolves to Angemon and enters the fray, but is overcome by his infection which soon spreads to the other Digimon. When the countdown for the reboot begins, Izzy reveals his countermeasure before the clock strikes zero: the partner Digimon must be placed within a field containing their backup data in order to preserve their memories. As Tentomon struggles with helping the others while fighting off his own infection, he digivolves into HerculesKabuterimon, captures Meicrackmon, and snaps the Digimon out of their infections, before using all of his strength to push them back into the distortion before the reboot occurs.\n\nOne week later, Meiko tells T.K. the infection originated six years ago from Meicoomon. Using the power of their Crests, the DigiDestined travel to the rebooted Digital World where they briefly encounter Alphamon fighting Jesmon. They soon reunite with their partner Digimon, who warily befriend them despite having lost their memories. Nearby, Himekawa confronts the Digimon Emperor, who is revealed to resemble Gennai but with a black outfit. Meicoomon is seen hiding behind a bush still possessing her memories of Meiko.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 14 - 17\n| Title               = Loss\n| TranslitTitle       = S\u014dshitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u55aa\u5931\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"keep on (tri. version)\"<br />by Ai Maeda\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|2|25}}\n| AltDate             = February 1, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = As the DigiDestined try to rekindle their friendship with their Rookie level partner Digimon, they briefly come across Meicoomon, who has retained her memories despite the reboot.

Later that night, as Tai and Matt try to console Sora, they are suddenly attacked by Machinedramon, whose attack disperses the DigiDestined and Digimon across the Digital World.\n\nMeanwhile, Nishijima investigates Himekawa's secret files and remembers her desire to reboot the Digital World to revive her partner Megadramon, who was unable to recompose into a Digi-Egg. Nishijima meets Hackmon, who relays a warning from Homeostasis that King Drasil corrupted Gennai and is targeting \"Libra\": Meicoomon.\n\nAt the desert, Sora and Biyomon discover Meiko, who came to the Digital World in search of Meicoomon. When Meicoomon attacks them out of resentment, Meiko manages to placate her. Just then, they are attacked by Gennai who shows his true form after masquerading as the Digimon Emperor. He attempts to capture Meicoomon and Sora's Digivice but is thwarted by the other DigiDestined, who come to their aid. Gennai reveals that the reboot was all part of King Drasil's plan to create a new world order where humans and Digimon no longer interact with each other. He sends Machinedramon and MetalSeadramon after them.\n\nHimekawa reunites with Tapirmon, but realizes that he does not remember her. Tai, Matt and Kari manage to strengthen their bonds enough to digivolve their partners and defeat MetalSeadramon. When Sora risks her life to protect Biyomon, she digivolves into Phoenixmon and defeats Machinedramon, alongside Seraphimon and HerculesKabuterimon. Despite this, Gennai attacks Meiko which angers Meicoomon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 18 - 21\n| Title               = Coexistence\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u014dsei\n| NativeTitle         = \u5171\u751f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = {{nihongo|\"Words of Love\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30c8\u30d0|Ai Kotoba}}<br />by Ai Maeda & [[Ayumi Miyazaki]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2017|9|30}}\n| AltDate             = May 10, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = An enraged Meicoomon digivolves to Meicrackmon and leaves through a distortion. Himekawa is then briefly seen stumbling across the Digital World in search of Tapirmon. As Digimon begin materializing in the Real World, Hackmon explains to Nishijima and Professor Mochizuki that Meicoomon was born from a fragment of Apocalymon's remnant data. Meiko was meant to suppress the darkness within her partner Digimon. However, Homeostasis considers Meicoomon's unrestrained power to be an existential threat to both worlds and decides to eliminate her. Meanwhile, the DigiDestined try to survive the Digital World's attempts to expel them.\n\nThe DigiDestined manage to return to the Real World but are persecuted by the people. With Nishijima's help, the DigiDestined and their partner Digimon hide in their school to avoid the media. The DigiDestined try to console Meiko during their stay. The next day, a rampant Meicrackmon confronts Meiko near the school. Jesmon intervenes and his attack results in Meicrackmon digivolving to Raguelmon.\n\nAs the situation deteriorates, Homeostasis possesses Kari and warns the DigiDestined not to interfere. When Jesmon takes Raguelmon to the Digital World, the DigiDestined, their partner Digimon, and Nishijima pursue them. They arrive in a desert area of the Digital World, where Alphamon joins the fray. Six of the Digimon return to their In-Training forms as a result of Alphamon's attack, leaving only Omnimon, Raguelmon, Alphamon and Jesmon. In the Digital World, a distressed Himekawa is still searching for Tapirmon, but finds herself in the Dark Ocean. When she seemingly drowns, Nishijima senses this and laments his inability to save her. Meiko falls into despair and asks the DigiDestined to destroy Raguelmon. Tai resolves to carry out her wish despite the objections of the other DigiDestined. During the battle, a fissure opens causing Tai and Nishijima to fall from the cliff.\n\nIn the aftermath, Raguelmon is incapacitated near Tai's goggles. Kari becomes engulfed in corrupted digital code which causes Nyaromon to digivolve into Ophanimon Falldown Mode, creating a dark portal. As the portal opens, Ophanimon merges with Raguelmon into Ordinemon. The Real World is subsequently covered by a universal blackout, as the invading Digimon become able to move. Afterwards, the Digital World begins to swallow the Real World. Refusing to give up, Matt takes Tai's goggles and rallies his friends.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 22 - 26\n| Title               = Future\n| TranslitTitle       = Bokura no Mirai\n| NativeTitle         = \u307c\u304f\u3089\u306e\u672a\u6765\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| Aux1                = \"[[Butter-Fly (K\u014dji Wada song)|Butter-Fly (tri. version)]]\"<br />by the DigiDestined,{{efn|name=a|Ensemble featuring [[Natsuki Hanae]], [[Suzuko Mimori]], [[Yoshimasa Hosoya]], [[Mutsumi Tamura]], Hitomi Yoshida, Junya Enoki, [[Junya Ikeda]], [[Mao Ichimichi]], and [[Miho Arakawa]].}} Digimon Singers,{{efn|name=b|Ensemble featuring [[Chika Sakamoto]], Atori Shigematsu, [[Mayumi Yamaguchi]], [[Takahiro Sakurai]], Shihomi Mizowaki, [[Miwa Matsumoto]], [[Junko Takeuchi]], Yuka Tokumitsu, and Yukiko Morishita.}} Ayumi Miyazaki, Ai Maeda, and K\u014dji Wada{{efn|name=c|Episodes 22 to 25 use {{nihongo|\"Words of Love\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b3\u30c8\u30d0|Ai Kotoba}} by [[Ai Maeda (voice actress)|Ai Maeda]] & [[Ayumi Miyazaki]] as the ending theme.}}\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2018|5|5}}\n| AltDate             = September 20, 2018\n| ShortSummary        = Believing that Tai is dead, the DigiDestined return to the Real World. Meanwhile, Tai and the injured Nishijima wake up in a facility. Nishijima reveals that Davis, Ken, Yolei and Cody are in cryostasis, and were captured, after discovering King Drasil's plan. Gennai appears and stops the life support system, forcing Tai to choose between escaping with the others or saving Nishijima. After Tai enters one of the capsules, the dying Nishijima sends them back to the Real World, before the facility explodes.\n\nWith Kari still in shock and T.K. tending to her, the other DigiDestined fight Ordinemon, but are defeated. Hackmon informs them of Homeostasis' intent to reboot all digital technology in the Real World to stop Ordinemon. However, it would cripple all man-made infrastructure. Refusing to give up, Matt and the others have Meiko lure Ordinemon to the sea and confront her again but to no avail. Kari overcomes her trauma and has a vision of Gatomon inside Ordinemon, who reveals that all light resides in Meicoomon.\n\nGuided by Kari's vision, Izzy discovers that memories from all the Digimon have a backup stored inside Meicoomon, which explains why her memories are intact. Meiko unlocks the sealed memories inside Meicoomon, restoring the lost memories and extracting Gatomon from Ordinemon. The reboot of the Real World is halted by Hackmon. However, King Drasil floods Ordinemon with corrupted data. Tai rejoins the others as they reluctantly digivolve their partner Digimon. During the course of the battle, Meiko's Digivice awakens Omnimon's Merciful Mode. Omnimon destroys Ordinemon, deleting Meicoomon in the process. Gennai leaves through a digital distortion after King Drasil's plans are thwarted.\n\nWith both worlds restored, Meiko returns to [[Tottori Prefecture|Tottori]] and Homeostasis shuts down King Drasil. Izzy begins work on a gate that would allow traversal between worlds without D-3s. Three months later on Christmas Eve, Tai converses with Meiko on the phone and Agumon interrupts by declaring that they will always be friends.\n}}\n}}\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{see also|List of Digimon Adventure characters}}\nThe series features the eight {{nihongo|[[List of Digimon Adventure characters#DigiDestined|DigiDestined]]|\u9078\u3070\u308c\u3057\u5b50\u4f9b\u9054|Erabareshi Kodomotachi}}<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2015-04-15/digimon-tri-anime-human-cast-promo-broadcast-details-unveiling-on-may-6/.87142|title=Digimon tri.
