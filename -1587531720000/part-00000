According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a ''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'' in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} The police reportedly set up a \"collaborationist civilian town council\" led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939.

According to various accounts, Persak writes, the Germans had set up a ''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]'' in Jedwabne, staffed by eight or eleven military police.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=411\u2013412}} The police reportedly set up a \"collaborationist civilian town council\" led by a former mayor, Marian Karolak. Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. The town council is reported to have included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939.

Ignatiew. The IPN found that at least 340 Jews had been killed in the pogrom, in two groups. The first group consisted of 40 to 50 men, who were murdered before the barn was set on fire. The second group consisted of about 300 people of \"both sexes of various ages, including children and infants\". The second group was \"led into a wooden, thatched barn owned by Bronis\u0142aw \u015aleszy\u0144ski. After the building had been closed, it was doused, probably with kerosene from the former Soviet warehouse.\" The exact number of victims could not be determined. The previously estimated figure of 1,600 \"seems highly unlikely, and was not confirmed in the course of the investigation\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}\n\nThe report conclued that the perpetrators of the crime ''sensu stricto'' (\"in the strict sense\") were about 40 male \"Polish inhabitants of Jedwabne and its environs\". Responsibility for the crime ''sensu largo'' (\"in the broad sense\") could be ascribed to the Germans because of the presence of German military policemen at the Jedwabne police station. Their presence, \"though passive, was tantamount to consent to and tolerance of the crime against the Jewish inhabitants of the town\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}<ref>Hooper, John (10 July 2002). \"No trial for Poles who killed Jews in 1941\".

IPN could neither conclusively prove nor disprove these accounts. \"Witness testimonies vary considerably\" on the question of whether the Germans took the Jews to the barn or were present there.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} The IPN found that the \"Polish population\" had played a \"decisive role in the execution of the criminal plan\". The IPN wrote: \"On the basis of the evidence gathered in the investigation, it is not possible to determine the reasons for the passive behavior of the majority of the town's population in the face of the crime. In particular, it cannot be determined whether this passivity resulted from acceptance of the crime or from intimidation caused by the brutality of the perpetrators' acts.\"{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}}\n\nLeon Kieres delivered the IPN report to the Polish parliament. A small opposition party, the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) called him a \"servant of the Jews\" and blamed him and President [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]] for \"stoning the Polish nation\".

The family moved to Sydney, where Payne attended [[Sydney Grammar School]] and [[sailing|sailed]] small craft with his brother Bill and friends.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\n==Education in naval architecture and boat design==\nPayne worked at the [[Royal Australian Navy]]'s [[Cockatoo Island Dockyard]] in Sydney during [[World War II]] and meanwhile training as a [[naval architect]] at [[Sydney Technical College]], becoming in 1945 its first graduate, awarded a diploma that at the time was the highest level available.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\n==Early work==\n[[File:Payne-Mortlock Sailing Canoe2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Payne-Mortlock sailing canoe]]]]\nPayne created a private practice in naval architecture immediately after World War II, initially designing yachts and launches, then later some [[fishing trawler]]s. Payne was a crew member on ''HORIZON'' in the [[1945 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race|1945]], first [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], and several subsequent events.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" /> An early design of this period was the [[Payne-Mortlock sailing canoe]], a 5.8m design that is still raced, designed with brother Bill and friend [[Bryce Mortlock]].\n\nAt different times Payne worked alone or with just one employee, and even returned to Cockatoo Dockyard for a period in the 1950s. From about 1957 onwards he had a firm under his name and a varying number of employees. In the mid 1960s he left yacht design to work as an engineer for client Russell Slade at his [[Bonds (clothing)|Bonds clothing]] plant, but eventually returned to his first profession. He was attached for a short period to the English naval architects [[Burness, Corlett & Partners]] when they established an office in Sydney in the 1970s, and formed a partnership with [[Howard Peachey]] in the late 1980s.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\n==Significant designs==\nPayne's first designs were often in collaboration with Bryce Mortlock, and his brother Bill. Together they began designing and building their own craft, initially for the Restricted [[12 Foot Skiff]] class. The [[Payne-Mortlock sailing canoe]] was their major work, became famous, and helped bring Payne to the attention of the sailing world.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" /> He was also responsible for designing the [[Corsair (dinghy)]], a 16-foot, three-handed design as well as the 1974 [[Buccaneer 200]].\n\nPayne's first design that sailed in the Sydney to Hobart race was ''Nocturne'', a 35 foot long raised deck wooden cutter originally planned as a harbour racer, but adapted to ocean racing by the owner Bob Bull with the designer's input. It won the light weather [[1952 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] on [[line honours]]. ''Nocturne'' was a light weight yacht with a spade rudder, and the tough conditions usually encountered in ocean racing convinced Payne that it was better to design strong and seaworthy ocean racing and cruising yachts. The long keeled steel ''[[Solo (racing yacht)|Solo]]'' in [[1953 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race|1953]], the steel multi chine ''Koonya'', and the wooden Tasman Seabird Class designs in [[1959 Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race|1959]] are boats with these qualities; In 1959 the newly launched Tasman Seabird ''Cherana'' won the race, sister ship ''Kaleena'' was fifth and ''Solo'' took line honours.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\nThe ''Koonya'' design was to become a model on which many other Payne designs (and yacht lengths) were based, with the multiple [[chine]] kinks in the steel becoming almost a Payne trademark. The deep keel, sloping from the bow, with enclosed [[lead]] [[ballast]], was another Payne mark.<ref name=\"bs-ap\" />\n\nAlso during the 1950s, Payne was chief architect for [[De Havilland Marine]], an offshoot of aircraft manufacturer, [[de Havilland Australia]] that was seeking to diversify its [[aluminium]] products.\n\n===America's Cup===\nSir [[Frank Packer]] commissioned Payne to design Australia's first [[America's Cup]] challenger for the [[1962 America's Cup|1962 event]], the [[12 metre class]] ''[[Gretel (yacht)|Gretel]]''.<ref name=\"R&B_Gretel\">[http://classics.robbeberking.de/en/angebote/gretel.php Gretel], [[Robbe & Berking]] (Germany), accessed 1 January 2014</ref> The champion American design ''Vim'' was brought to Australia and studied closely.<ref name=\"R&B_Gretel\" /> Payne and his small team designed and tested over 30 models before building ''Gretel'',<ref name=\"R&B_Gretel\" /> and also designed most of the fittings and mechanical features for the new challenger. A number of the items had advanced or new features such as cross-linking the main winches ([[Winch|grinder]]s) to double the number of crew who could operate a winch. Many observers felt ''Gretel'' was as good as or better than the defender.<ref name=\"R&B_Gretel\" />\n\nPayne's second 12-metre design, ''[[Gretel II]]''<ref name=\"R&B_Gretel\" /> in [[1970 America's Cup|1970]], added to his international recognition as a leading yacht designer. His third design for [[1983 America's Cup|1983]], the aluminium ''Advance'', was hampered by a lack of funds and a decision to orient the boat to light weather conditions.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\n===Other work===\nAlan Payne continued with cruising yacht design, mainly deep keeled steel yachts. His designs were always well proportioned with a classic style that was often admired. Few stand out as unorthodox or unusual. All designs were based on good engineering and shipwright practices, and any different features were carefully considered in the design process. Plans by him or his draughtsmen were usually exceptionally well detailed and presented. These plans remain available.<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\nExemplifying his diversity, Payne also designed in wood, such as his 1966 design ''Jiemba'', a full-height motorsailer for [[Pat Clancy]], Mayor of [[Sale, Victoria|Sale]], built in [[Metung, Victoria]] by [www.bullscruisers.com.au/metung Bulls], using [[King Billy Pine]] planking over [[Spotted gum (disambiguation)|Spotted gum]] frames and decks of local [[Celery Top Pine]]. It was soon sold, but remains in good order 48 years later.<ref>[http://www.motoring.com.au/news/2012/alan-payne-46ft-motorsailer----one-mans-boat-30937 Alan Payne 46ft motorsailer -- One Man's boat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101204916/http://www.motoring.com.au/news/2012/alan-payne-46ft-motorsailer----one-mans-boat-30937 |date=1 January 2014 }}, motoring.com.au, accessed 1 January 2014</ref>\n\nIn partnership with 1945 graduate and colleague Keith Lawson at Seawork Pty Ltd, Payne developed the design for the first [[catamaran ferry]] on [[Sydney Harbour]], the ''First Fleet class''.

Later, he married Wendy Hay, and they had twin daughters, Rosetta and Sarah. Zetty carries on the career of her father having graduated as a naval architect from the [[University of New South Wales]] with a [[PhD]].<ref name=\"anmm_2013\" />\n\nPayne was also highly influential in the lives of two nephews, David (industrial designer) and Geoff (draughtsman/designer and award-winning cruising sailor), who also continued the tradition.\n\n==Recognition==\nAlan Payne was very highly respected by his peers in Australia and internationally. In the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 13 June 1993, Payne's contribution to Australian yachting was recognised with the award of a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM)<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=869651&search_type=quick&showInd=true PAYNE, Alan Newbury], \"It's an Honour\", [[Government of Australia]], accessed 27 December 2013</ref> \"for services to naval architecture as a designer of racing and cruising yachts.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Davis, Murray 1967, Australian Ocean Racing, Angus and Robertson\n*Stephensen P.R. 1962, Sydney Sails, Angus and Robertson\n*Knight, Lucia 2005, Encyclopedia of Yacht Designers, Norton\n*Wooden Boat Magazine, December 2004, article by Adrian Herbert,\n*Seacraft magazine (1945 onwards has a number of feature articles about individual designs)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131127063717/http://payneyachts.com/about_us.htm David Payne] (nephew and naval architect) - recollections\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Payne, Alan}}\n[[Category:1921 births]]\n[[Category:1995 deaths]]\n[[Category:Australian naval architects]]\n[[Category:Australian male sailors (sport)]]\n[[Category:America's Cup yacht designers]]\n[[Category:Australian yacht designers]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of Australia]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=February 2014}}\n[[File:Payne-Mortlock Sailing Canoe.jpg|thumb|right|Alan Payne (right) and Bryce Mortlock (next left) constructing a [[Payne-Mortlock sailing canoe]], late 1940s.]]\n'''Alan Newbury Payne''' [[Order of Australia|AM]] (11 December 1921, London \u2013 20 June 1995, Sydney) was a [[naval architect]]<ref name=\"anmm_2013\">[http://emuseum.anmm.gov.au/code/emuseum.asp?emu_action=advsearch&rawsearch=DisplayName/,/is/,/Alan%20Payne/,/false/,/true&moduleid=2%20&newprofile=ARHVPeople&newstyle=single Alan Payne], [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], accessed 26 December 2013</ref> born in [[England]] but who worked in [[Australia]].

Tanjung Pinang has [[ferry]] and [[Motorboat|speedboat]] connections to [[Batam]], [[Singapore]] (40&nbsp;km away), and [[Johor Bahru]].\n\nOver the centuries, Tanjung Pinang came under the control of Sumatra, Malacca, the Netherlands, Britain, and Japan.  These contacts each influenced its culture, also being a centre of Malay culture and trade traffic. In the 18th century, it was a capital of the [[Johor Sultanate|Johor\u2013Riau\u2013Lingga Empire]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe name ''Tanjung Pinang'' is taken from the position of beach nut tree that juts into the sea.{{explain|date=May 2017}} Trees that are in the Cape which is a guide for voyagers who will go to Bintan River.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} The Tanjung Pinang River is the entrance to Bintan, where the Bentan empire{{what|date=May 2017}} was based in what is now the subdivision of [[Bukit Batu]].\n\n===Early history===\nTanjung Pinang's history can be traced to the early 3rd century, when it flourished as a trading post on the India\u2013China trade route. [[Srivijaya]], a Sumatra-based empire which nurtured trade with China, came to dominate much of the Malay archipelago from the 7th to 13th centuries. It declined with the rise of piracy in the region, and by the 12th century [[Bintan Island]] became known by the Chinese as \"Pirate Island\".  \n\nAccording to the [[Malay Annals]], a Srivijaya prince named [[Sang Nila Utama|Seri Teri Buana]], fleeing from the sacking of [[Palembang]], stayed on Bintan for several years, gathering his strength before founding the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] (Singapore). A century later, it too was sacked by rival powers, and its king founded a new city at Malacca. The [[Malacca Sultanate]] (1400\u20131511) became one of the great empires of the region, its territories including the [[Riau Archipelago]]. Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, and the exiled [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mahmud Shah]] established his capital at Bintan, from which he organized attacks and blockades against the Portuguese. In 1526, after a number of attempts to suppress the Malay forces, the Portuguese razed Bintan to the ground.\n\n===Johor Sultanate===\n[[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Alauddin Riayat Shah II]], a son of Mahmud Shah, established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528. Former-Malaccan territories were quickly brought under Johor's influence, including Bintan, where an important trading port called Bandar Riau was opened. As it prospered and a war with [[Jambi]] threatened Johor in 1722, the capital was moved to Riau (now Tanjung Pinang) which became a centre of trade and Islamic studies much as Malacca had been.\n\nA conflict with the Dutch, who had taken Malacca from the Portuguese, culminated with a Dutch fleet of 13 vessels besieging and attacking Riau. On 6 January 1784, they were met in battle by Malay and [[Bugis]] forces, and repelled with the destruction of the Dutch command ship ''Malaka's Wal Faren''. Malay forces continued to harass the Dutch, and blockaded Malacca, but a defeat and succession crisis shifted power against them. The capital was moved from Riau to Lingga in 1788. The change of capitals has led to the Johor Sultanate sometimes being called the Johor\u2013Riau\u2013Lingga Empire.\n\nThe British gained control of Malacca from the Dutch in 1795. Attempting to increase their influence over the Straight of Malacca, the two powers each crowned a different candidate as Sultan of Johor\u2013Riau during a succession crisis (1812\u20131818). This led to the partition of Johor\u2013Riau under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], which placed the territory south of the straight under Dutch control as the [[Riau\u2013Lingga Sultanate]].\n\n===Dutch colony and independence===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatgezicht met de protestantse kerk en de ingang van een moskee Tandjong Pinang TMnr 10015181.jpg|thumb|left|Street view with a Protestant church and the entrance of a mosque, c.1910]]\nThe Malay were not consulted in these agreements, and relations worsened. On 11 February 1911, the Dutch deposed the sultan for defying the colonial masters, and officially annexed the sultanate which was then administered from Tanjung Pinang as the [[Riau Residency]] of the Dutch East Indies.  A military base was also constructed at Tanjung Pinang.\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupiers]] made Tanjung Pinang the government centre for the Riau Islands.  Control returned to the Dutch following the Japanese surrender, and the Dutch officially withdrew in 1950. Riau became one of the last territories merged into [[Indonesia]], known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions).

Tanjung Pinang has [[ferry]] and [[Motorboat|speedboat]] connections to [[Batam]], [[Singapore]] (40&nbsp;km away), and [[Johor Bahru]].\n\nOver the centuries, Tanjung Pinang came under the control of Sumatra, Malacca, the Netherlands, Britain, and Japan.  These contacts each influenced its culture, also being a centre of Malay culture and trade traffic. In the 18th century, it was a capital of the [[Johor Sultanate|Johor\u2013Riau\u2013Lingga Empire]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe name ''Tanjung Pinang'' is taken from the position of beach nut tree that juts into the sea.{{explain|date=May 2017}} Trees that are in the Cape which is a guide for voyagers who will go to Bintan River.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} The Tanjung Pinang River is the entrance to Bintan, where the Bentan empire{{what|date=May 2017}} was based in what is now the subdivision of [[Bukit Batu]].\n\n===Early history===\nTanjung Pinang's history can be traced to the early 3rd century, when it flourished as a trading post on the India\u2013China trade route. [[Srivijaya]], a Sumatra-based empire which nurtured trade with China, came to dominate much of the Malay archipelago from the 7th to 13th centuries. It declined with the rise of piracy in the region, and by the 12th century [[Bintan Island]] became known by the Chinese as \"Pirate Island\".  \n\nAccording to the [[Malay Annals]], a Srivijaya prince named [[Sang Nila Utama|Seri Teri Buana]], fleeing from the sacking of [[Palembang]], stayed on Bintan for several years, gathering his strength before founding the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] (Singapore). A century later, it too was sacked by rival powers, and its king founded a new city at Malacca. The [[Malacca Sultanate]] (1400\u20131511) became one of the great empires of the region, its territories including the [[Riau Archipelago]]. Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, and the exiled [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mahmud Shah]] established his capital at Bintan, from which he organized attacks and blockades against the Portuguese. In 1526, after a number of attempts to suppress the Malay forces, the Portuguese razed Bintan to the ground.\n\n===Johor Sultanate===\n[[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Alauddin Riayat Shah II]], a son of Mahmud Shah, established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528. Former-Malaccan territories were quickly brought under Johor's influence, including Bintan, where an important trading port called Bandar Riau was opened. As it prospered and a war with [[Jambi]] threatened Johor in 1722, the capital was moved to Riau (now Tanjung Pinang) which became a centre of trade and Islamic studies much as Malacca had been.\n\nA conflict with the Dutch, who had taken Malacca from the Portuguese, culminated with a Dutch fleet of 13 vessels besieging and attacking Riau. On 6 January 1784, they were met in battle by Malay and [[Bugis]] forces, and repelled with the destruction of the Dutch command ship ''Malaka's Wal Faren''. Malay forces continued to harass the Dutch, and blockaded Malacca, but a defeat and succession crisis shifted power against them. The capital was moved from Riau to Lingga in 1788. The change of capitals has led to the Johor Sultanate sometimes being called the Johor\u2013Riau\u2013Lingga Empire.\n\nThe British gained control of Malacca from the Dutch in 1795. Attempting to increase their influence over the Straight of Malacca, the two powers each crowned a different candidate as Sultan of Johor\u2013Riau during a succession crisis (1812\u20131818). This led to the partition of Johor\u2013Riau under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], which placed the territory south of the straight under Dutch control as the [[Riau\u2013Lingga Sultanate]].\n\n===Dutch colony and independence===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatgezicht met de protestantse kerk en de ingang van een moskee Tandjong Pinang TMnr 10015181.jpg|thumb|left|Street view with a Protestant church and the entrance of a mosque, c.1910]]\nThe Malay were not consulted in these agreements, and relations worsened. On 11 February 1911, the Dutch deposed the sultan for defying the colonial masters, and officially annexed the sultanate which was then administered from Tanjung Pinang as the [[Riau Residency]] of the Dutch East Indies.  A military base was also constructed at Tanjung Pinang.\n\nDuring World War II, the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupiers]] made Tanjung Pinang the government centre for the Riau Islands.  Control returned to the Dutch following the Japanese surrender, and the Dutch officially withdrew in 1950. Riau became one of the last territories merged into [[Indonesia]], known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions). Tanjung Pinang briefly became the capital of [[Riau Province]], until the capital was moved to [[Pekanbaru]] in 1960. A law passed in 2001 defined Tanjung Pinang as an autonomous city, and it became the capital of Riau Islands Province.\n\n\u00f7==Administration==\nThe city (which is administratively separate from [[Bintan Regency]]) is divided into four [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and 2010 Census population:<ref name=\"Statistik\">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!
