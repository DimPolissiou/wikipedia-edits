In 1955, [[Wallace Groves]], a [[Virginia]]n financier with lumber interests in [[Grand Bahama]], was granted {{convert|50000|acres|ha|order=flip}} of [[Bahamian pineyards|pineyard]] with substantial areas of [[swamp]] and scrubland by the [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] government with a mandate to economically develop the area. Freeport has grown to become the second most populous city in the Bahamas.\n\nThe main airport serving the city is the [[Grand Bahama International Airport]], which receives domestic flights from various islands of the Bahamas as well as several international flights from the United States and Canada. Freeport is also served by domestic Bahamian ferry services to other islands.\n\nThe [[Grand Bahama Port Authority]] (GBPA) operates the free trade zone, under the [[Hawksbill Creek Agreement]] signed in August 1955 whereby the Bahamian government agreed that businesses in the Freeport area would pay no taxes before 1980, later extended to 2054.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blount|first=Steve|title=Freeport, Bahamas|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/experience/cruise/destinations/bahamas/2013/07/01/freeport-bahamas-port-guide/2455245/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> The area of the land grants within which the Hawksbill Creek Agreement applies has been increased to {{convert|138000|acres|ha|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web| first=| last=| title=Freeport Grand Bahama | work=Government of the Bahamas| date= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640195/West-Indies}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFreeport is a {{convert|230|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} free trade zone on Grand Bahama Island, established in 1955 by the government of The Bahamas. The city of Freeport emerged from a land grant comprising {{convert|50000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of swamp and scrub to become a cosmopolitan centre.\nThe [[Grand Bahama Port Authority]] (GBPA) operates the free trade zone, under special powers conferred by the government under the Hawksbill Creek Agreement,<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Freeport, Grand Bahama Island|url=http://the-bahamas.net/the-islands/freeport-bahamas/|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> which was recently{{when|date=September 2019}} extended until August 3, 2054. The agreement also increased the land grants to {{convert|138000|acre|ha|order=flip}}.\n\nThe city was severely impacted by [[Hurricane Dorian]], with damage still being assessed as of 12 September, 2019.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/sep/02/hurricane-dorian-category-5-storm-bahamas-florida-south-north-carolina-updates</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nFreeport is located just {{convert|73|mi|km|order=flip}} off the coast of [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and on the major EW\u2013NS [[shipping route]]s. This has positioned it as an ideal centre for international business. Consequently, a growing number of international companies use Freeport for a business site.\n\n===National parks===\nParks include the Rand Nature Centre, named after its founder James Rand; Petersons Cay, a small isle about 300 yards off the shore of Grand Bahama; and the Lucayan National Park founded by Peter Barratt, a former architect and town planner of Freeport. The Lucayan National Park is {{convert|40|acre|ha|order=flip}} in extent and includes five ecological zones stretching from the south shore to the pineyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Parks of The Bahamas|url=http://www.bnt.bs/The-National-Parks-of-The-Bahamas/Lucayan-National-Park|publisher=Bnt.bs|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>  There is an extensive underwater cave system beneath the park. One cave entrance is accessible by stairs at the national park, while other caves are accessible for certified [[scuba diving|scubas]].\n\n==Climate==\nFreeport features a [[tropical rainforest climate]], similar to South Florida's. According to [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] (''Af''), more specifically with hot humid conditions that vary only a little throughout the year. Seldom do temperatures drop below {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}. Average temperatures are around {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, with water temperature varying between {{convert|72|to|78|F|C|order=flip}}. The winters are usually mild and dry (with the exception of some rainfall due to [[cold front]]s), while the summers are usually hot and wet. Although a freeze has never been reported in the Bahamas, snow was reported to have mixed with rain in Freeport in January 1977, the same time that it snowed in the [[Miami]] area. The temperature was about {{convert|4.5|\u00b0C|1}} at the time.<ref>^ Walker, N. D., Roberts, H. H., Rouse, L. J. and Huh, O. K. (1981, November 5).

In early September 2019, [[Hurricane Dorian]] moved over the area and stalled for over a day, causing extensive devastation. Several cruise ships stop weekly at the island. Much of the tourist industry is centered on the seaside suburb of [[Lucaya, Bahamas|Lucaya]], owing its name to the pre-Columbian [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] inhabitants of the island evidence of whom has been found on the island. Freeport features at least two [[Junkanoo]] festivals near New Year's.\n\nThe city is often promoted as Freeport/Lucaya. Most hotels on the island are located along the southern shore facing the Northwest Providence Channel. Primary shopping venues for tourists include the International Bazaar near downtown Freeport and the Port Lucaya Market Place in Lucaya. Recovery from the 2004 hurricanes took nearly a decade.\n\n==Notable natives and residents==\n* [[Janine Antoni]] - conceptual artist\n* [[Robert Antoni]] - novelist, professor\n* [[Sebastian Bach]] - Canadian singer, frontman of the band Skid Row\n* [[Andre Deveaux]] - NHL player\n* [[Kevin Foxx]] -  comedian/writer\n* [[Tynia Gaither]] - sprint Olympian\n* [[Jeffery Gibson]] - 400mH world champ medalist & Olympian\n* [[Shavez Hart]] - sprint Olympian\n* [[Jack Hayward]] - British businessman\n* [[Raymond Higgs]] - Olympian Jumper\n* [[Buddy Hield]] - NBA player\n* [[Jonquel Jones]] - WNBA player\n* [[Johnny Kemp]]- Singer/Songwriter\n* [[Justin Hill (writer)|Justin Hill]] - British writer\n* [[Michael Mathieu]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Demetrius Pinder]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Mate Pavic]] - Croatian professional tennis player \n* [[Vasek Pospisil]] - Canadian professional tennis player \n* [[Magnum Rolle]] - NBA Player\n* [[Alonzo Russell]] - sprint Olympian medalist\n* [[Nivea Smith]] - Sprint athlete\n* [[Teray Smith]] - Sprint Olympian\n* [[Donald Thomas (athlete)|Donald Thomas]] - high jump world champion and Olympian\n* [[Andrae Williams]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Latoy Williams]] - sprint athlete\n* [[Chavez Young]] - baseball player\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:TheInternationalBazaarEntrance.JPG|The International Bazaar\nFile:PortLucayaMarketplaceEntrance.jpg|Port Lucaya Marketplace\nFile:TheGardenOfTheGrovesEntrance.JPG|The Garden of the Groves\nFile:TheGardenOfTheGrovesBridge.JPG|Bridge in the Garden of the Groves\nFile:TainoBeachFreeportBahamas.JPG|Seagulls at Taino Beach\nFile:TainoBeachFreeport.JPG|Taino Beach\nFile:LucayanNationalParkBoardwalk.JPG|Boardwalk at Lucayan National Park\nFile:LucayanNationalParkWater.JPG|Lucayan National Park\nFile:GrandBahamaHighway.JPG|Grand Bahama Highway\nFile:BananaBayKitesurf.JPG|Kitesurf at Banana Bay\nFile:Freeport Harbor.agr.jpg|Freeport Harbor\nFile:Freeport_Cruise_Ship_Terminal.jpg|Freeport Cruise Ship Terminal\nFile:Freeport_Cruise_Terminal_Shops.jpg|Freeport Cruise Terminal Shops\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mary Star of the Sea Church, Freeport]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Barratt, Peter.

[[List of cities in the Bahamas|city]], [[Local government in the Bahamas|district]] and [[free trade zone]] on the island of [[Grand Bahama]] of the northwest [[Bahamas]]. In 1955, [[Wallace Groves]], a [[Virginia]]n financier with lumber interests in [[Grand Bahama]], was granted {{convert|50000|acres|ha|order=flip}} of [[Bahamian pineyards|pineyard]] with substantial areas of [[swamp]] and scrubland by the [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] government with a mandate to economically develop the area. Freeport has grown to become the second most populous city in the Bahamas.\n\nThe main airport serving the city is the [[Grand Bahama International Airport]], which receives domestic flights from various islands of the Bahamas as well as several international flights from the United States and Canada. Freeport is also served by domestic Bahamian ferry services to other islands.\n\nThe [[Grand Bahama Port Authority]] (GBPA) operates the free trade zone, under the [[Hawksbill Creek Agreement]] signed in August 1955 whereby the Bahamian government agreed that businesses in the Freeport area would pay no taxes before 1980, later extended to 2054.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blount|first=Steve|title=Freeport, Bahamas|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/experience/cruise/destinations/bahamas/2013/07/01/freeport-bahamas-port-guide/2455245/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> The area of the land grants within which the Hawksbill Creek Agreement applies has been increased to {{convert|138000|acres|ha|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"A\">{{cite web| first=| last=| title=Freeport Grand Bahama | work=Government of the Bahamas| date= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/640195/West-Indies}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFreeport is a {{convert|230|sqmi|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} free trade zone on Grand Bahama Island, established in 1955 by the government of The Bahamas. The city of Freeport emerged from a land grant comprising {{convert|50000|acre|ha|order=flip}} of swamp and scrub to become a cosmopolitan centre.\nThe [[Grand Bahama Port Authority]] (GBPA) operates the free trade zone, under special powers conferred by the government under the Hawksbill Creek Agreement,<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Freeport, Grand Bahama Island|url=http://the-bahamas.net/the-islands/freeport-bahamas/|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> which was recently{{when|date=September 2019}} extended until August 3, 2054. The agreement also increased the land grants to {{convert|138000|acre|ha|order=flip}}.\n\nThe city was severely impacted by [[Hurricane Dorian]], with damage still being assessed as of 12 September, 2019.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2019/sep/02/hurricane-dorian-category-5-storm-bahamas-florida-south-north-carolina-updates</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nFreeport is located just {{convert|73|mi|km|order=flip}} off the coast of [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and on the major EW\u2013NS [[shipping route]]s. This has positioned it as an ideal centre for international business. Consequently, a growing number of international companies use Freeport for a business site.\n\n===National parks===\nParks include the Rand Nature Centre, named after its founder James Rand; Petersons Cay, a small isle about 300 yards off the shore of Grand Bahama; and the Lucayan National Park founded by Peter Barratt, a former architect and town planner of Freeport. The Lucayan National Park is {{convert|40|acre|ha|order=flip}} in extent and includes five ecological zones stretching from the south shore to the pineyard.<ref>{{cite web|title=The National Parks of The Bahamas|url=http://www.bnt.bs/The-National-Parks-of-The-Bahamas/Lucayan-National-Park|publisher=Bnt.bs|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>  There is an extensive underwater cave system beneath the park. One cave entrance is accessible by stairs at the national park, while other caves are accessible for certified [[scuba diving|scubas]].\n\n==Climate==\nFreeport features a [[tropical rainforest climate]], similar to South Florida's. According to [[K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification]] (''Af''), more specifically with hot humid conditions that vary only a little throughout the year. Seldom do temperatures drop below {{convert|60|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}. Average temperatures are around {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, with water temperature varying between {{convert|72|to|78|F|C|order=flip}}. The winters are usually mild and dry (with the exception of some rainfall due to [[cold front]]s), while the summers are usually hot and wet. Although a freeze has never been reported in the Bahamas, snow was reported to have mixed with rain in Freeport in January 1977, the same time that it snowed in the [[Miami]] area. The temperature was about {{convert|4.5|\u00b0C|1}} at the time.<ref>^ Walker, N. D., Roberts, H. H., Rouse, L. J. and Huh, O. K. (1981, November 5).

In early September 2019, [[Hurricane Dorian]] moved over the area and stalled for over a day, causing extensive devastation. Several cruise ships stop weekly at the island. Much of the tourist industry is centered on the seaside suburb of [[Lucaya, Bahamas|Lucaya]], owing its name to the pre-Columbian [[Lucayan people|Lucayan]] inhabitants of the island evidence of whom has been found on the island. Freeport features at least two [[Junkanoo]] festivals near New Year's.\n\nThe city is often promoted as Freeport/Lucaya. Most hotels on the island are located along the southern shore facing the Northwest Providence Channel. Primary shopping venues for tourists include the International Bazaar near downtown Freeport and the Port Lucaya Market Place in Lucaya. Recovery from the 2004 hurricanes took nearly a decade.\n\n==Notable natives and residents==\n* [[Janine Antoni]] - conceptual artist\n* [[Robert Antoni]] - novelist, professor\n* [[Sebastian Bach]] - Canadian singer, frontman of the band Skid Row\n* [[Andre Deveaux]] - NHL player\n* [[Kevin Foxx]] -  comedian/writer\n* [[Tynia Gaither]] - sprint Olympian\n* [[Jeffery Gibson]] - 400mH world champ medalist & Olympian\n* [[Shavez Hart]] - sprint Olympian\n* [[Jack Hayward]] - British businessman\n* [[Raymond Higgs]] - Olympian Jumper\n* [[Buddy Hield]] - NBA player\n* [[Jonquel Jones]] - WNBA player\n* [[Johnny Kemp]]- Singer/Songwriter\n* [[Justin Hill (writer)|Justin Hill]] - British writer\n* [[Michael Mathieu]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Demetrius Pinder]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Mate Pavic]] - Croatian professional tennis player \n* [[Vasek Pospisil]] - Canadian professional tennis player \n* [[Magnum Rolle]] - NBA Player\n* [[Alonzo Russell]] - sprint Olympian medalist\n* [[Nivea Smith]] - Sprint athlete\n* [[Teray Smith]] - Sprint Olympian\n* [[Donald Thomas (athlete)|Donald Thomas]] - high jump world champion and Olympian\n* [[Andrae Williams]] - sprint Olympic medalist\n* [[Latoy Williams]] - sprint athlete\n* [[Chavez Young]] - baseball player\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:TheInternationalBazaarEntrance.JPG|The International Bazaar\nFile:PortLucayaMarketplaceEntrance.jpg|Port Lucaya Marketplace\nFile:TheGardenOfTheGrovesEntrance.JPG|The Garden of the Groves\nFile:TheGardenOfTheGrovesBridge.JPG|Bridge in the Garden of the Groves\nFile:TainoBeachFreeportBahamas.JPG|Seagulls at Taino Beach\nFile:TainoBeachFreeport.JPG|Taino Beach\nFile:LucayanNationalParkBoardwalk.JPG|Boardwalk at Lucayan National Park\nFile:LucayanNationalParkWater.JPG|Lucayan National Park\nFile:GrandBahamaHighway.JPG|Grand Bahama Highway\nFile:BananaBayKitesurf.JPG|Kitesurf at Banana Bay\nFile:Freeport Harbor.agr.jpg|Freeport Harbor\nFile:Freeport_Cruise_Ship_Terminal.jpg|Freeport Cruise Ship Terminal\nFile:Freeport_Cruise_Terminal_Shops.jpg|Freeport Cruise Terminal Shops\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mary Star of the Sea Church, Freeport]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Barratt, Peter.
