A French army of 50,000 commanded by [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] defeated a slightly larger [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Army]] {{efn|Supporters of the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction were generally known as the Pragmatic Allies}} of 52,000, led by the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nDespite setbacks elsewhere, at the end of 1744 the French held the initiative in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and their leaders considered this theatre offered the best opportunity for a decisive victory. In late April, they besieged Tournai, which controlled access to the upper [[Scheldt]] basin; this made it a vital link in the North European trading network and the Allies marched to its relief.\n\nLeaving 22,000 men in front of Tournai, Saxe placed his main force {{convert|8|km|mi|adj=on}} away in the villages of St Antoine, Vezin and Fontenoy, along a naturally strong feature which he strengthened with defensive works. After a series of unsuccessful flank assaults, the Allies attacked the French centre with a column of 15,000 men, which nearly succeeded in breaking through before being repulsed.\n\nAlthough the Allies retreated in good order, Tournai fell shortly afterwards, followed by [[Ghent]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Bruges]] and [[Dendermonde]]. The withdrawal of British forces in October to deal with the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]] facilitated the capture of [[Siege of Ostend (1745)|Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]; by the end of 1745, France controlled much of the Austrian Netherlands, threatening British links with Europe.\n\nHowever, by early 1746, France was struggling to finance the war and began peace talks at the [[Congress of Breda]] in May. Despite victories at [[Battle of Rocoux|Rocoux]] in October 1746 and [[Battle of Lauffeld|Lauffeld]] in July 1747, the war continued until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Locatiemaas2.GIF|thumb|left|200px|The Austrian Netherlands, with major rivers; [[Tournai]] sat on the [[Scheldt]] (top), near the border with France]]\nThe immediate cause of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was the death in 1740 of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], last male [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] in the direct line. This left his eldest daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], as heir to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], {{efn|Often referred to as 'Austria', this included [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemia]], the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and [[Parma]]}} whose  [[Salic law|laws excluded women]] from the succession. The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|1713 Pragmatic Sanction]] waived this and allowed her to inherit, but this was challenged by [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Bavaria]], the closest male heir.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|p=3}}\n\nThe dispute became a European issue because the Monarchy formed the most powerful single element in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A federation of mostly German states, it was headed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], in theory an elected position but held by the Habsburgs since 1440. In January 1742, Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in 300 years, with the support of [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Prussia]] and [[Saxony]]. Maria Theresa was backed by the so-called Pragmatic Allies, which in addition to Austria included Britain, [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].{{sfn|Black|1999|p=82}}\n\nAfter four years of war, the main winner was Prussia, which captured the Austrian province of [[Silesia]] during the 1740 to 1742 [[First Silesian War]]. As the richest province in the Empire, Silesian taxes provided 10% of total Imperial income and contained large mining, weaving and dyeing industries. Regaining it was a priority for Maria Theresa and led to the 1744\u20131745 [[Second Silesian War]].{{sfn|Armour|2012|pp=99-101}}\n\nShortly after Charles died in January 1745, the Austrians over-ran Bavaria and on 15 April, defeated a combined Franco-Bavarian force at [[Battle of Pfaffenhofen|Pfaffenhofen]]. Charles' son, [[Maximilian III Joseph]], now sued for peace and supported the election of Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], as the new Emperor. With Bavaria out of the war, Austria could focus on Silesia.{{sfn|Browning|1995|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n==The 1745 Campaign in the Austrian Netherlands==\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.png|thumb|right|170px|The [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], Allied commander]]\nIn the first half of 1744, France made significant advances in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], before being forced to divert resources to meet threats elsewhere. [[Maurice de Saxe]] persuaded [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] this was the best place to inflict a decisive defeat on Britain, whose military and financial resources were central to the Allied war effort. His plan for 1745 was to bring the Pragmatic Army to battle on a ground of his choosing, before they could establish numerical superiority.{{sfn|McNally|2017|p=6}}\n\nThe Austrian Netherlands, often referred to as [[Flanders]], was a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, dominated by rivers running east to west. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, commercial goods were largely transported by water and wars in this theatre were fought for control of major waterways, including the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|2013|pp=32\u201333}}  The most important was the River [[Scheldt]] (see Map), which began in Northern France and ran for {{convert|350|km|mi|adj=on}} before entering the [[North Sea]] at [[Antwerp]]. Saxe planned to attack [[Tournai]], a town close to the French border that controlled access to the upper Scheldt basin; this made it a vital link in the trading network for Northern Europe and the Allies would be compelled to fight for it.{{sfn|White|1962|p=149}}\n\nIn March 1745, [[George Wade]] was replaced as Allied commander in Flanders by the 24-year-old [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], advised by the experienced [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]]. In addition to British and Hanoverian troops, the Pragmatic Army included a large Dutch contingent, commanded by [[Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Prince Waldeck]], with a small number of Austrians, led by [[Dominik von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Count K\u00f6nigsegg]].{{sfn|Townshend|2015|pp=51\u201352}}{{efn|Estimated 22,000 Dutch, 21,000 British, 8,000 Hanoverian and 2,000 Austrian.{{sfn|Townshend|2015|pp=51\u201352}}}} Cumberland's inexperience was magnified by his tendency to ignore advice and internal divisions; Flanders was not a military priority for Austria, Waldeck was unpopular with his subordinates, who often disputed his orders, while the British resented and mistrusted the Hanoverians.{{sfn|McNally|2017|pp=12}}\n\nOn 21 April, a French cavalry detachment under [[Louis Charles C\u00e9sar Le Tellier, duc d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]] feinted towards [[Mons]] and Cumberland prepared to march to its relief.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=207}} Although it soon became clear this was a diversion, French intentions remained unclear until the siege of Tournai began on 28 April.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|p=141}} This uncertainty, combined with intelligence estimates that Saxe had only 30,000 men, meant the Allies failed to reinforce their field army with garrison troops; the 8,000 men at [[Namur]] and [[Charleroi]] could have changed the result of the battle.{{sfn|McNally|2017|pp=14}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Map of the Battle of Fontenoy 1745.png|thumb|left|Battle map; French (blue), line running from St Antoine (bottom right) to the Bois de Barry (top left), with the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' and ''Redoubt de Chambonas'']]\nAfter confirming the Allies were approaching from the south-east, Saxe left 22,000 men to continue the siege and placed his main force around the villages of Fontenoy and St Antoine, {{convert|8|km|mi|adj=on}} from Tournai.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} As the French infantry were considered inferior in training and discipline to their opponents, where possible Saxe placed them behind defensive works or [[redoubt]]s and fortified the villages.{{sfn|Chandler|1990|p=105}}\n\nHis main defensive line ran along the crest of a plateau, the right resting on the Scheldt, Fontenoy in the centre and the ''Bois de Barry'' on his left, supported by the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' and ''Redoubt de Chambonas''. The ground in front of Fontenoy sloped down to the small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of Vezin and Bourgeon (see Battle map). Known as the ''Chemin de Mons'', this meant a direct attack on the French centre would be exposed to prolonged fire from in front and [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from the flanks.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|p=174}}  \n\nThe Allies made contact with French outposts on the evening of 9 May but a hasty reconnaissance by Cumberland and his staff failed to identify the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. Next day, British and Hanoverian cavalry under [[James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1745)|James Campbell]] pushed the French out of Vezin and Bourgeon. Campbell's deputy, the [[John Lindsay, 20th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]], recommended infantry clear the ''Bois de Barry'', while the cavalry swung around the wood to outflank the French left. Dutch [[hussar]]s were sent to reconnoitre the route but withdrew when fired on by French troops in the wood, and the plan abandoned.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=50}} The attack was postponed until the following day, both armies camping overnight on their positions.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|p=178}}\n\nAt 4:00 am on 11 May, the Allies formed up, British and Hanoverians on the right and centre, Dutch on the left and Austrians in reserve. The Dutch were tasked with taking Fontenoy and St Antoine, while an independent [[brigade]] under [[Richard Ingoldsby (British Army officer, died 1759)|Richard Ingoldsby]] captured the ''Redoubt de Chambonas'' and cleared the ''Bois de Barry''. Once both flanks were engaged, massed Allied infantry in the centre under Ligonier would advance up the slope and dislodge the main French army.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=149\u2013150, 158\u2013159}}\n\nBecause Cumberland estimated French numbers as no more than 30,000, he assumed their main force was in the centre and failed to appreciate the strength of the flanking positions. As he moved forward, Ingoldsby ran into the ''Redoubt d'Eu''; only now did the real strength of the French left become apparent and he requested artillery support. The advance halted until the redoubt was taken, while his men skirmished with light troops in the woods, known as ''Harquebusiers de Grassins''.{{sfn|Mcintyre|2016|p=190}} These numbered no more than 900 but uncertain of their strength, Ingoldsby hesitated; given the earlier failure to detect the redoubt, his caution was understandable but delayed the main attack.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises]] and [[Grenadier Guards]] invite each other to fire first.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1883|p=368}}]]\nThe Allied cavalry had been positioned in front of Vezin to screen Ligonier's infantry column as they formed up, exposing them to fire from cannon in the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. One shot fatally wounded Campbell around 6:30 am; Crawford assumed command and the cavalry withdrew behind Vezin, where they spent most of the battle.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=210}} The Dutch forces had lined up and were ready to advance, but to the dismay of Waldeck, the British and Hannoveran infantry was still forming up. The Allied artillery opened fire in the early hours on the French positions around Fontenoy. However, since the Allied army had no heavy 12- en 24 pounder guns, the bombardment had little effect on the French, who had dug themselves in. At 7:00 am, Cumberland became impatient at the lack of progress and ordered Ingoldsby to advance with the main column, rather than storming the redoubt but failed to inform Ligonier. The Dutch finally received the order to attack on Fontenoy and St Antoine. The Dutch advanced unhindred, but once they reached the French lines, they came under heavy fire, among others from French infantry positioned in the walled cemetery of Fontenoy, and they were repulsed with heavy losses. At 9:00 am, Ligonier sent an aide instructing Ingoldsby to attack the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' immediately. When Ingoldsby shared his new orders from Cumberland, Ligonier was apparently horrified.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=53}} \n\nAt 10:30, the Dutch attacked Fontenoy a second time, supported by the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Foot]]; after some initial success, they were thrown back and at 12:30 pm. Cumberland ordered the central column to move forward.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=168}} This is generally agreed to have contained some 15,000 men, deployed in two lines.{{efn|From right to left, the first line contained the [[Grenadier Guards|Grenadier]], [[Scots Guards|Scots]] and [[Coldstream Guards]], [[Royal Scots]], Scots Fusiliers, [[31st Foot]]), [[8th Foot]], [[25th Foot]], [[33rd Foot]] and [[19th Foot]]. The second line; [[3rd Foot]], [[23rd]], [[32nd Foot]], [[11th Foot]], [[28th Foot]], [[34th Foot]] and [[20th Foot]]. The Hanoverian regiments were on the extreme left.}} Led by Cumberland and Ligonier, the infantry advanced up the slope, pausing at intervals to redress their lines and despite heavy casualties, retained formation as they reached the crest. It was at this point [[Lord Charles Hay]] of the Grenadier Guards apparently invited the [[Gardes Fran\u00e7aises]] to 'stand and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen'.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=206}}\n\nThis goaded the ''Gardes Fran\u00e7aises'' into leaving their defensive positions and firing prematurely, greatly reducing the impact of their first volley, while that of the British killed or wounded 700 to 800 men. The French front line broke up in confusion; many of their reserves had been transferred to support Fontenoy earlier in the day and the Allied column now advanced into this gap.{{sfn|Starkey|2003|p=120}} From their position near Notre Dame de Bois, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], his son the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (son of Louis XV)|Dauphin]], [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles|Noailles]] and [[Armand de Vignerot du Plessis|Richelieu]] saw their forces fall back in disorder. Noailles implored Louis to seek safety but Saxe assured him the battle was not lost and his deputy [[Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar von L\u00f6wendal|L\u00f6wendal]] ordered a series of cavalry attacks, which succeeded in forcing the Allies back.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=211}}\n\nWith Cumberland isolated from the battle, no attempt was made to relieve pressure on Allied centre by ordering attacks on Fontenoy or the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. Under fire from both flanks and in front, the column now formed a hollow, three sided square, reducing their firepower advantage.{{sfn|Chandler|1990|p=126}} Although poorly co-ordinated, the French cavalry charges allowed their infantry to reform and at 14:00, Saxe brought up his remaining artillery to fire into the Allied infantry at close range. This was followed by a general assault, led by the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]], with the cry: Cuimhnigidh ar Liumneac, agus ar fheile na Sacsanach-Remember Limerick and British faith, who lost 656 men wounded or killed, including one-quarter of their officers, including, Colonel [[James Dillon]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}.{{sfn|McGarry|2014|p=99}}{{efn|\"The encounter between the British and Irish Brigade was fierce, the fire constant, and the slaughter great; but the loss on the side of the British was such, they were at length compelled to retire\".{{sfn|Townshend|2015|p=66}}}}\nWhen King George II heard of the loss he was quoted as saying (of the Irish) \"Cursed be the laws that deprive me of such subjects.\"\n{{sfn|www.theirishstory.com}} McGarry, in his book entitled ''Irish Brigades Abroad'', identifies the Irish Brigade having captured a flag from Sempill's Regiment of Foot, the forerunner of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]].\n\nLed by Saxe and L\u00f6wendahl, the ''Gardes Fran\u00e7aises'' attacked once more, while D'Estr\u00e9es and Richelieu brought up the elite [[Maison militaire du roi de France|Maison du roi]] cavalry.

French losses were between 7,000 and 8,000 killed and wounded, the Allies 10,000 to 12,000, including those captured after the battle. Saxe was criticised for not following up. He later explained his troops were exhausted and incapable of doing so, while the Allied cavalry remained largely intact and fresh, their infantry unbroken and many of the 22,000 Dutch had not been involved.{{sfn|White|1962|p=163}} He was also in great pain, suffering from [[edema]] or 'dropsy' and had to be carried around the battlefield in a wicker chair and had to be helped onto his horse to meet Louis after the battle.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=207}} These critics did not include Louis or [[Frederick the Great]], who viewed Fontenoy as a tactical masterpiece and invited him to [[Sanssouci]] to discuss it.{{sfn|MacDonogh|1999|p=206}}\n\nThe tenacity and discipline of the Allied infantry meant they avoided defeat but Fontenoy dispelled the notion of British military superiority held in Europe since [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]].{{sfn|Black|1998|p=33}} In contrast to Saxe, Cumberland performed poorly; he ignored advice from his more experienced subordinates, failed to follow through on clearing the ''Bois de Barry'' and gave Ingoldsby conflicting orders. Although his courage was admired, the inactivity of the Allied cavalry was partly due to his participation in the infantry attack and loss of strategic oversight.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=208}} Ligonier and other observers viewed Fontenoy as a 'defeat snatched from the jaws of victory'; understandable for a 24 year old in his first major engagement, these faults were also apparent at the [[Battle of Lauffeld]] in 1747.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=54}}\n\nIn the recriminations that followed, the Dutch received much of the blame in English accounts for not relieving pressure on the centre by attacking Fontenoy.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|pp=178\u2013179}} This was also noted by Cavalry commander general Schlippenbach, who later covered the retreat of the Dutch infantry with his dragoons. The Hesse-Homburg cavalry regiment which was also under his command, turned and fled after the first shots had been fired. Its commander, Colonel Heiko Appius, fled back ahead of his regiment, and wrote a letter to the States General that \"the army was destroyed\" and that its \"woefull remnants\" had been plundered by French hussars. After an inquiry, Appius and several other officers admitted they had panicked and were dishonourably discharged. Appius, declared unfit to serve the Republic, would later return to Groningen, where he would publish an apology, stating he had not fled but tried to rally his regiment two times. He was however condemned to recall this paper, and it was publicly burned by the hangman in The Hague{{sfn|Nimwegen|2002|pp=}}{{sfn|Geerdink-Schaftenaar|2018|pp=}}. The reputation of the Dutch army was severely tarnished, and Cumberland would never trust the Dutch forces again. Ingolsby was [[court-martial]]led for failing to attack the Redoubt d'Eu, although his claim to have received inconsistent orders was supported by the evidence. He was wounded, while two regiments of his brigade, the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th Foot]] and B\u00f6selager's Hanoverian Foot, suffered the largest casualties of the units involved. The court concluded his failure arose 'from an error of judgement, and not from want of courage' but he was forced out of the army.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=233}}\n\nWith no hope of relief, Tournai surrendered on 20 June; by early September, the French controlled most of the Austrian Netherlands, including the vital ports of [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuport]].{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=219}} Saxe continued his advance in 1746 after the British diverted resources to deal with the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].

A French army of 50,000 commanded by [[Maurice, comte de Saxe|Marshal Saxe]] defeated a slightly larger [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Army]] {{efn|Supporters of the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction were generally known as the Pragmatic Allies}} of 52,000, led by the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]].\n\nDespite setbacks elsewhere, at the end of 1744 the French held the initiative in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and their leaders considered this theatre offered the best opportunity for a decisive victory. In late April, they besieged Tournai, which controlled access to the upper [[Scheldt]] basin; this made it a vital link in the North European trading network and the Allies marched to its relief.\n\nLeaving 22,000 men in front of Tournai, Saxe placed his main force {{convert|8|km|mi|adj=on}} away in the villages of St Antoine, Vezin and Fontenoy, along a naturally strong feature which he strengthened with defensive works. After a series of unsuccessful flank assaults, the Allies attacked the French centre with a column of 15,000 men, which nearly succeeded in breaking through before being repulsed.\n\nAlthough the Allies retreated in good order, Tournai fell shortly afterwards, followed by [[Ghent]], [[Oudenaarde]], [[Bruges]] and [[Dendermonde]]. The withdrawal of British forces in October to deal with the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite Rising]] facilitated the capture of [[Siege of Ostend (1745)|Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]]; by the end of 1745, France controlled much of the Austrian Netherlands, threatening British links with Europe.\n\nHowever, by early 1746, France was struggling to finance the war and began peace talks at the [[Congress of Breda]] in May. Despite victories at [[Battle of Rocoux|Rocoux]] in October 1746 and [[Battle of Lauffeld|Lauffeld]] in July 1747, the war continued until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Locatiemaas2.GIF|thumb|left|200px|The Austrian Netherlands, with major rivers; [[Tournai]] sat on the [[Scheldt]] (top), near the border with France]]\nThe immediate cause of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] was the death in 1740 of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], last male [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] in the direct line. This left his eldest daughter, [[Maria Theresa]], as heir to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], {{efn|Often referred to as 'Austria', this included [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemia]], the [[Austrian Netherlands]], and [[Parma]]}} whose  [[Salic law|laws excluded women]] from the succession. The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|1713 Pragmatic Sanction]] waived this and allowed her to inherit, but this was challenged by [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Bavaria]], the closest male heir.{{sfn|Anderson|1995|p=3}}\n\nThe dispute became a European issue because the Monarchy formed the most powerful single element in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. A federation of mostly German states, it was headed by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], in theory an elected position but held by the Habsburgs since 1440. In January 1742, Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in 300 years, with the support of [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Prussia]] and [[Saxony]]. Maria Theresa was backed by the so-called Pragmatic Allies, which in addition to Austria included Britain, [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].{{sfn|Black|1999|p=82}}\n\nAfter four years of war, the main winner was Prussia, which captured the Austrian province of [[Silesia]] during the 1740 to 1742 [[First Silesian War]]. As the richest province in the Empire, Silesian taxes provided 10% of total Imperial income and contained large mining, weaving and dyeing industries. Regaining it was a priority for Maria Theresa and led to the 1744\u20131745 [[Second Silesian War]].{{sfn|Armour|2012|pp=99-101}}\n\nShortly after Charles died in January 1745, the Austrians over-ran Bavaria and on 15 April, defeated a combined Franco-Bavarian force at [[Battle of Pfaffenhofen|Pfaffenhofen]]. Charles' son, [[Maximilian III Joseph]], now sued for peace and supported the election of Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], as the new Emperor. With Bavaria out of the war, Austria could focus on Silesia.{{sfn|Browning|1995|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n==The 1745 Campaign in the Austrian Netherlands==\n[[File:William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland.png|thumb|right|170px|The [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], Allied commander]]\nIn the first half of 1744, France made significant advances in the [[Austrian Netherlands]], before being forced to divert resources to meet threats elsewhere. [[Maurice de Saxe]] persuaded [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] this was the best place to inflict a decisive defeat on Britain, whose military and financial resources were central to the Allied war effort. His plan for 1745 was to bring the Pragmatic Army to battle on a ground of his choosing, before they could establish numerical superiority.{{sfn|McNally|2017|p=6}}\n\nThe Austrian Netherlands, often referred to as [[Flanders]], was a compact area 160 kilometres wide, the highest point only 100 metres above sea level, dominated by rivers running east to west. Until the advent of railways in the 19th century, commercial goods were largely transported by water and wars in this theatre were fought for control of major waterways, including the [[Lys (river)|Lys]], [[Sambre]] and [[Meuse]].{{sfn|Childs|2013|pp=32\u201333}}  The most important was the River [[Scheldt]] (see Map), which began in Northern France and ran for {{convert|350|km|mi|adj=on}} before entering the [[North Sea]] at [[Antwerp]]. Saxe planned to attack [[Tournai]], a town close to the French border that controlled access to the upper Scheldt basin; this made it a vital link in the trading network for Northern Europe and the Allies would be compelled to fight for it.{{sfn|White|1962|p=149}}\n\nIn March 1745, [[George Wade]] was replaced as Allied commander in Flanders by the 24-year-old [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], advised by the experienced [[John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier|Earl Ligonier]]. In addition to British and Hanoverian troops, the Pragmatic Army included a large Dutch contingent, commanded by [[Karl August, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont|Prince Waldeck]], with a small number of Austrians, led by [[Dominik von K\u00f6nigsegg-Rothenfels|Count K\u00f6nigsegg]].{{sfn|Townshend|2015|pp=51\u201352}}{{efn|Estimated 22,000 Dutch, 21,000 British, 8,000 Hanoverian and 2,000 Austrian.{{sfn|Townshend|2015|pp=51\u201352}}}} Cumberland's inexperience was magnified by his tendency to ignore advice and internal divisions; Flanders was not a military priority for Austria, Waldeck was unpopular with his subordinates, who often disputed his orders, while the British resented and mistrusted the Hanoverians.{{sfn|McNally|2017|pp=12}}\n\nOn 21 April, a French cavalry detachment under [[Louis Charles C\u00e9sar Le Tellier, duc d'Estr\u00e9es|d'Estr\u00e9es]] feinted towards [[Mons]] and Cumberland prepared to march to its relief.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=207}} Although it soon became clear this was a diversion, French intentions remained unclear until the siege of Tournai began on 28 April.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|p=141}} This uncertainty, combined with intelligence estimates that Saxe had only 30,000 men, meant the Allies failed to reinforce their field army with garrison troops; the 8,000 men at [[Namur]] and [[Charleroi]] could have changed the result of the battle.{{sfn|McNally|2017|pp=14}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Map of the Battle of Fontenoy 1745.png|thumb|left|Battle map; French (blue), line running from St Antoine (bottom right) to the Bois de Barry (top left), with the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' and ''Redoubt de Chambonas'']]\nAfter confirming the Allies were approaching from the south-east, Saxe left 22,000 men to continue the siege and placed his main force around the villages of Fontenoy and St Antoine, {{convert|8|km|mi|adj=on}} from Tournai.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=151\u2013152}} As the French infantry were considered inferior in training and discipline to their opponents, where possible Saxe placed them behind defensive works or [[redoubt]]s and fortified the villages.{{sfn|Chandler|1990|p=105}}\n\nHis main defensive line ran along the crest of a plateau, the right resting on the Scheldt, Fontenoy in the centre and the ''Bois de Barry'' on his left, supported by the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' and ''Redoubt de Chambonas''. The ground in front of Fontenoy sloped down to the small [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] of Vezin and Bourgeon (see Battle map). Known as the ''Chemin de Mons'', this meant a direct attack on the French centre would be exposed to prolonged fire from in front and [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire from the flanks.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|p=174}}  \n\nThe Allies made contact with French outposts on the evening of 9 May but a hasty reconnaissance by Cumberland and his staff failed to identify the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. Next day, British and Hanoverian cavalry under [[James Campbell (British Army officer, died 1745)|James Campbell]] pushed the French out of Vezin and Bourgeon. Campbell's deputy, the [[John Lindsay, 20th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]], recommended infantry clear the ''Bois de Barry'', while the cavalry swung around the wood to outflank the French left. Dutch [[hussar]]s were sent to reconnoitre the route but withdrew when fired on by French troops in the wood, and the plan abandoned.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=50}} The attack was postponed until the following day, both armies camping overnight on their positions.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|p=178}}\n\nAt 4:00 am on 11 May, the Allies formed up, British and Hanoverians on the right and centre, Dutch on the left and Austrians in reserve. The Dutch were tasked with taking Fontenoy and St Antoine, while an independent [[brigade]] under [[Richard Ingoldsby (British Army officer, died 1759)|Richard Ingoldsby]] captured the ''Redoubt de Chambonas'' and cleared the ''Bois de Barry''. Once both flanks were engaged, massed Allied infantry in the centre under Ligonier would advance up the slope and dislodge the main French army.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=149\u2013150, 158\u2013159}}\n\nBecause Cumberland estimated French numbers as no more than 30,000, he assumed their main force was in the centre and failed to appreciate the strength of the flanking positions. As he moved forward, Ingoldsby ran into the ''Redoubt d'Eu''; only now did the real strength of the French left become apparent and he requested artillery support. The advance halted until the redoubt was taken, while his men skirmished with light troops in the woods, known as ''Harquebusiers de Grassins''.{{sfn|Mcintyre|2016|p=190}} These numbered no more than 900 but uncertain of their strength, Ingoldsby hesitated; given the earlier failure to detect the redoubt, his caution was understandable but delayed the main attack.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Battle-of-Fontenoy.jpg|thumb|The [[Gardes fran\u00e7aises]] and [[Grenadier Guards]] invite each other to fire first.{{sfn|Mackinnon|1883|p=368}}]]\nThe Allied cavalry had been positioned in front of Vezin to screen Ligonier's infantry column as they formed up, exposing them to fire from cannon in the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. One shot fatally wounded Campbell around 6:30 am; Crawford assumed command and the cavalry withdrew behind Vezin, where they spent most of the battle.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=210}} The Dutch forces had lined up and were ready to advance, but to the dismay of Waldeck, the British and Hannoveran infantry was still forming up. The Allied artillery opened fire in the early hours on the French positions around Fontenoy. However, since the Allied army had no heavy 12- en 24 pounder guns, the bombardment had little effect on the French, who had dug themselves in. At 7:00 am, Cumberland became impatient at the lack of progress and ordered Ingoldsby to advance with the main column, rather than storming the redoubt but failed to inform Ligonier. The Dutch finally received the order to attack on Fontenoy and St Antoine. The Dutch advanced unhindred, but once they reached the French lines, they came under heavy fire, among others from French infantry positioned in the walled cemetery of Fontenoy, and they were repulsed with heavy losses. At 9:00 am, Ligonier sent an aide instructing Ingoldsby to attack the ''Redoubt d'Eu'' immediately. When Ingoldsby shared his new orders from Cumberland, Ligonier was apparently horrified.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=53}} \n\nAt 10:30, the Dutch attacked Fontenoy a second time, supported by the [[42nd Regiment of Foot|42nd Foot]]; after some initial success, they were thrown back and at 12:30 pm. Cumberland ordered the central column to move forward.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=168}} This is generally agreed to have contained some 15,000 men, deployed in two lines.{{efn|From right to left, the first line contained the [[Grenadier Guards|Grenadier]], [[Scots Guards|Scots]] and [[Coldstream Guards]], [[Royal Scots]], Scots Fusiliers, [[31st Foot]]), [[8th Foot]], [[25th Foot]], [[33rd Foot]] and [[19th Foot]]. The second line; [[3rd Foot]], [[23rd]], [[32nd Foot]], [[11th Foot]], [[28th Foot]], [[34th Foot]] and [[20th Foot]]. The Hanoverian regiments were on the extreme left.}} Led by Cumberland and Ligonier, the infantry advanced up the slope, pausing at intervals to redress their lines and despite heavy casualties, retained formation as they reached the crest. It was at this point [[Lord Charles Hay]] of the Grenadier Guards apparently invited the [[Gardes Fran\u00e7aises]] to 'stand and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen'.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=206}}\n\nThis goaded the ''Gardes Fran\u00e7aises'' into leaving their defensive positions and firing prematurely, greatly reducing the impact of their first volley, while that of the British killed or wounded 700 to 800 men. The French front line broke up in confusion; many of their reserves had been transferred to support Fontenoy earlier in the day and the Allied column now advanced into this gap.{{sfn|Starkey|2003|p=120}} From their position near Notre Dame de Bois, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], his son the [[Louis, Dauphin of France (son of Louis XV)|Dauphin]], [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles|Noailles]] and [[Armand de Vignerot du Plessis|Richelieu]] saw their forces fall back in disorder. Noailles implored Louis to seek safety but Saxe assured him the battle was not lost and his deputy [[Ulrich Friedrich Woldemar von L\u00f6wendal|L\u00f6wendal]] ordered a series of cavalry attacks, which succeeded in forcing the Allies back.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=211}}\n\nWith Cumberland isolated from the battle, no attempt was made to relieve pressure on Allied centre by ordering attacks on Fontenoy or the ''Redoubt d'Eu''. Under fire from both flanks and in front, the column now formed a hollow, three sided square, reducing their firepower advantage.{{sfn|Chandler|1990|p=126}} Although poorly co-ordinated, the French cavalry charges allowed their infantry to reform and at 14:00, Saxe brought up his remaining artillery to fire into the Allied infantry at close range. This was followed by a general assault, led by the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]], with the cry: Cuimhnigidh ar Liumneac, agus ar fheile na Sacsanach-Remember Limerick and British faith, who lost 656 men wounded or killed, including one-quarter of their officers, including, Colonel [[James Dillon]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}.{{sfn|McGarry|2014|p=99}}{{efn|\"The encounter between the British and Irish Brigade was fierce, the fire constant, and the slaughter great; but the loss on the side of the British was such, they were at length compelled to retire\".{{sfn|Townshend|2015|p=66}}}}\nWhen King George II heard of the loss he was quoted as saying (of the Irish) \"Cursed be the laws that deprive me of such subjects.\"\n{{sfn|www.theirishstory.com}} McGarry, in his book entitled ''Irish Brigades Abroad'', identifies the Irish Brigade having captured a flag from Sempill's Regiment of Foot, the forerunner of the [[King's Own Scottish Borderers]].\n\nLed by Saxe and L\u00f6wendahl, the ''Gardes Fran\u00e7aises'' attacked once more, while D'Estr\u00e9es and Richelieu brought up the elite [[Maison militaire du roi de France|Maison du roi]] cavalry. The Allies were driven back with heavy losses; the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers|23rd Foot]] took 322 casualties, the three Guards regiments over 700.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=182, 190}} Despite this, discipline and training allowed them to make a fighting withdrawal, the rearguard turning at intervals to fire on their pursuers.{{sfn|Black|1998|p=67}} Once they reached Vezin, the cavalry provided cover as they moved into columns of march, before retreating to [[Ath]] with little interference from the French.{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=212}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Maurice de Saxe (1696-1750).PNG|thumb|left|upright=.75|[[Maurice de Saxe]]; despite being in severe pain, his interventions and leadership was key to French victory]]\nAlthough numbers are debated, Fontenoy incurred the highest battlefield casualties in western Europe since the [[Battle of Malplaquet]] in 1709. French losses were between 7,000 and 8,000 killed and wounded, the Allies 10,000 to 12,000, including those captured after the battle. Saxe was criticised for not following up. He later explained his troops were exhausted and incapable of doing so, while the Allied cavalry remained largely intact and fresh, their infantry unbroken and many of the 22,000 Dutch had not been involved.{{sfn|White|1962|p=163}} He was also in great pain, suffering from [[edema]] or 'dropsy' and had to be carried around the battlefield in a wicker chair and had to be helped onto his horse to meet Louis after the battle.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=207}} These critics did not include Louis or [[Frederick the Great]], who viewed Fontenoy as a tactical masterpiece and invited him to [[Sanssouci]] to discuss it.{{sfn|MacDonogh|1999|p=206}}\n\nThe tenacity and discipline of the Allied infantry meant they avoided defeat but Fontenoy dispelled the notion of British military superiority held in Europe since [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough]].{{sfn|Black|1998|p=33}} In contrast to Saxe, Cumberland performed poorly; he ignored advice from his more experienced subordinates, failed to follow through on clearing the ''Bois de Barry'' and gave Ingoldsby conflicting orders. Although his courage was admired, the inactivity of the Allied cavalry was partly due to his participation in the infantry attack and loss of strategic oversight.{{sfn|Weigley|1991|p=208}} Ligonier and other observers viewed Fontenoy as a 'defeat snatched from the jaws of victory'; understandable for a 24 year old in his first major engagement, these faults were also apparent at the [[Battle of Lauffeld]] in 1747.{{sfn|Oliphant|2015|p=54}}\n\nIn the recriminations that followed, the Dutch received much of the blame in English accounts for not relieving pressure on the centre by attacking Fontenoy.{{sfn|Charteris|2012|pp=178\u2013179}} This was also noted by Cavalry commander general Schlippenbach, who later covered the retreat of the Dutch infantry with his dragoons. The Hesse-Homburg cavalry regiment which was also under his command, turned and fled after the first shots had been fired. Its commander, Colonel Heiko Appius, fled back ahead of his regiment, and wrote a letter to the States General that \"the army was destroyed\" and that its \"woefull remnants\" had been plundered by French hussars. After an inquiry, Appius and several other officers admitted they had panicked and were dishonourably discharged. Appius, declared unfit to serve the Republic, would later return to Groningen, where he would publish an apology, stating he had not fled but tried to rally his regiment two times. He was however condemned to recall this paper, and it was publicly burned by the hangman in The Hague{{sfn|Nimwegen|2002|pp=}}{{sfn|Geerdink-Schaftenaar|2018|pp=}}. The reputation of the Dutch army was severely tarnished, and Cumberland would never trust the Dutch forces again. Ingolsby was [[court-martial]]led for failing to attack the Redoubt d'Eu, although his claim to have received inconsistent orders was supported by the evidence. He was wounded, while two regiments of his brigade, the [[Suffolk Regiment|12th Foot]] and B\u00f6selager's Hanoverian Foot, suffered the largest casualties of the units involved. The court concluded his failure arose 'from an error of judgement, and not from want of courage' but he was forced out of the army.{{sfn|Skrine|2018|pp=233}}\n\nWith no hope of relief, Tournai surrendered on 20 June; by early September, the French controlled most of the Austrian Netherlands, including the vital ports of [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuport]].{{sfn|Browning|1995|p=219}} Saxe continued his advance in 1746 after the British diverted resources to deal with the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]]. By the end of 1747, France controlled most of the Austrian Netherlands and threatened the Dutch Republic but their strategic position had declined due to the economic impact of the British naval blockade. They withdrew from the Netherlands under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] (1748); returning the territorial gains that cost so much, in exchange for so little, popularised a French phrase \"as stupid as the Peace\".{{sfn|McLynn|2008|p=1}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=M.

It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including [[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], [[Bob Beckel]], and [[Chris Matthews]], in a time slot opposite [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.\n\n===1996 presidential primaries===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996}}\n\nBuchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries.  With a Democratic President ([[Bill Clinton]]) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], who was considered to have many weaknesses.  Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of [[Texas]], former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] [[Lamar Alexander]] and the multi-millionaire publisher [[Steve Forbes]].\n\nIn February, the liberal [[Center for Public Integrity]] issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, [[Larry Pratt]], appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Union Leader]]'' he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \"to answer these charges,\" \"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Buchanan Aide Leaves Campaign Amid Charges|newspaper=[[The Union Leader]]|date=February 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February [[New Hampshire primary]], getting his campaign off to an energetic start. He was endorsed by conservative [[Phyllis Schlafly]], among others. He won three other states ([[Alaska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]]), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the [[Iowa caucus]]. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:\n{{quote|text=We shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic.

Having collected only 21% of the total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a [[pro-choice]] running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]) candidate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Porteous|first=Skipp|url=http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html|date=April 1996|title=Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan|journal=Freedom Writer|publisher=Public Eye}}</ref> Dole chose [[Jack Kemp]] and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. He also began a series of books with 1998's ''The Great Betrayal''.\n\n===2000 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000}}\n[[File:Buchanan 2000 reform.png|250px|right]]\nBuchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"[[beltway]] party.\" He sought the nomination of the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Many reformers backed [[Iowa]] physicist [[John Hagelin]], whose platform was based on [[Transcendental Meditation]].  Party founder [[Ross Perot]] did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination.  (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)\n\nSupporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\"  The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.\n\nUltimately, when the [[Federal Elections Commission]] ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], Buchanan won the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, [[Ezola B.

(Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the [[United States Natural Law Party|Natural Law]] candidate.) In [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], Buchanan received 3,407 votes{{mdash}}which some saw as inconsistent with [[Palm Beach County]]'s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \"[[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida#Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots|butterfly ballot]]\", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] stated, \"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500.  Appearing on ''The Today Show'', Buchanan said: \"When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night ... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for [[Al Gore]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/showflorida2000.php?fileid=buchanan11-09|title=Pat Buchanan on NBC's Today Show|date=November 9, 2000}}</ref>\n\nSome observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Havrilesky|first=Heather|url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|title=Not standing Pat|work=Salon|date=October 25, 1999|accessdate=June 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423233336/http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/|archive-date=April 23, 2008|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later political involvement===\nFollowing the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the [[neo-conservative]] Republican party leadership. Prior to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing: \"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values.

It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including [[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], [[Bob Beckel]], and [[Chris Matthews]], in a time slot opposite [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.\n\n===1996 presidential primaries===\n{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996}}\n\nBuchanan made another attempt to win the Republican nomination in the 1996 primaries.  With a Democratic President ([[Bill Clinton]]) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]], who was considered to have many weaknesses.  Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of [[Texas]], former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] [[Lamar Alexander]] and the multi-millionaire publisher [[Steve Forbes]].\n\nIn February, the liberal [[Center for Public Integrity]] issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, [[Larry Pratt]], appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Union Leader]]'' he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence \"to answer these charges,\" \"so as not to have distraction in the campaign.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=Buchanan Aide Leaves Campaign Amid Charges|newspaper=[[The Union Leader]]|date=February 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan defeated Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February [[New Hampshire primary]], getting his campaign off to an energetic start. He was endorsed by conservative [[Phyllis Schlafly]], among others. He won three other states ([[Alaska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]]), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the [[Iowa caucus]]. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:\n{{quote|text=We shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. All the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks.

Having collected only 21% of the total votes or 3.1 million in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared that, if Dole were to choose a [[pro-choice]] running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]) candidate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Porteous|first=Skipp|url=http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html|date=April 1996|title=Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan|journal=Freedom Writer|publisher=Public Eye}}</ref> Dole chose [[Jack Kemp]] and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. He also began a series of books with 1998's ''The Great Betrayal''.\n\n===2000 presidential campaign===\n{{Main|Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|Pat Buchanan presidential campaign, 2000}}\n[[File:Buchanan 2000 reform.png|250px|right]]\nBuchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a \"[[beltway]] party.\" He sought the nomination of the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Many reformers backed [[Iowa]] physicist [[John Hagelin]], whose platform was based on [[Transcendental Meditation]].  Party founder [[Ross Perot]] did not endorse either candidate for the Reform Party's nomination.  (In late October 2000, Perot publicly endorsed George W. Bush, but Perot's 1996 running-mate, Pat Choate, would go on to endorse Buchanan.)\n\nSupporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were \"tainted.\"  The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.\n\nUltimately, when the [[Federal Elections Commission]] ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the [[1996 United States presidential election|1996 election]], Buchanan won the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the United Nations and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.\n\nAs his running mate, Buchanan chose African-American activist and retired teacher from Los Angeles, [[Ezola B. Foster]]. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (political activist)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because \"he was for fair trade over [[free trade]].

(Hagelin garnered 0.1% as the [[United States Natural Law Party|Natural Law]] candidate.) In [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], Buchanan received 3,407 votes{{mdash}}which some saw as inconsistent with [[Palm Beach County]]'s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous \"[[2000 United States presidential election recount in Florida#Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots|butterfly ballot]]\", he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] stated, \"Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.\" Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500.

Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the [[neo-conservative]] Republican party leadership. Prior to the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing: \"Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values.
