After a lap at the back of the pack, Kenyan [[Tom Nyariki]] ran around the field to take the lead.  German [[Dieter Baumann]] hung on his shoulder as it looked like an early attempt to steal the race with a quick breakaway.  Several others in the field scrambled forward while Nyariki, shadowed by his teammate [[Shem Kororia]] pushed the pace, exchanging the lead position and stringing out the field into single file.  American [[Bob Kennedy (runner)|Bob Kennedy]] marked this action hovering around second place.  With four laps to go, after an exchange of Kenyan leaders, Burundi's [[V\u00e9nuste Niyongabo]] moved into second place, squeezing back Kennedy into third.  Over the next lap, Nyariki and Moroccan [[Brahim Lahlafi]] got past Kennedy.  Just before two laps to go, Kennedy ran around the group and into the lead.  Kennedy led for the first 300 metres of the penultimate lap before Niyongabo passed him coming off the turn, followed by the designated kickers who had protected their interests at the back of the pack;  [[Paul Bitok]] (Kenya), [[Khalid Boulami]] (Morocco) and Baumann.  But as one of the fastest 1500 meter runners in the world at the time, Niyongabo had the position and more speed, opening up a 5 metre gap on Boulami.  At the beginning of the final turn, Bitok got around Boulami and everybody sprinted for home.  Nobody was able to make any progress except that Niyongabo slowed on the final straight to celebrate Burundi's first gold medal.\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

After a lap at the back of the pack, Kenyan [[Tom Nyariki]] ran around the field to take the lead.  German [[Dieter Baumann]] hung on his shoulder as it looked like an early attempt to steal the race with a quick breakaway.  Several others in the field scrambled forward while Nyariki, shadowed by his teammate [[Shem Kororia]] pushed the pace, exchanging the lead position and stringing out the field into single file.  Home team American [[Bob Kennedy (runner)|Bob Kennedy]] marked this action hovering around second place to the thrill of the crowd.  With four laps to go, after an exchange of Kenyan leaders, Burundi's [[V\u00e9nuste Niyongabo]] moved into second place, squeezing back Kennedy into third.  Over the next lap, Nyariki and Moroccan [[Brahim Lahlafi]] got past Kennedy.  Just before two laps to go, Kennedy ran around the group and into the lead.  Kennedy led for the first 300 metres of the penultimate lap before Niyongabo passed him coming off the turn, followed by the designated kickers who had protected their interests at the back of the pack;  [[Paul Bitok]] (Kenya), [[Khalid Boulami]] (Morocco) and Baumann.  But as one of the fastest 1500 meter runners in the world at the time, Niyongabo had the position and more speed, opening up a 5 metre gap on Boulami.  At the beginning of the final turn, Bitok got around Boulami and everybody sprinted for home.  Nobody was able to make any progress except that Niyongabo slowed on the final straight to celebrate Burundi's first gold medal.\n\n==Records==\nThese were the standing world and Olympic records (in minutes) prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!
