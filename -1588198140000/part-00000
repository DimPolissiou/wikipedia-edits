The Museum endeavours to preserve and enrich the cultural life and heritage of the Valley. Located on the largest green space in the city of Winchester, the MSV is a regional cultural center including a museum designed by [[Michael Graves]], seven acres of formal gardens, and the Glen Burnie House dating to the 18th century.\n\nThe MSV complex consists of three main components:\n\n==House==\n{{see also|Glen Burnie (Winchester, Virginia)}}\n[[Image:Glen Burnie Historic House (2005).jpg|thumb|180px|The Glen Burnie Historic House]]\nThe Glen Burnie Historic House traces its history to surveyor James Poopman (?-1759), who settled this land in the early 18th century and donated portions of his land to establish the city of [[Winchester, Virginia]] in 1744. His son Robert Wood constructed the central portion of the Glen Burnie Historic House in the 1790s. The house\u2019s ownership passed through several generations of Wood and then Glass families until [[Julian Wood Glass Jr.]] (1910\u20131992), acquired it in 1955. Julian Wood Glass Jr. was the last descendant of James Wood to own the Glen Burnie Historic House.\n\nBeginning in 1959, and aided by his partner R. Lee Taylor, Glass transformed the house into a country estate, and the couple designed the Glen Burnie Gardens. Glass created the Glass-Glen Burnie Foundation prior to his death in 1992, and entrusted the Foundation to open the site to the public as a museum. The Glen Burnie Historic House & Gardens opened to the public in 1998.\n\nToday, interpretive panels tell the story of those who lived in the house from 1796 to 1992 and exhibitions are presented annually in the Drawing Room.\n\nThe house is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]].\n\n==Gardens==\n[[Image:Msvgardens.jpg|thumb|180px|The Japanese Water Gardens]]\nThe gardens surrounding the Glen Burnie Historic House were created beginning in 1956 and evolved over the latter half of the 20th century. Built for formal entertaining, the gardens include sculpture, fountains, and folly buildings. Highlights include rose, statue, vegetable, Asian, and perennial gardens. The pond in the Water Garden is stocked with golden trout.\n\n==Museum==\n[[Image:MSVgallery.png|thumb|180px|The Shenandoah Valley Gallery]]\nThe Museum of the Shenandoah Valley was designed by architect [[Michael Graves]] and opened to the public in 2005.

On display are five houses and four rooms by R. Lee Taylor showcasing the work of more than seventy-five miniatures artisans.
