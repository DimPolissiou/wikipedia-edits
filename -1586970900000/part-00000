Although theoretically independent, it largely came under the control of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), which envisaged it as a [[buffer state]] between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by [[Empire of Japan| Japan]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917-1922. Its first president was [[Alexander Krasnoshchyokov]].\n\nThe Far Eastern Republic occupied the territory of modern [[Zabaykalsky Krai]], [[Amur Oblast]], the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], and [[Primorsky Krai]] of [[Russia]] (the former [[Transbaikal oblast| Transbaikal]] and [[Amur Oblast |Amur]] oblasts and [[Primorsky Krai| Primorsky]] krai). Its capital was established at [[Verkhneudinsk]] (now Ulan-Ude), but in October 1920 it moved to [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].\n\nThe [[Red Army]] occupied [[Vladivostok]] on 25 October 1922. Three weeks later, on 15 November 1922, the Far Eastern Republic merged with the RSFSR.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nThe Far Eastern Republic was established in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War. During the Civil War local authorities generally controlled the towns and cities of the Russian Far East, cooperating to a greater or lesser extent with the [[White Army|White]] [[Siberia]]n government of [[Alexander Kolchak]] and with the succeeding invading forces of the Japanese Army. When the Japanese evacuated the Trans-Baikal and Amur oblasts in the spring of 1920, a political vacuum resulted.\n\nA new central authority was established at Chita to govern the Far Eastern Republic remaining in the Japanese wake.<ref name=\"RIR\">\"The Far Eastern Republic,\" ''Russian Information and Review'', vol. 1, no. 10 (Feb. 15, 1922), pp. 232\u2013233.</ref> The Far Eastern Republic was established comprising only the area around Verkhne-Udinsk, but during the summer of 1920, the Soviet government of the Amur territory agreed to join.\n\nThe Far Eastern Republic was formed two months after Kolchak's death with the tacit support of the government of Soviet Russia, which saw it as a temporary [[buffer state]] between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref name=\"Wood\">Alan Wood, \"The Revolution and Civil War in Siberia,\" in Edward Acton, Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev, and William G. Rosenberg (eds.), ''Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914\u20131921''. Bloomington, Indiana University Press, 1997; pp. 716\u2013717.</ref> Many members of the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik)|Russian Communist Party]] had disagreed with the decision to allow a new government in the region, believing that their approximately 4,000 members were capable of seizing power in their own right.<ref name=\"Dict\">George Jackson and Robert Devlin (eds.), ''Dictionary of the Russian Revolution''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 223\u2013225.</ref> However, [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other party leaders in Moscow felt that the approximately 70,000 Japanese and 12,000 American troops might regard such an action as a provocation, which might spur a further attack that the Soviet Republic could ill afford.<ref name=\"Dict\" />\n\nOn 1 April 1920, American forces headed by General [[William Sidney Graves|William S. Graves]] departed Siberia, leaving the Japanese the sole occupying power in the region with whom the Bolsheviks were forced to deal.<ref name=\"Pereira153\">N.G.O. Pereira, ''White Siberia: The Politics of Civil War''. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1996; pg. 153.</ref> This detail did not change the basic equation for the Bolshevik government in Moscow, however, which continued to see the establishment of a Far Eastern Republic as a sort of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in the east, providing the regime with a necessary breathing space that would allow it to recover economically and militarily.<ref name=\"Pereira152\">Pereira, ''White Siberia'', pg. 152.</ref>\n\nOn 6 April 1920, a hastily convened Constituent Assembly gathered at [[Verkhneudinsk]] and proclaimed the establishment of the Far Eastern Republic. Promises were made that the republic's new constitution would guarantee free elections under the principles of universal, direct, and equal suffrage and that foreign investment in the country would be encouraged.<ref name=\"Dict\" />\n\n[[File:FERgovernment.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Members of the Far Eastern Republic's Government]]\n\nThe Far Eastern Republic, controlled by moderate socialists, was only grudgingly recognized by the various cities of the region towards the end of 1920.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> Violence, atrocities, and reprisals continued to erupt periodically for the next 18 months.<ref name=\"Wood\" />\n\nJapan agreed to recognize the new buffer state in a truce with the [[Red Army]] signed 15 July 1920, effectively abandoning Ataman [[Grigory Semenov]] and his [[Russia Eastern Outskirts]].<ref name=\"Dict\" /> By October Semenov had been expelled from his base of operations in Chita. With Semenov out of the picture, the capital of the Far Eastern Republic moved to that city.<ref name=\"Wood\" />\n\nOn 11 November 1920 a provisional national assembly for the Far East met in [[Vladivostok]]. The gathering recognized the government at Chita and set 9 January 1921 as the date for new elections for the Constituent Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic.<ref name=\"Dict\" /> A new constitution closely resembling the [[United States Constitution]] was written and approved on 27 April 1921.<ref name=\"Dict\" />\n\n===The 1921 coup===\nHowever, right-wing forces rejected the idea of a fledgling democratic republic. On 26 May 1921 a White [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] took place in Vladivostok, backed by Japanese occupying forces.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> A ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of Japanese troops protected the insurgents, who sought to establish a new r\u00e9gime known as the [[Provisional Government of the Priamur]]. Shortly after the coup, Ataman Semenov arrived in Vladivostok and attempted to proclaim himself commander-in-chief\u2014an effort which failed when his Japanese benefactors forsook him.<ref name=\"Pereira155\">Pereira, ''White Siberia,'' pg. 155.</ref>\n\nThe new Provisional Government of Priamur attempted\u2014with little success\u2014to rally the various anti-Bolshevik forces to its banner.<ref name=\"Pereira156\">Pereira, ''White Siberia,'' pg. 156.</ref> Its leaders, two Vladivostok businessmen, the brothers S.D. and N.D. Merkulov found themselves left isolated when the Japanese Army announced on 24 June 1922 that it would remove all of its troops from Siberia by the end of October.<ref name=\"Pereira156\" /> A July ''[[Zemsky sobor]]'' deposed the Merkulov brothers and named a former officer of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], [[Mikhail Dieterichs|M.K.

Although theoretically independent, it largely came under the control of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), which envisaged it as a [[buffer state]] between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by [[Empire of Japan| Japan]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917-1922. Its first president was [[Alexander Krasnoshchyokov]].\n\nThe Far Eastern Republic occupied the territory of modern [[Zabaykalsky Krai]], [[Amur Oblast]], the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[Khabarovsk Krai]], and [[Primorsky Krai]] of [[Russia]] (the former [[Transbaikal oblast| Transbaikal]] and [[Amur Oblast |Amur]] oblasts and [[Primorsky Krai| Primorsky]] krai). Its capital was established at [[Verkhneudinsk]] (now Ulan-Ude), but in October 1920 it moved to [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].\n\nThe [[Red Army]] occupied [[Vladivostok]] on 25 October 1922. Three weeks later, on 15 November 1922, the Far Eastern Republic merged with the RSFSR.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nThe Far Eastern Republic was established in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War. During the Civil War local authorities generally controlled the towns and cities of the Russian Far East, cooperating to a greater or lesser extent with the [[White Army|White]] [[Siberia]]n government of [[Alexander Kolchak]] and with the succeeding invading forces of the Japanese Army. When the Japanese evacuated the Trans-Baikal and Amur oblasts in the spring of 1920, a political vacuum resulted.\n\nA new central authority was established at Chita to govern the Far Eastern Republic remaining in the Japanese wake.<ref name=\"RIR\">\"The Far Eastern Republic,\" ''Russian Information and Review'', vol. 1, no. 10 (Feb. 15, 1922), pp. 232\u2013233.</ref> The Far Eastern Republic was established comprising only the area around Verkhne-Udinsk, but during the summer of 1920, the Soviet government of the Amur territory agreed to join.\n\nThe Far Eastern Republic was formed two months after Kolchak's death with the tacit support of the government of Soviet Russia, which saw it as a temporary [[buffer state]] between the RSFSR and the territories occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]].<ref name=\"Wood\">Alan Wood, \"The Revolution and Civil War in Siberia,\" in Edward Acton, Vladimir Iu.

All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies''. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became ''British Citizens'', colonials became ''British Dependent Territories Citizens'' (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of ''(Bermuda)'' after ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or ''settled'' status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A ''British citizen'' who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly ''Bermudian passport'' if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \"British Citizen\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \"Bermudian\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', and, after 1983, a ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the ''Bermudian'' passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside.\n\nIn 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Movement was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with ''EUROPEAN UNION'' added above ''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND'' on the outside of the front cover (where the ''Bermudian'' passport reads only ''BRITISH PASSPORT'').\n\nIn 2002, ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'' was re-named ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re-designated the ''British Overseas Territories'', and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most colonials (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain ''British Citizenship'' by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen''. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a ''Bermudian'' Passport with the citizenship entered as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'' is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen'' or 'British Citizen''. As the ''Bermudian'' passport still lacked ''EUROPEAN UNION'' on the front cover, and used the country code ''BMU'' indicated inside instead of the ''GBR'' indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union. As a consequence, the only practical reason a Bermudian would obtain the ''Bermudian'' passport, whether in addition or in preference to the normal British passport with Bermudian status stamped inside, was for the purpose of entering the United States of America, which has lower entry restrictions on Bermudians than on other British nationals, but specifies they must present a British Passport with ''Government of Bermuda'' on the front, citizenship entered as either ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' or ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'', and the endorsement stamped to show the holder has been registered as a Bermudian.\n\nSince the HM Passport Office in the UK became the sole issuer of all British passports in 2016, only the normal (UK-type) British Passport is issued, whatever the type of British Citizenship entered. Bermuda Immigration enters the Bermudian status stamp separately (passports applied for in Bermuda can be obtained by handing the application to the Department of Immigration in Bermuda, which forwards the it to HM Passport office and receives it back on behalf of the applicant).\n\n==Application==\n\nAdult applicants can apply for a standard Bermudian [[ePassport]] at a cost of US$160.

All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies''. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became ''British Citizens'', colonials became ''British Dependent Territories Citizens'' (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of ''(Bermuda)'' after ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or ''settled'' status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A ''British citizen'' who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly ''Bermudian passport'' if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \"British Citizen\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \"Bermudian\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', and, after 1983, a ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the ''Bermudian'' passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside.\n\nIn 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Movement was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with ''EUROPEAN UNION'' added above ''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND'' on the outside of the front cover (where the ''Bermudian'' passport reads only ''BRITISH PASSPORT'').\n\nIn 2002, ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'' was re-named ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re-designated the ''British Overseas Territories'', and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most colonials (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain ''British Citizenship'' by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen''. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a ''Bermudian'' Passport with the citizenship entered as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'' is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen'' or 'British Citizen''. As the ''Bermudian'' passport still lacked ''EUROPEAN UNION'' on the front cover, and used the country code ''BMU'' indicated inside instead of the ''GBR'' indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union.

On the basis of several precursors, including [[Rottler's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], [[Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], and [[Pope's Compendious Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], work on a more exhaustive dictionary began in January 1913 and the first forms were printed by the end of 1923. Initially estimated at {{INR}} 100,000, the total cost of the project came to about {{INR}} 410,000. The first edition had 4,351 pages in seven volumes, including a one-volume supplement, which were printed between 1924 and 1939 and had 104,405 words, with an additional 13,357 words in the supplementary volume, totaling to 124,405 words<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/2005/04/29/stories/2005042915320300.htm | title=Tamil lexicon to be enlarged and updated | date=29 April 2005 | accessdate=27 January 2019 }}</ref> in all.\n\nThe dictionary was reprinted in 1956 and 1982.

''Agaraadhi Nigandu'' was the first alphabetically arranged lexicon published in 1594. Several dictionaries followed suit, including those by the foreign missionaries, such as ''Palporut Choolaamani'', ''Podhigai Nigandu'', Tamil\u2013Portuguese Dictionary of Fr. Antem de Proenca, ''Dictionarium Tamulicum'', ''Chathur Agaraadhi'', Fabricius's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, ''Manual Dictionary of the Tamil Language'' (The Jaffna Dictionary), ''Oru Sor Pala Porul Vilakkam'', Rottler's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Pope's Compendious Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Classical Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Tamil Pocket Dictionary, Tranquebar Dictionary, N. Kadhirvel Pillai's Dictionary, Sangam Dictionary, and ''Ilakkiya Sol Agaraadhi''.\n\nWhen the 67,542-words Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, which was sourced on the unpublished work of Rev. Joseph Night and Rev. Samuel Hutsings, was published in 1862 by the American Mission Press, it was considered the best lexicon available at that time. This dictionary by [[Miron Winslow]] was based on the works of [[Johann Rottler]], which itself was inspired from [[Johann Fabricius]]'s work in the mid-18th century. Winslow was sent out to [[Jaffna]] and then transferred to [[Madras]] by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. In both the places, he collaborated with Arumuga Navalar. It had the most number of words of any Tamil dictionary up to the time. The copyright of the dictionary was held by the American Ceylon Mission.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\">{{cite news \n  | last = Muthiah \n  | first = S. \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Tamil Lexicon \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = The Hindu\n  | date = 27 March 2011 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/madras-miscellany-the-tamil-lexicon/article1573842.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nSoon there was a demand to revise the Winslow dictionary. However, the mission suffered from lack of funds due to the closure of the Arbuthnot Bank. Citing lack of scholars in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), it then sought the help of the Madras branch of the Christian Literature Society.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\n[[G. U. Pope]], upon hearing of these plans, offered to give his collection of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language. As he had retired to [[Oxford]] to work on the Tamil Classics, he suggested an editor be sent out to Oxford to work with him on the re-issue of Winslow's dictionary. The [[Madras Presidency|Government of Madras]] and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the [[Oriental Manuscripts Library]], permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, [[J. S. Chandler]] of the American Mission, then residing in [[Kodaikanal]], forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nWith the Pope's collection it had, the government reacted to Chandler's proposal in January 1911 by appointing a five-member Lexicon committee comprising a representative each from the government, the university, the [[Madras Tamil Sangam]], and the missionary bodies of Ceylon and [[South India]]. Chandler, who was nominated by South Indian missionaries, was appointed chairman of the committee and was asked to work full-time as editor of the project.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nDetailed discussions took place for the next couple of years, and the University of Madras was made supervisor of the project. The total cost of the project was estimated at {{INR}} 100,000 for a period of five years that the project was expected to take.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nWork on the project began on 1 January 1919, with the appointment of three pundits, three clerks and two typists. The scholars included a Tamil pundit, a [[Sanskrit]] pundit and one familiar with the other [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Urdu]]. M.

Published by the [[University of Madras]], it is said to be the most comprehensive dictionary of the Tamil language to date. On the basis of several precursors, including [[Rottler's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], [[Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], and [[Pope's Compendious Tamil\u2013English Dictionary]], work on a more exhaustive dictionary began in January 1913 and the first forms were printed by the end of 1923. Initially estimated at {{INR}} 100,000, the total cost of the project came to about {{INR}} 410,000. The first edition had 4,351 pages in seven volumes, including a one-volume supplement, which were printed between 1924 and 1939 and had 104,405 words, with an additional 13,357 words in the supplementary volume, totaling to 124,405 words <ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.thehindu.com/2005/04/29/stories/2005042915320300.htm | title=Tamil lexicon to be enlarged and updated | date=29 April 2005 | accessdate=27 January 2019 }}</ref> in all.\n\nThe dictionary was reprinted in 1956 and 1982. Work on the revised and expanded edition of the dictionary, being published in twelve volumes, began on 1 May 2003, with the first volume published in 2012 under the vice-chancellorship of K. Thiruvasagam.<ref name=\"Hindu_DelayHowlersEmbarrassScholars\"/> The revised edition of the dictionary will include words taken from secondary sources like modern and old literary works, newspapers, scientific journals and inscriptions.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = John \n  | first = Ekatha Ann \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Professors craft new lexicon to make ideas come alive \n  | newspaper = The Times of India \n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = The Times Group \n  | date = 8 April 2013 \n  | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Professors-craft-new-lexicon-to-make-ideas-come-alive/articleshow/19437390.cms\n  | accessdate = 7 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAlthough the origin of the Tamil language dates back to antiquity, the first regular lexicon of the language, with words arranged alphabetically, did not appear until the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Lexicons of the earlier period were not arranged alphabetically but metrically, on the basis of the first-letter rhyme, a characteristic of [[Tamil poetry]]. ''Agaraadhi Nigandu'' was the first alphabetically arranged lexicon published in 1594. Several dictionaries followed suit, including those by the foreign missionaries, such as ''Palporut Choolaamani'', ''Podhigai Nigandu'', Tamil\u2013Portuguese Dictionary of Fr. Antem de Proenca, ''Dictionarium Tamulicum'', ''Chathur Agaraadhi'', Fabricius's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, ''Manual Dictionary of the Tamil Language'' (The Jaffna Dictionary), ''Oru Sor Pala Porul Vilakkam'', Rottler's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Pope's Compendious Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Classical Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, Tamil Pocket Dictionary, Tranquebar Dictionary, N. Kadhirvel Pillai's Dictionary, Sangam Dictionary, and ''Ilakkiya Sol Agaraadhi''.\n\nWhen the 67,542-words Winslow's Tamil\u2013English Dictionary, which was sourced on the unpublished work of Rev. Joseph Night and Rev. Samuel Hutsings, was published in 1862 by the American Mission Press, it was considered the best lexicon available at that time. This dictionary by [[Miron Winslow]] was based on the works of [[Johann Rottler]], which itself was inspired from [[Johann Fabricius]]'s work in the mid-18th century. Winslow was sent out to [[Jaffna]] and then transferred to [[Madras]] by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. In both the places, he collaborated with Arumuga Navalar. It had the most number of words of any Tamil dictionary up to the time. The copyright of the dictionary was held by the American Ceylon Mission.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\">{{cite news \n  | last = Muthiah \n  | first = S. \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = The Tamil Lexicon \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | publisher = The Hindu\n  | date = 27 March 2011 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/madras-miscellany-the-tamil-lexicon/article1573842.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nSoon there was a demand to revise the Winslow dictionary. However, the mission suffered from lack of funds due to the closure of the Arbuthnot Bank. Citing lack of scholars in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), it then sought the help of the Madras branch of the Christian Literature Society.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\n[[G. U. Pope]], upon hearing of these plans, offered to give his collection of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language. As he had retired to [[Oxford]] to work on the Tamil Classics, he suggested an editor be sent out to Oxford to work with him on the re-issue of Winslow's dictionary. The [[Madras Presidency|Government of Madras]] and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the [[Oriental Manuscripts Library]], permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, [[J. S. Chandler]] of the American Mission, then residing in [[Kodaikanal]], forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nWith the Pope's collection it had, the government reacted to Chandler's proposal in January 1911 by appointing a five-member Lexicon committee comprising a representative each from the government, the university, the [[Madras Tamil Sangam]], and the missionary bodies of Ceylon and [[South India]]. Chandler, who was nominated by South Indian missionaries, was appointed chairman of the committee and was asked to work full-time as editor of the project.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nDetailed discussions took place for the next couple of years, and the University of Madras was made supervisor of the project. The total cost of the project was estimated at {{INR}} 100,000 for a period of five years that the project was expected to take.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nWork on the project began on 1 January 1919, with the appointment of three pundits, three clerks and two typists. The scholars included a Tamil pundit, a [[Sanskrit]] pundit and one familiar with the other [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Urdu]]. M. Raghava Iyangar of [[Ramnad]], a Tamil scholar, assumed the leader of the team. Incidentally, the Tamil [[typewriter]] used for the project, with a keyboard developed by Yost of the American Mission, was the first to be ever used in an office in India.<ref name=\"Hindu_TheTamilLexicon\"/>\n\nWhen Chandler retired in 1922 at the age of 80, about 81,000 words had been compiled.

The show continues the story of Black Dynamite, Bullhorn, Cream Corn, and Honey Bee as they engage in dangerous and over-the-top misadventures sometimes involving famous celebrities such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[O. J. Simpson]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Don Cornelius]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Mr. T]], [[Diff'rent Strokes|Orphan Arnold]], [[James Brown]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Bo Derek]], [[Rick James]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Fred Rogers]] as well as Black Dynamite's recurring nemesis President [[Richard Nixon]], who was also the main villain from the film. The show makes references to the original ''Black Dynamite'' film, such as Fiendish Dr. Wu as the leader of a group of ninjas; the show is set before the events of the movie, as some characters from the film who were killed off are alive in the series (notably Bullhorn and Cream Corn). This is reinforced in one episode, where Cream Corn predicts his own future manner of death while in a helicopter.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Michael Jai White]] - Black Dynamite, [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]]\n* Byron Minns - Bullhorn, [[Rudy Ray Moore]], Singer\n* [[Kym Whitley]] - Honeybee, Old Lady\n* [[Tommy Davidson]] - Cream Corn, The Boss Man\n\n===Additional voices===\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] - Helicopter Pilot\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] - Tinbee's Singing Voice\n* [[Erykah Badu]] - Fatback Taffy, Hoe Crows, [[Rita Marley]], Wolf\n* [[Eric Bauza]] - The Fiendish Dr. Wu, Chinatown Assassin, R.A.C.I.S.T., Bill Cosby's Assistant, [[Dick Clark]], Newscaster, Child, Reporter\n* Liz Benoit - Foxxy Mama\n* [[Tae Brooks]] - [[Michael Jackson]]\n* [[Corey Burton]] - Dennis Flynn, [[Mr. Rogers]], Phil Drummond\n* [[Chance the Rapper]] - [[Bob Marley]]\n* [[Michael Colyar]] -\n* [[Affion Crockett]] - [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joe Jackson]]\n* [[DeRay Davis]] - Ninja\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Rip Taylor|Rip Tayles]], Female Cop, [[J.

The show continues the story of Black Dynamite, Bullhorn, Cream Corn, and Honey Bee as they engage in dangerous and over-the-top misadventures sometimes involving famous celebrities such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[O. J. Simpson]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Don Cornelius]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Mr. T]], [[Diff'rent Strokes|Orphan Arnold]], [[James Brown]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Bo Derek]], [[Rick James]], [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Fred Rogers]] as well as Black Dynamite's recurring nemesis President [[Richard Nixon]], who was also the main villain from the film. The show makes references to the original ''Black Dynamite'' film, such as Fiendish Dr. Wu as the leader of a group of ninjas; the show is set before the events of the movie, as some characters from the film who were killed off are alive in the series (notably Bullhorn and Cream Corn). This is reinforced in one episode, where Cream Corn predicts his own future manner of death while in a helicopter.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Michael Jai White]] - Black Dynamite, [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]]\n* Byron Minns - Bullhorn, [[Rudy Ray Moore]], Singer\n* [[Kym Whitley]] - Honeybee, Old Lady\n* [[Tommy Davidson]] - Cream Corn, The Boss Man\n\n===Additional voices===\n* [[Carlos Alazraqui]] - Helicopter Pilot\n* [[Tichina Arnold]] - Tinbee's Singing Voice\n* [[Erykah Badu]] - Fatback Taffy, Hoe Crows, [[Rita Marley]], Wolf\n* [[Eric Bauza]] - The Fiendish Dr. Wu, Chinatown Assassin, R.A.C.I.S.T., Bill Cosby's Assistant, [[Dick Clark]], Newscaster, Child, Reporter\n* Liz Benoit - Foxxy Mama\n* [[Tae Brooks]] - [[Michael Jackson]]\n* [[Corey Burton]] - Dennis Flynn, [[Mr. Rogers]], Phil Drummond\n* [[Chance the Rapper]] - [[Bob Marley]]\n* [[Michael Colyar]] -\n* [[Affion Crockett]] - [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joe Jackson]]\n* [[DeRay Davis]] - Ninja\n* [[John DiMaggio]] - [[Rip Taylor|Rip Tayles]], Female Cop, [[J.
