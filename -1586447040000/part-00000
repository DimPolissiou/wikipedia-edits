The company filling the bag with its product generally removes the tap, fills the bag (with [[wine]], [[juice]] or other liquid) and replaces the tap and then the bag is placed in the box. The bags are available as singles for semi-automatic machines or as web bags, where the bags have perforations between each one. These are used on automated filling systems where the bag is separated on line either before the bag is automatically filled or after. Depending on the end use, there are a number of options that can be used on the bag instead of the tap. The bags can be filled from chilled product temperatures up to {{convert|85|C}}.\n\nBiB packaging can be made using form seal fill (FSF) technology, where the bags are manufactured on-line from reels of film, then the FlexTap is inserted then filled on an integral rotary head filler. The BiB is currently used to package wine, soda fountain syrup products, milk, liquid chemicals, and water.\n\n==History==\nThe first commercial BiB system was invented by American chemist William R. Scholle in 1955 for the safe transportation and dispensing of battery acid.<ref name=\"Veseth\" /> Scholle's invention inspired a \"packaging revolution.\"<ref name=\"Veseth\" /> In 1991, Scholle was inducted into the packaging hall of fame for his invention.<ref>[http://www.pmmi.org/Education/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1056 Packaging Hall of Fame]</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nBiB has many common commercial applications. One of the most common commercial uses is to supply syrup to [[Soda fountain|soft drink fountains]] and to dispense bulk supplied condiments such as ketchup or mustard in the [[foodservice]] industry specifically in fast food outlets.<ref name=\"Veseth\" /> BiB technology is still used for its original application of dispensing [[sulfuric acid]] for filling lead-acid batteries in garages and dealerships. As explained further below, BiBs have also been implemented for consumer applications like boxed wine.<ref name=\"Veseth\" />\n\nFor commercial syrup applications, the customer opens one end of the box (sometimes via a pre-scored opening) and connects a compatible connector to fitment on the bag to pump out its contents. The fitment itself contains a one-way valve which opens only with pressure from the attached connector and which prevents contamination of the syrup in the bag. For consumer applications like boxed wine, there is a tap already present on the bag, so all the consumer has to do is locate the tap on the outside of the box.\n\n==Advantages==\nProducers like BiB packaging because it is inexpensive. BiB also offers environmental benefits by allowing contents of 1.5\u20131000 liters, so that less packaging or labeling is required. The material it is made from is lighter than the other plastic alternatives, providing it with a better carbon footprint.\n\n==Wine cask==\n{{Main|Box wine}}\n[[File:A 4 Litre Cask of Australian White Wine.jpg|thumb|A 4-litre cask of Australian white wine]]\n\nThe 'wine cask' was invented by [[Thomas Angove]] (1918\u20132010)<ref name=\"Veseth\" /><ref name=winecask>{{cite news |last=Lower |first=Gavin |date=March 31, 2010 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/thomas-angove-king-of-the-cask-dead-at-92/story-e6frg8zx-1225847686088 |title=Thomas Angove, king of the cask, dead at 92 |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=April 1, 2010 }}</ref> of Angove's, a winemaker from [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]], South Australia, and patented by the company on April 20, 1965.

An original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder inside the box, pour out the desired quantity of wine and then reseal it with a special peg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?behaviour=view_article&Section_id=1000&article_id=10021|title=Wine cask|accessdate=2008-01-27|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]] Sydney}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, [[Charles Malpas]] and [[Penfolds|Penfolds Wines]] patented a plastic, air-tight [[tap (valve)|tap]] welded into a [[aluminised film]] bladder, making storage much more convenient for consumers.<ref name=\"Veseth\" /> All modern wine casks now utilise some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a [[perforation|perforated]] panel on the box.\n\nThe main advantage of BiB packaging is that it prevents [[oxidation]] of the wine during dispensing. Rather than working as a conventional tap, the bladder uses gravity pressure to squeeze the liquid out of the bladder, whereas a conventional barrel tap works by allowing incoming air to displace the contents. After opening wine in a [[bottle]], it is oxidized by air in the bottle which has displaced the wine poured; wine in a bag is not touched by air and thus not subject to oxidation until it is dispensed. Cask wine is not subject to [[cork taint]] or spoilage due to slow consumption after opening.<ref name=tcnyt>{{cite news |last=Colman |first=Tyler |work=The New York Times |date=August 17, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/opinion/18colman.html |title=Drink Outside the Box }}</ref><ref name=tcforb>{{cite news |last=Colman |first=Tyler |work=Forbes.com |date=July 16, 2009 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/16/wine-packinging-boxes-lifestyle-wine-boxed-wine.html |title=Box Wines That Can Be A Hit }}</ref>\n\nAlthough a promising technology, there have been production and design problems. The impermeable bladders tend to delaminate around the tap and where the two halves are joined. If tap components are deposited in the bladder during assembly, all the bladders must be destroyed to find the components as the bladders are opaque. It has also been difficult to manufacture taps that do not leak air into the bladder since tap parts usually do not join neatly, although there have been significant improvements. Most red wines require breathing before consumption which is not possible with casks, so the wine has air circulated through it before bottling (usually by running through a centrifuge), which reduces shelf life considerably. Most casks will have a best-before date stamped. As a result, it is not intended for [[Wine Cellar|cellaring]] and should be consumed within the prescribed period.\n\n==Aseptic packaging==\nBiB is also used extensively in the packaging of processed fruit and dairy products in aseptic processes. Using aseptic packaging equipment, products can be packed in aseptic packaging. Pasteurized or UHT treated products packed into this format can be \"shelf-stable\", requiring no refrigeration. Some products can have a [[shelf life]] of up to 2 years, depending on the type of bag that is used.\n\nThe key to this unique system is that the product being filled is not exposed to the external environment at any stage during the process and as such, there is no possibility of a bacterial load being added to the product during the filling process. To ensure there is no contamination from the packaging, the bag is irradiated after the bag manufacturing process.\n\nThese packs are typically from 10 to 1200 liters and offer the advantage of cheap, disposable and transport efficient packaging.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corrugated box design]]\n*[[Tetra Brik]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n*Yam, K.
