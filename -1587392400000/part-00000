Kilmarnock have long been the most successful side in the Ayrshire derby, winning 189 times in 256 meetings.\n\nThe club have qualified for European competitions on nine occasions, their best performance coming in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1966\u201367|1966\u201367 Fairs Cup]] when they progressed to the semi-finals, eventually being eliminated by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].

On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post. The 2\u20130 defeat meant Hearts lost the title by an average of 0.042 goals.<ref>https://footballpink.net/2013/09/22/killies-final-day-victory-breaks-hearts/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030142924/https://footballpink.net/2013/09/22/killies-final-day-victory-breaks-hearts/ |date=30 October 2016 }} Killie\u2019s final day victory breaks Hearts</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/196504241.html|title=1965-04-24 Sat Hearts 0 Kilmarnock 2|website=www.londonhearts.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-93_7Gz5FTQ|title=Hearts 0 Killie 2 (24/04/1965)|last=cb76kfc|date=10 July 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Subsequently, Hearts were instrumental in pushing through a change to use goal difference to separate teams level on points.

In January 2010, Kilmarnock were second bottom of the [[2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League]], with last placed [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] just two points behind. On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager. Kilmarnock then achieved a first win in nine years against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Continued poor form, however, meant a final day showdown at Rugby Park with Falkirk for SPL survival. Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.\n\nAfter Calderwood left the team at the end the season, [[Mixu Paatelainen]] was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8754914.stm|title=Football \u2013 Mixu Paatelainen is named as the new Kilmarnock manager|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position.

McCulloch was sacked in September 2017 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table. In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later. It was Clarke\u2019s first involvement with the Scottish game in 30 years. His appointment saw a dramatic upturn in form, with the club ultimately finishing in fifth place, earning Clarke the Manager of the Year award in the process.<ref name=\"Manager of the Year\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kilmarnockfc.co.uk/Article?id=7222}}</ref> The 2018\u201319 season saw Kilmarnock celebrate their 150th anniversary, and the team continued their strong form in the league, both home and away, culminating in a final day showdown with Rangers at Rugby Park. Kilmarnock won the match 2\u20131 and the result secured a third place finish in the league, which guaranteed Kilmarnock European football for the first time since 2001. The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899.

Kilmarnock have long been the most successful side in the Ayrshire derby, winning 189 times in 256 meetings.\n\nThe club have qualified for European competitions on nine occasions, their best performance coming in the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup 1966\u201367|1966\u201367 Fairs Cup]] when they progressed to the semi-finals, eventually being eliminated by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].

On 5 January 1869 the club was founded during a general meeting at Robertson's Temperance Hotel on Portland Street.<ref>{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn= 1-874427-75-5}}</ref> Originally they played a game more similar to [[Rugby football|rugby]] and these origins are reflected to this day by the name of the club's home ground&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rugby Park]]. The difficulty in organising fixtures under this code and the growing influence of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] soon persuaded them to adopt the association code instead. At this time, the club played games in a number locations including Holm Quarry, the Grange on Irvine Road and a location close to the current Rugby Park.\n\nFollowing the formation of Scotland's earliest football clubs in the 1860s, football experienced a rapid growth but there was no formal structure, and matches were often arranged in a haphazard and irregular fashion.\n\n[[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], a Glasgow club founded in 1867, took the lead, and following an advertisement in a Glasgow newspaper in 1873, representatives from seven clubs \u2013 Queen's Park, Clydesdale, Vale of Leven, Dumbreck, Third Lanark, Eastern and Granville \u2013 attended a meeting on 13 March 1873. Furthermore, Kilmarnock sent a letter stating their willingness to form the [[Scottish Football Association]].\n\nThat day, these eight clubs formed the Scottish Football Association, and resolved that: The clubs here represented form themselves into an association for the promotion of football according to the rules of The Football Association and that the clubs connected with this association subscribe for a challenge cup to be played for annually, the committee to propose the laws of the competition.\n\nKilmarnock also competed in the inaugural [[Scottish Cup]] tournament in 1873\u201374. Their 2\u20130 defeat against [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] in the First Round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.\n\nKilmarnock joined the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] in [[1895\u201396 in Scottish football|1895]] and after winning consecutive Second Division titles were elected to the top flight for the first time in [[1899\u20131900 in Scottish football|1899]]. In 1920 Kilmarnock won the Scottish Cup for the first time beating [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] at Hampden. This was followed soon by their second success in 1929 where they beat massive favourites [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20130 at the national stadium in front of a crowd of 114,708 people.<ref name=\"Ross 1994\">{{cite book |title= Killie: The Official History |last=Ross |first=David |year=1994 |publisher=The Bath Press |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-75-5}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nIn [[1964\u201365 Scottish Division One|1964\u201365]] [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] fought out a championship title race with [[Willie Waddell]]'s Kilmarnock. In the era of two points for a win Hearts were three points clear with two games remaining. Hearts drew with [[Dundee United]] meaning the last game of the season with the two title challengers playing each other at Tynecastle would be a league decider. Kilmarnock needed to win by a two-goal margin to take the title. Hearts entered the game as favourites with both a statistical and home advantage. They also had a solid pedigree of trophy winning under Tommy Walker. Waddell's Kilmarnock in contrast had been nearly men. Four times in the previous five seasons they had finished league runners-up including Hearts\u2019 triumph in 1960. Killie had also lost three domestic cup finals during the same period including the 1962 League Cup Final defeat to Hearts. Hearts had won five of the six senior cup finals they played in under Walker. Even the final they had lost was in a replay after drawing the first game. Hearts' [[Roald Jensen]] hit the post after six minutes. Kilmarnock then scored twice through [[Davie Sneddon]] and Brian McIlroy after 27 and 29 minutes. [[Alan Gordon (Scottish footballer)|Alan Gordon]] had an excellent chance to clinch the title for Hearts in second half injury time but was denied by a [[Bobby Ferguson (footballer, born 1945)|Bobby Ferguson]] diving save pushing the ball past the post.

In January 2010, Kilmarnock were second bottom of the [[2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League]], with last placed [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] just two points behind. On 11 January 2010, Jim Jefferies left the club by \"mutual consent\" and [[Jimmy Calderwood]] was appointed manager.

Kilmarnock began the game with a two-point advantage over their rivals and a goalless draw on the day was good enough to secure top-flight football for another year. They ended the season with just 33 points, their worst points finish in the SPL.\n\nAfter Calderwood left the team at the end the season, [[Mixu Paatelainen]] was appointed manager for the next two years with an option for a third.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/k/kilmarnock/8754914.stm|title=Football \u2013 Mixu Paatelainen is named as the new Kilmarnock manager|publisher=BBC|date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Despite being the favourites for relegation that season, Kilmarnock finished the season in fifth position.

McCulloch was sacked in September 2017 with the club rooted to the bottom of the table. In an unexpected move, Kilmarnock appointed former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Brom]] coach [[Steve Clarke]] two weeks later. It was Clarke\u2019s first involvement with the Scottish game in 30 years.

Kilmarnock won the match 2\u20131 and the result secured a third place finish in the league, which guaranteed Kilmarnock European football for the first time since 2001. The season's results also set a new record points total for the club and their highest placed finish in the league since 1966. The following day, Clarke was signed by the [[Scottish FA]] to become the head coach of the [[Scotland National Football Team|Scotland National Team]].\n\n==Colours and badge==\n\n[[File:Kilmarnock_FC_150th_Anniversary_Logo.svg|thumb|left|The 150th Anniversary Badge from 2018\u20132019]]\n\nThe earliest known Kilmarnock kit from 1879 consisted of an all blue jersey with white trousers. The shirt bore a crest which was described as \"a hand, index and second fingers upright, thumb outstretched, other fingers enclosed over a palm\" (an adoption of the historic [[Clan Boyd]] chief's heraldic crest). The hand rested on a bar over a ball marked KFC. Between 1887-1890 Kilmarnock wore black and white striped tops. Thereafter, the club has predominantly played in blue and white striped or hooped shirts with either blue or white shorts. The club have also occasionally played in plain blue and plain white tops; this was suggested by Ross Quigley whom at the time was one of the first directors of the club, although the kit was later changed to the hooped style in 1920. The club's away colours have varied greatly over time. Yellow is generally regarded as the club's main third colour; but white, red and purple away kits have also appeared in recent years.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the club manufactured their kits under their own sportswear brand, 1869. Following this, Italian company Erre\u00e1 was the manufacturer. The current shirt sponsors are the locally based QTS Group with American company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] manufacturing the kit, which can only be bought from their own store at [[Rugby Park]].\n\nThe club badge is a modernised version of previous club badges. It features a ball bearing a hand in a blessing position, flanked by two red squirrels. The club's Latin motto, 'confidemus' ('we trust'), is written above the badge (similar to the [[Clan Boyd]] heraldic motto, 'confido' ('I trust')). The club adopted the badge in 1993 after [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|The Lord Lyon]] decreed that the previous badge, based heavily upon the town crest, was in breach of ancient Scottish [[heraldry|heraldic]] rules.\n\nIn October 2018 the club unveiled a special badge for the club's 150th anniversary.\n\n<center>\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la =\n| pattern_b  = _whitecollar\n| pattern_ra =\n| leftarm    = 000066\n| body       = 000066\n| rightarm   = 000066\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Dark blue jersey, white shorts, dark blue socks\n| title      = Kilmarnocks's first known kit from 1879.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so = _2_stripes_white\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 000066\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1920 & 1929\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_b  = _whitestripes\n| pattern_ra = _blue_stripes\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = 0000ff\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = League winning kit from 1965.\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _whitehoops\n| pattern_b  = _whitehoops\n| pattern_ra = _whitehoops\n| pattern_so =\n| leftarm    = 0000FF\n| body       = 0000FF\n| rightarm   = 0000FF\n| shorts     = 0000FF\n| socks      = 0000FF\n| alt        = Blue and white hooped jersey, blue shorts, blue socks.\n| title      = Home kit from 1977 to 1989\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_b  = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_ra = _Kilmarnock1997\n| pattern_sh = _fortaleza09a\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = FFFFFF\n| body       = FFFFFF\n| rightarm   = FFFFFF\n| shorts     = FFFFFF\n| socks      = FFFFFF\n| alt        = Blue and white striped jersey, white shorts, white socks.\n| title      = Scottish Cup winning kit from 1997\n}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Football kit box\n|  align      =\n| pattern_la = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_b  = _bluesides_horizontal_line\n| pattern_ra = _thickblueborder\n| pattern_sh = _bluesides_bottom_line\n| pattern_so = _bluetop\n| leftarm    = ffff66\n| body       = ffff66\n| rightarm   = ffff66\n| shorts     = ffff66\n| socks      = ffff66\n| alt        = Yellow jersey, yellow shorts, yellow socks.\n| title      = Scottish League Cup winning away kit from 2012\n}}\n{{col-end}}\n</center>\n\n==Stadium==\n{{see|Rugby Park}}\n[[File:Rugby Park.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Rugby Park]] stadium, situated on Rugby Road, home of Kilmarnock FC]]\nKilmarnock first played football matches at the present [[Rugby Park]] site in 1899. Despite this, the venue is actually Kilmarnock\u2019s fourth home ground. The Grange, Holm Quarry and Ward's Park all hosted matches before the club moved to Rugby Park in 1877. This was not the present stadium, but one situated close by near South Hamilton Street. This ground was shared by cricket and rugby teams&nbsp;\u2013 sports which Kilmarnock had played previously&nbsp;\u2013 and the connection with rugby gave the ground its name. This name was taken with the club when they moved to their present stadium.\n\nDuring 1994\u201395 season the stadium capacity was significantly reduced as three new stands were constructed; the Moffat Stand, the Chadwick Stand and the East Stand. Their completion brought the capacity of the stadium to {{SPFL-stadiums|kilmarnock}}.<ref name=\"capacity\">{{cite web |url=http://spfl.co.uk/clubs/kilmarnock/ |title=Kilmarnock Football Club|publisher=Scottish Professional Football League |accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref> The stadium opened on 6 August 1995, in a friendly match against English champions [[Blackburn Rovers]]. [[Mike Newell (footballer)|Mike Newell]] hit a hat-trick as the home team lost 5\u20130.\n\nA [[FIFA]] 2 star [[FieldTurf]] [[Artificial Turf|artificial pitch]] was installed at Rugby Park for the start of the [[2014\u201315 Kilmarnock F.C. season|2014\u201315]] season. The pitch is capable of hosting [[rugby football|rugby]] matches as well as football. A new artificial hybrid surface was installed during the 2019 close season. \n\nIn February 2019 Kilmarnock received approval to install a new safe-standing section in areas of the East and Moffat stands. The installation process was completed in early December of that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48612693 |title=Kilmarnock U16s safe-standing section is British first |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=12 June 2019 |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Panorama RugbyPark.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Rugby Park looking towards the Chadwick (Away) Stand}}\n\n==Ayrshire Derby==\nKilmarnock's biggest rivalry is with their South Ayrshire neighbours [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and together they contest the [[Ayrshire derby|Ayrshire Derby]].

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.
