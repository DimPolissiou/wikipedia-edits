Although Bismarck was a civilian politician and not a military officer, he wore a military uniform as part of the Prussian militarist culture of the time. From a painting by [[Carl Steffeck]]]]\n\nThe roots of German militarism can be found in 18th- and 19th-century [[Prussia]] and the subsequent unification of [[German Empire|Germany]] under Prussian leadership. However, [[Hans Rosenberg]] sees its origin already in the [[Teutonic Order]] and its colonization of Prussia during the late middle ages, when mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed militarist Prussian nobility, from which the [[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]] nobility would later evolve.<ref>Rosenberg, H. (1943). The Rise of the Junkers in Brandenburg-Prussia, 1410-1653: Part 1. The American Historical Review, 49(1), 1-22</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-century reign of the \"Great Elector\" [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], Brandenburg-Prussia increased its military to 40,000 men and began an effective military administration overseen by the [[General War Commissariat]]. In order to bolster his power both in interior and foreign matters, so-called ''Soldatenk\u00f6nig'' (\"soldier king\") [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] started his large-scale military reforms in 1713, thus beginning the country's tradition of a high military budget by increasing the annual military spending to 73% of the entire annual budget of Prussia. By the time of his death in 1740, the [[Prussian Army]] had grown into a [[standing army]] of 83,000 men, one of the largest in Europe, at a time when the entire Prussian populace made up 2.5 million people. Prussian military writer [[:de:Georg Heinrich von Berenhorst|Georg Henirich von Berenhorst]] would later write in hindsight that ever since the reign of the ''soldier king'', Prussia always remained \"not a country with an army, but an army with a country\" (a quote often misattributed to [[Voltaire]] and [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]]).<ref>''Aus dem Nachlasse'' von Georg Heinrich von Berenhorst.

In order that the country should not again be so easily conquered, the [[King of Prussia]] enrolled the permitted number of men for one year, trained and then dismissed that group, and enrolled another of the same size, and so on. Thus, in the course of ten years, he was able to gather an army of 420,000 men who had at least one year of military training. The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely from among the land-owning [[nobility]]. The result was that there was gradually built up a large class of professional officers on the one hand, and a much larger class, the rank and file of the army, on the other. These enlisted men had become conditioned to obey implicitly all the commands of the officers, creating a [[Social class|class]]-based culture of [[deference]].{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThis system led to several consequences. Since the officer class also furnished most of the officials for the civil administration of the country, the interests of the army came to be considered as identical to the interests of the country as a whole. A second result was that the governing class desired to continue a system which gave them so much power over the common people, contributing to the continuing influence of the [[Junker]] noble classes.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12148, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag.jpg|thumb|left|Militarism in the [[Third Reich]]]]\nMilitarism in Germany continued after World War I and the fall of the German monarchy in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], in spite of Allied attempts to crush German militarism by means of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], as the Allies saw Prussian and German militarism as one of the major causes of the Great War. During the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933), the 1920 [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]] party of [[Adolf Hitler]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined and remained affiliated with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) instead.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThroughout its entire 14-year existence, the Weimar Republic remained under threat of militaristic nationalism, as many Germans felt the Treaty of Versailles humiliated their militaristic culture. The Weimar years saw large-scale right-wing militarist and paramilitary mass organizations such as ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' as well as illegal underground militias such as the [[Freikorps#Post\u2013World War I|''Freikorps'']] and the [[Black Reichswehr]]. Formed as early as 1920, out of the latter two soon rose the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), the paramilitary branch of the Nazi party. All of these were responsible for the political violence of so-called [[Feme murders|''Feme'' murders]] and an overall atmosphere of lingering civil war during the Weimar period. Already during the Weimar era, mathematician and political writer [[Emil Julius Gumbel]] published in-depth analyses of the militarist paramilitary violence characterizing German public life as well as the state's lenient to sympathetic reaction to it if the violence was committed by the political Right.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThe [[Third Reich]] that followed the Weimar Republic was a strongly militarist state; after its fall in 1945, militarism in German culture was dramatically reduced as a backlash against the Nazi period, and the [[Allied Control Council]] and later the [[Allied High Commission]] oversaw a program of attempted fundamental re-education of the German people at large in order to put a stop to German militarism once and for all.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Germany]] today maintains a [[Bundeswehr|large, modern military]] and has one of the [[list of countries by military expenditures#List|highest defence budgets]] in the world, although the defence budget accounts for less than 1.5 percent of Germany's GDP, is lower than ''e.g.'', that of France or Great Britain, and does not meet the 2 percent goal,{{explain|date=June 2019}} like most other [[NATO]] members.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\n===India===\n[[File:NCCparade, India223.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Military parade in India]]\nThe rise of militarism in India dates back to the [[British Raj]] with the establishment of several [[Indian independence movement]] organizations such as the [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The Indian National Army (INA) played a crucial role in pressuring the British Raj after it occupied the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] with the help of [[Imperial Japan]], but the movement lost momentum due to lack of support by the [[Indian National Congress]], the [[Battle of Imphal]], and Bose's sudden death.\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, [[India\u2013Pakistan relations|tensions with neighboring Pakistan]] over the [[Kashmir dispute]] and other issues led the Indian government to emphasize military preparedness (see also the [[political integration of India]]).  After the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, India dramatically expanded its military prowess which helped India emerge victorious during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].<ref>Srinath Raghavan, ''1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 2013).</ref> India became third Asian country in the world to possess [[nuclear weapons]], culminating in the tests of 1998. The [[Kashmiri insurgency]] and recent events including the [[Kargil War|Kargil War against Pakistan]], assured that the Indian government remained committed to military expansion.\n\nIn recent years the government has increased the military expenditure across all branches and embarked on a rapid modernization programme.\n\n===Israel===\nIsrael's many [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]s since the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of the Establishment of the State]] have led to a prominence of security and defense in politics and [[civil society]], resulting in many of Israel's former high-ranking military leaders becoming top politicians: [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Ezer Weizman]], [[Ehud Barak]],  [[Shaul Mofaz]], [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Yitzhak Mordechai]], and [[Amram Mitzna]].\n\nIsrael became the second Asian country in to possess [[nuclear weapons]], see [[Nuclear weapons and Israel]].\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Japanese militarism}}\n[[File:Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the Imperial Japanese Army.jpg|thumb|1939 Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]]]\nIn parallel with 20th-century German militarism, Japanese militarism began with a series of events by which the military gained prominence in dictating Japan's affairs. This was evident in 15th-century Japan's ''Sengoku'' period or ''Age of Warring States'', where powerful [[samurai]] warlords (''[[daimy\u014d]]s'') played a significant role in Japanese politics. Japan's militarism is deeply rooted in the ancient samurai tradition, centuries before Japan's modernization. Even though a militarist philosophy was intrinsic to the shogunates, a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] style of militarism developed after the [[Meiji Restoration]], which restored the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to power and began the [[Empire of Japan]].  It is exemplified by the 1882 [[Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors]], which called for all members of the armed forces to have an absolute personal loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nIn the 20th century (approximately in the 1920s), two factors contributed both to the power of the military and chaos within its ranks. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate servinet{{typo help inline|reason=similar to servient|date=November 2019}} could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers.<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft0w1003k0&doc.view=content&chunk.id=d0e489&toc.depth=1&anchor.id=0&brand=eschol \"Strengths and Weaknesses in the Decision-Making Process\"] Craig AM ''in'' Vogel, EM (ed.), Modern Japanese Organization and Decision-Making,  University of California Press,  1987.</ref>  It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. The rebellion enraged Emperor [[Hirohito]] and he ordered its suppression, which was successfully carried out by loyal members of the military.\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to realize their ambitions of conquering all of Asia. In 1931, the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]]. Six years later, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] outside [[Beijing|Peking]] sparked the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945). Japanese troops streamed into [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], conquering Peking, [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], and the national capital of [[Battle of Nanking|Nanking]]; the last conquest was followed by the [[Nanking Massacre]]. In 1940, Japan entered into an [[Tripartite Pact|alliance]] with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]], two similarly militaristic states in Europe, and advanced out of China and into Southeast Asia. This brought about the intervention of the United States, which embargoed all [[petroleum]] to Japan. The embargo eventually precipitated the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the U.S. into World War II.\n\nIn 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, beginning the [[Occupation of Japan]] and the purging of all militarist influences from Japanese society and politics. In 1947, the new [[Constitution of Japan]] supplanted the [[Meiji Constitution]] as the fundamental law of the country, replacing the rule of the Emperor with parliamentary government. With this event, the Empire of Japan officially came to an end and the modern [[State of Japan]] was founded.\n\n===North Korea===\n{{main|Songun}}\n[[File:Propaganda of North Korea (6073871366).jpg|thumb|left|North Korean propaganda mural]]\n'''''S\u014fn'gun''''' (often transliterated \"'''songun'''\"), [[North Korea]]'s \"Military First\" policy, regards military power as the highest priority of the country.

They were called ''Sandig'' ([[wikt:guard|Guards]]), ''Kawal'' ([[Knights]]), and  ''Tanod''. They also served as the police and watchers on the land, coastlines and seas.  In 1521, The Visayan King of Mactan ''[[Lapu-Lapu]]'' of [[Cebu]], organized the first recorded military action against the Spanish colonizers, in the [[Battle of Mactan]].\n\nIn the 19th century during the [[Philippine Revolution]], [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]], a revolutionary organization against Spain at the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]]. Some notable battles were the Siege of [[Baler]], The [[Battle of Imus]], Battle of Kawit, Battle of Nueva Ecija, the victorious [[Battle of Alapan]] and the famous [[Twin Battles of Binakayan and Dalahican]]. During [[Declaration of Philippine Independence|Independence]], the President General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] established the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'', a faction separate from ''[[Katipunan]]'', and he declared the Revolutionary Government in the constitution of the [[First Philippine Republic]].\n\nAnd during the [[Filipino-American War]], the [[General]] [[Antonio Luna]] as a High-Ranking General, He Ordered a [[Conscription]] to all Citizens, a mandatory form of National Services (at any War's) for the increase the density and the manpower of the [[Philippine Army]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Philippines was one of the participants, as a member of Allied Forces, the Philippines with the U.S. Forces fought the Imperial Japanese Army, (1942\u20131945) the notable battles is the victorious [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], which also called \"The Liberation\".\n\nDuring the 1970s the President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared P.D.1081 or [[martial law]], which also made the Philippines a [[garrison]] state.

Ever since Peter the Great's reforms, Russia became one of Europe's Great Powers in terms of political and military strength. Through the Imperial era, Russia continued on her quest for territorial expansion into Siberia, Caucasus and into Eastern Europe eventually conquering the majority of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe end of Imperial rule in 1917 meant the loss of some territory following the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but much of it was quickly reconquered by the Soviet Union later on, including events such as the partition of Poland and reconquest of the Baltic states in the late 1930s and 40s. Soviet influence reached its peak after WWII in the Cold War era, where the Soviet Union occupied virtually all of Eastern Europe in a military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact: the Soviet Army playing a key role.\n\nAll this was lost however, with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia was greatly weaken in what Russia's second President Vladimir Putin called the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th Century. Nevertheless, under Putin's leadership, a resurgent modern Russia has maintained a tremendous amount of geopolitical influence in the countries that spawned from the dissolution of the Soviet Union and modern Russia remains Eastern Europe's leading if not dominant power.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Seealso|List of wars involving Turkey}}\n[[File:K\u0131rklareli 5317.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Warning sign at the fence of the military area in [[K\u0131rklareli]], [[Turkey]]]]\nMilitarism has a long history in [[Turkey]].\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] lasted for centuries and always relied on its military might, but militarism was not a part of everyday life. Militarism was only introduced into daily life with the advent of modern institutions, particularly schools, which became part of the state apparatus when the Ottoman Empire was succeeded by a new nation state \u2013 the Republic of Turkey \u2013 in 1923. The founders of the republic were determined to break with the past and modernise the country. There was, however, an inherent contradiction in that their modernist vision was limited by their military roots. The leading reformers were all military men and, in keeping with the military tradition, all believed in the authority and the sacredness of the state. The public also believed in the military. It was the military, after all, who led the nation through the [[Turkish War of Independence|War of Liberation]] (1919\u20131923) and saved the motherland.\n\nThe first military coup in the history of the republic was on [[1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|27th May 1960]], which resulted in the hanging of PM [[Adnan Menderes]] and 2 ministers, and a new constitution was introduced, creating a Constitutional Court to vet the legislation passed by parliament, and a military-dominated National Security Council to oversee the government affairs similar to the ''politburo'' in the Soviet Union.<ref>Columnist M.

This reform was the result of a conflict between Neo-Hamiltonian Republicans and [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]]-[[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] Democrats over the proper administration of the state and direction of its foreign policy. The conflict pitted proponents of professionalism, based on business management principles, against those favoring more local control in the hands of laymen and political appointees. The outcome of this struggle, including a more professional federal civil service and a strengthened presidency and executive branch, made a more expansionist foreign policy possible.<ref>Fareed Zakaria, ''From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'' (Princeton Univ.

Although Bismarck was a civilian politician and not a military officer, he wore a military uniform as part of the Prussian militarist culture of the time. From a painting by [[Carl Steffeck]]]]\n\nThe roots of German militarism can be found in 18th- and 19th-century [[Prussia]] and the subsequent unification of [[German Empire|Germany]] under Prussian leadership. However, [[Hans Rosenberg]] sees its origin already in the [[Teutonic Order]] and its colonization of Prussia during the late middle ages, when mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed militarist Prussian nobility, from which the [[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]] nobility would later evolve.<ref>Rosenberg, H. (1943). The Rise of the Junkers in Brandenburg-Prussia, 1410-1653: Part 1. The American Historical Review, 49(1), 1-22</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th-century reign of the \"Great Elector\" [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]], Brandenburg-Prussia increased its military to 40,000 men and began an effective military administration overseen by the [[General War Commissariat]]. In order to bolster his power both in interior and foreign matters, so-called ''Soldatenk\u00f6nig'' (\"soldier king\") [[Frederick William I of Prussia]] started his large-scale military reforms in 1713, thus beginning the country's tradition of a high military budget by increasing the annual military spending to 73% of the entire annual budget of Prussia. By the time of his death in 1740, the [[Prussian Army]] had grown into a [[standing army]] of 83,000 men, one of the largest in Europe, at a time when the entire Prussian populace made up 2.5 million people. Prussian military writer [[:de:Georg Heinrich von Berenhorst|Georg Henirich von Berenhorst]] would later write in hindsight that ever since the reign of the ''soldier king'', Prussia always remained \"not a country with an army, but an army with a country\" (a quote often misattributed to [[Voltaire]] and [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau]]).<ref>''Aus dem Nachlasse'' von Georg Heinrich von Berenhorst.

In order that the country should not again be so easily conquered, the [[King of Prussia]] enrolled the permitted number of men for one year, trained and then dismissed that group, and enrolled another of the same size, and so on. Thus, in the course of ten years, he was able to gather an army of 420,000 men who had at least one year of military training. The officers of the army were drawn almost entirely from among the land-owning [[nobility]]. The result was that there was gradually built up a large class of professional officers on the one hand, and a much larger class, the rank and file of the army, on the other. These enlisted men had become conditioned to obey implicitly all the commands of the officers, creating a [[Social class|class]]-based culture of [[deference]].{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThis system led to several consequences. Since the officer class also furnished most of the officials for the civil administration of the country, the interests of the army came to be considered as identical to the interests of the country as a whole. A second result was that the governing class desired to continue a system which gave them so much power over the common people, contributing to the continuing influence of the [[Junker]] noble classes.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12148, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag.jpg|thumb|left|Militarism in the [[Third Reich]]]]\nMilitarism in Germany continued after World War I and the fall of the German monarchy in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]], in spite of Allied attempts to crush German militarism by means of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], as the Allies saw Prussian and German militarism as one of the major causes of the Great War. During the period of the [[Weimar Republic]] (1918\u20131933), the 1920 [[Kapp Putsch]], an attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the republican government, was launched by disaffected members of the armed forces. After this event, some of the more radical militarists and nationalists were submerged in grief and despair into the [[NSDAP]] party of [[Adolf Hitler]], while more moderate elements of militarism declined and remained affiliated with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP) instead.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThroughout its entire 14-year existence, the Weimar Republic remained under threat of militaristic nationalism, as many Germans felt the Treaty of Versailles humiliated their militaristic culture. The Weimar years saw large-scale right-wing militarist and paramilitary mass organizations such as the ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' as well as illegal underground militias such as the [[Freikorps#Post\u2013World War I|''Freikorps'']] and the [[Black Reichswehr]]. Formed as early as 1920, out of the latter two soon rose the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), the paramilitary branch of the Nazi party. All of these were responsible for the political violence of so-called [[Feme murders|''Feme'' murders]] and an overall atmosphere of lingering civil war during the Weimar period. Already during the Weimar era, mathematician and political writer [[Emil Julius Gumbel]] published in-depth analyses of the militarist paramilitary violence characterizing German public life as well as the state's lenient to sympathetic reaction to it if the violence was committed by the political Right.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThe [[Third Reich]] that followed the Weimar Republic was a strongly militarist state; after its fall in 1945, militarism in German culture was dramatically reduced as a backlash against the Nazi period, and the [[Allied Control Council]] and later the [[Allied High Commission]] oversaw a program of attempted fundamental re-education of the German people at large in order to put a stop to German militarism once and for all.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\nThe [[Federal Republic of Germany]] today maintains a [[Bundeswehr|large, modern military]] and has one of the [[list of countries by military expenditures#List|highest defence budgets]] in the world, although the defence budget accounts for less than 1.5 percent of Germany's GDP, is lower than ''e.g.'', that of France or Great Britain, and does not meet the 2 percent goal,{{explain|date=June 2019}} like most other [[NATO]] members.{{Citation needed|date = June 2019}}\n\n===India===\n[[File:NCCparade, India223.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Military parade in India]]\nThe rise of militarism in India dates back to the [[British Raj]] with the establishment of several [[Indian independence movement]] organizations such as the [[Indian National Army]] led by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]]. The Indian National Army (INA) played a crucial role in pressuring the British Raj after it occupied the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] with the help of [[Imperial Japan]], but the movement lost momentum due to lack of support by the [[Indian National Congress]], the [[Battle of Imphal]], and Bose's sudden death.\n\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, [[India\u2013Pakistan relations|tensions with neighboring Pakistan]] over the [[Kashmir dispute]] and other issues led the Indian government to emphasize military preparedness (see also the [[political integration of India]]).  After the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, India dramatically expanded its military prowess which helped India emerge victorious during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].<ref>Srinath Raghavan, ''1971: A Global History of the Creation of Bangladesh'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 2013).</ref> India became third Asian country in the world to possess [[nuclear weapons]], culminating in the tests of 1998. The [[Kashmiri insurgency]] and recent events including the [[Kargil War|Kargil War against Pakistan]], assured that the Indian government remained committed to military expansion.\n\nIn recent years the government has increased the military expenditure across all branches and embarked on a rapid modernization programme.\n\n===Israel===\nIsrael's many [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]s since the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Declaration of the Establishment of the State]] have led to a prominence of security and defense in politics and [[civil society]], resulting in many of Israel's former high-ranking military leaders becoming top politicians: [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[Ariel Sharon]], [[Ezer Weizman]], [[Ehud Barak]],  [[Shaul Mofaz]], [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Yitzhak Mordechai]], and [[Amram Mitzna]].\n\nIsrael became the second Asian country in to possess [[nuclear weapons]], see [[Nuclear weapons and Israel]].\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Japanese militarism}}\n[[File:Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the Imperial Japanese Army.jpg|thumb|1939 Recruitment poster for the Tank School of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]]]\nIn parallel with 20th-century German militarism, Japanese militarism began with a series of events by which the military gained prominence in dictating Japan's affairs. This was evident in 15th-century Japan's ''Sengoku'' period or ''Age of Warring States'', where powerful [[samurai]] warlords (''[[daimy\u014d]]s'') played a significant role in Japanese politics. Japan's militarism is deeply rooted in the ancient samurai tradition, centuries before Japan's modernization. Even though a militarist philosophy was intrinsic to the shogunates, a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalist]] style of militarism developed after the [[Meiji Restoration]], which restored the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] to power and began the [[Empire of Japan]].  It is exemplified by the 1882 [[Imperial Rescript to Soldiers and Sailors]], which called for all members of the armed forces to have an absolute personal loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nIn the 20th century (approximately in the 1920s), two factors contributed both to the power of the military and chaos within its ranks. One was the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] Law, which required the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to nominate servinet{{typo help inline|reason=similar to servient|date=November 2019}} could be formed. This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country. Another factor was ''[[gekokuj\u014d]]'', or institutionalized [[insubordination|disobedience]] by junior officers.<ref>[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft0w1003k0&doc.view=content&chunk.id=d0e489&toc.depth=1&anchor.id=0&brand=eschol \"Strengths and Weaknesses in the Decision-Making Process\"] Craig AM ''in'' Vogel, EM (ed.), Modern Japanese Organization and Decision-Making,  University of California Press,  1987.</ref>  It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals, to the extent of assassinating their seniors. In 1936, this phenomenon resulted in the [[February 26 Incident]], in which junior officers attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and killed leading members of the Japanese government. The rebellion enraged Emperor [[Hirohito]] and he ordered its suppression, which was successfully carried out by loyal members of the military.\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] wrecked Japan's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to realize their ambitions of conquering all of Asia. In 1931, the [[Kwantung Army]] (a Japanese military force stationed in [[Manchuria]]) staged the [[Mukden Incident]], which sparked the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Invasion of Manchuria]] and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]]. Six years later, the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] outside [[Beijing|Peking]] sparked the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945). Japanese troops streamed into [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], conquering Peking, [[Battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], and the national capital of [[Battle of Nanking|Nanking]]; the last conquest was followed by the [[Nanking Massacre]]. In 1940, Japan entered into an [[Tripartite Pact|alliance]] with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]], two similarly militaristic states in Europe, and advanced out of China and into Southeast Asia. This brought about the intervention of the United States, which embargoed all [[petroleum]] to Japan. The embargo eventually precipitated the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the U.S. into World War II.\n\nIn 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, beginning the [[Occupation of Japan]] and the purging of all militarist influences from Japanese society and politics. In 1947, the new [[Constitution of Japan]] supplanted the [[Meiji Constitution]] as the fundamental law of the country, replacing the rule of the Emperor with parliamentary government. With this event, the Empire of Japan officially came to an end and the modern [[State of Japan]] was founded.\n\n===North Korea===\n{{main|Songun}}\n[[File:Propaganda of North Korea (6073871366).jpg|thumb|left|North Korean propaganda mural]]\n'''''S\u014fn'gun''''' (often transliterated \"'''songun'''\"), [[North Korea]]'s \"Military First\" policy, regards military power as the highest priority of the country.

They were called ''Sandig'' ([[wikt:guard|Guards]]), ''Kawal'' ([[Knights]]), and  ''Tanod''. They also served as the police and watchers on the land, coastlines and seas.  In 1521, The Visayan King of Mactan ''[[Lapu-Lapu]]'' of [[Cebu]], organized the first recorded military action against the Spanish colonizers, in the [[Battle of Mactan]].\n\nIn the 19th century during the [[Philippine Revolution]], [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] founded the [[Katipunan]], a revolutionary organization against Spain at the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin]]. Some notable battles were the Siege of [[Baler]], The [[Battle of Imus]], Battle of Kawit, Battle of Nueva Ecija, the victorious [[Battle of Alapan]] and the famous [[Twin Battles of Binakayan and Dalahican]]. During [[Declaration of Philippine Independence|Independence]], the President General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] established the ''[[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]]'', a faction separate from ''[[Katipunan]]'', and he declared the Revolutionary Government in the constitution of the [[First Philippine Republic]].\n\nAnd during the [[Filipino-American War]], the [[General]] [[Antonio Luna]] as a High-Ranking General, He Ordered a [[Conscription]] to all Citizens, a mandatory form of National Services (at any War's) for the increase the density and the manpower of the [[Philippine Army]].\n\nDuring World War II, the Philippines was one of the participants, as a member of Allied Forces, the Philippines with the U.S. Forces fought the Imperial Japanese Army, (1942\u20131945) the notable battles is the victorious [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], which also called \"The Liberation\".\n\nDuring the 1970s the President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared P.D.1081 or [[martial law]], which also made the Philippines a [[garrison]] state. By the [[Philippine Constabulary]] (PC) and [[Integrated National Police]] (INP), The High-School or Secondary and College Education have a compulsory Curriculum concerning the Military, and nationalism which is the \"Citizens Military Training\" (CMT) And  \"Reserve Officers Training Corps\" (ROTC).\nBut in 1986, when the constitution changed, this form of National Service Training Program became non-compulsory but still part of the Basic Education.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/bbm8816.0001.001/*|title=Militarism in the Philippines|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Russia===\n{{see also|Russian Nationalism|Nuclear arms race}}\n[[File:World nuclear weapons.png|thumb|right|270px|Large [[nuclear weapons]] stockpile with global range (dark blue)]]\nRussia has also had a long history of Militarism continuing on to the present day driven by her desire to protect her Western Frontier which has no [[buffer zone|natural buffers]] between potential invaders in the rest of continental Europe and her heartlands in European Russia. Ever since Peter the Great's reforms, Russia became one of Europe's Great Powers in terms of political and military strength. Through the Imperial era, Russia continued on her quest for territorial expansion into Siberia, Caucasus and into Eastern Europe eventually conquering the majority of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nThe end of Imperial rule in 1917 meant the loss of some territory following the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], but much of it was quickly reconquered by the Soviet Union later on, including events such as the partition of Poland and reconquest of the Baltic states in the late 1930s and 40s. Soviet influence reached its peak after WWII in the Cold War era, where the Soviet Union occupied virtually all of Eastern Europe in a military alliance known as the Warsaw Pact: the Soviet Army playing a key role.\n\nAll this was lost however, with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia was greatly weaken in what Russia's second President Vladimir Putin called the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th Century. Nevertheless, under Putin's leadership, a resurgent modern Russia has maintained a tremendous amount of geopolitical influence in the countries that spawned from the dissolution of the Soviet Union and modern Russia remains Eastern Europe's leading if not dominant power.\n\n===Turkey===\n{{Seealso|List of wars involving Turkey}}\n[[File:K\u0131rklareli 5317.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Warning sign at the fence of the military area in [[K\u0131rklareli]], [[Turkey]]]]\nMilitarism has a long history in [[Turkey]].\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] lasted for centuries and always relied on its military might, but militarism was not a part of everyday life. Militarism was only introduced into daily life with the advent of modern institutions, particularly schools, which became part of the state apparatus when the Ottoman Empire was succeeded by a new nation state \u2013 the Republic of Turkey \u2013 in 1923. The founders of the republic were determined to break with the past and modernise the country. There was, however, an inherent contradiction in that their modernist vision was limited by their military roots. The leading reformers were all military men and, in keeping with the military tradition, all believed in the authority and the sacredness of the state. The public also believed in the military. It was the military, after all, who led the nation through the [[Turkish War of Independence|War of Liberation]] (1919\u20131923) and saved the motherland.\n\nThe first military coup in the history of the republic was on [[1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|27th May 1960]], which resulted in the hanging of PM [[Adnan Menderes]] and 2 ministers, and a new constitution was introduced, creating a Constitutional Court to vet the legislation passed by parliament, and a military-dominated National Security Council to oversee the government affairs similar to the ''politburo'' in the Soviet Union.<ref>Columnist M. Ali K\u0131\u015flal\u0131 cites Army commander Faruk G\u00fcrler for this comparison in his article \"MGK de\u011fi\u015fti ama\" in the newspaper \"Radikal\", dated 4 July 2007. https://www.ab.gov.tr/p.php?e=36535</ref> The second military coup took place on [[1971 Turkish military memorandum|12th March 1971]], this time only forcing the government to resign and installing a cabinet of technocrats and bureaucrats without dissolving the parliament. The third military coup took place on [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|12 September 1980]], which resulted in the dissolution of parliament and all political parties as well as imposition of a much more authoritarian constitution. There was another military intervention that was called a \"post-modern coup\" on [[1997 Turkish military memorandum|28 February 1997]] which merely forced the government to resign, and finally an unsuccessful military coup attempt on [[2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|15th July 2016]].\n\nThe constitutional referendums in [[2010 Turkish constitutional referendum|2010]] and [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum|2017]] have changed the composition and role of the National Security Council, and placed the armed forces under the control of civilian government.\n\n===United States===\n<!--Should this be made into its own page as well?-->\n{{Seealso|United States involvement in regime change|Foreign interventions by the United States}}\n[[File:I want you for U.S. Army 3b48465u original.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Poster shows [[Uncle Sam]] pointing his finger at the viewer in order to recruit soldiers for the [[National Army (USA)|American Army]] during [[World War I]].]]\n[[File:US Navy 050526-N-0000X-001 Cover photo of the new coffee table photo book Defending Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The cover of a coffee table book about the [[US Navy]].]]\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries political and military leaders reformed the US federal government to establish a stronger central government than had ever previously existed for the purpose of enabling the nation [[American imperialism|to pursue an imperial policy]] in the Pacific and in the Caribbean and [[economic militarism]] to support the development of the new industrial economy. This reform was the result of a conflict between Neo-Hamiltonian Republicans and [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]]-[[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] Democrats over the proper administration of the state and direction of its foreign policy. The conflict pitted proponents of professionalism, based on business management principles, against those favoring more local control in the hands of laymen and political appointees. The outcome of this struggle, including a more professional federal civil service and a strengthened presidency and executive branch, made a more expansionist foreign policy possible.<ref>Fareed Zakaria, ''From Wealth to Power: The Unusual Origins of America's World Role'' (Princeton Univ. Press, 1998), chap.4.</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[American Civil War]] the national army fell into disrepair. Reforms based on various European states including Britain, Germany, and Switzerland were made so that it would become responsive to control from the central government, prepared for future conflicts, and develop refined command and support structures; these reforms led to the development of professional military thinkers and cadre.\n\nDuring this time the ideas of [[Social Darwinism]] helped propel [[Overseas expansion of the United States|American overseas expansion]] in the Pacific and Caribbean.<ref name=\"Hofstadter1992\">{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=Social Darwinism in American Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ty8aEmWc_ekC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22Spanish-American%20War%22&f=false|year=1992|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-5503-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Tucker2009\">{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22social%20Darwinism%22&f=false|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1}}</ref> This required modifications for a more efficient central government due to the added administration requirements (see above).\n[[File:Military Expenditures 2018 SIPRI.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A pie chart showing global military expenditures by country for 2018, in US$ billions, according to SIPRI.]]\nThe enlargement of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was considered essential to the occupation and control of the new territories acquired from Spain in its defeat ([[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]]). The previous limit by legislation of 24,000 men was expanded to 60,000 regulars in the new army bill on 2 February 1901, with allowance at that time for expansion to 80,000 regulars by presidential discretion at times of national emergency.\n\nU.S. forces were again enlarged immensely for World War I. Officers such as [[George S. Patton]] were permanent captains at the start of the war and received temporary promotions to colonel.\n\nBetween the first and second world wars, the [[US Marine Corps]] engaged in questionable activities in the [[Banana Wars]] in Latin America. Retired Major General [[Smedley Butler]], who was at the time of his death the most decorated Marine, spoke strongly against what he considered to be trends toward fascism and militarism.  Butler briefed Congress on what he described as a [[Business Plot]] for a military coup, for which he had been suggested as leader; the matter was partially corroborated, but the real threat has been disputed. The Latin American expeditions ended with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Good Neighbor policy]] of 1934.\n\n[[File:President Barack Obama speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University 9.jpg|thumb|250px|Former President [[Barack Obama]] speaking on the military intervention in Libya at the National Defense University.]]\n\nAfter World War II, there were major cutbacks, such that units responding early in the Korean War under [[United Nations]] authority (e.g., [[Task Force Smith]]) were unprepared, resulting in catastrophic performance. When [[Harry S. Truman]] fired [[Douglas MacArthur]], the tradition of civilian control held and MacArthur left without any hint of military coup.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] resulted in serious permanent military buildups. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a retired top military commander elected as a civilian President, warned, as he was leaving office, of the development of a [[military-industrial complex]].<ref>Audra J. Wolfe, ''Competing with the Soviets: Science, Technology, and the State in Cold War America'' (Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 2013), chap.2.</ref> In the Cold War, there emerged many civilian academics and industrial researchers, such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Herman Kahn]], who had significant input into the use of military force.  The complexities of nuclear strategy and the debates surrounding them helped produce a new group of 'defense intellectuals' and think tanks, such as the [[RAND Corporation|Rand Corporation]] (where Kahn, among others, worked).<ref>Fred Kaplan, ''The Wizards of Armageddon'' (1983, reissued 1991).</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that the United States has shifted to a state of neomilitarism since the end of the Vietnam War. This form of militarism is distinguished by the reliance on a relatively small number of volunteer fighters; heavy reliance on complex technologies; and the rationalization and expansion of government advertising and recruitment programs designed to promote military service.<ref>[[Alasdair Roberts (academic)|Roberts, Alasdair]].

It features previously unreleased material from 1966, 1967, and 1970.\n\nThe first three tracks come from the recording sessions for ''[[Jefferson Airplane Takes Off]]'' and feature vocals by [[Signe Toly Anderson]] and [[Skip Spence]] on drums.  \"Runnin' 'Round This World\" had been previously released as a B-side on the \"It's No Secret\" single.  \n\nThe closing two tracks on side one and the first track from side two come from the recording sessions for ''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]''. Tracks from the \"Takes Off\" and \"Surrealistic Pillow\" sessions appeared later as bonus tracks on the respective 2003 remasters, albeit with different mixes.\n\n\"Up or Down\" comes from the early recording sessions for ''[[Bark (Jefferson Airplane album)|Bark]]'' before [[Marty Balin]] chose to leave the band.  \"[[Mexico (Jefferson Airplane song)|Mexico]]\" and \"Have You Seen the Saucers?\" had been previously released as a non-album single in 1970, but this was the first LP on which the two songs appeared.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline        = Side one\n\n| title1          = [[High Flying Bird (song)|High Flying Bird]]\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = [[Billy Edd Wheeler]]\n| length1         = 2:30\n\n| title2          = Runnin' Round This World\n| note2           = from single B-side RCA #8679\n| writer2         = [[Marty Balin]], [[Paul Kantner]]\n| length2         = 2:21\n\n| title3          = It's Alright\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = Kantner, [[Skip Spence]]\n| length3         = 2:15\n\n| title4          = In the Morning\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = [[Jorma Kaukonen]]\n| length4         = 6:25\n\n| title5          = J.P.P.

He was first elected to the House of Representatives at the [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960 general election]] as the Member of Parliament for [[T\u0101maki (New Zealand electorate)|Tamaki]]. Muldoon served successively as [[Minister of Tourism (New Zealand)|Minister of Tourism]] (1967), [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] (1967\u20131972), and [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] (1972). He became [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1974 and soon led the National Party to a decisive victory in the [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975 general election]].\n\nMuldoon came to power promising to lead \"a Government of the ordinary bloke.\"{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=21}} He appointed himself Minister of Finance. His tenure as Prime Minister was plagued by an economic pattern of stagnation, high inflation, growing unemployment, and high external debts and borrowing. Economic policies of the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Muldoon Government]] included national [[superannuation]], wage and price freezes, industrial incentives, and the [[Think Big]] industrial projects. In foreign policy, Muldoon adopted an [[anti-Soviet]] stance and re-emphasised New Zealand's defence commitments to the United States and Australia under the [[ANZUS]] pact. His refusal to stop a [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand and the United States|Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand]] divided the country and led to unprecedented civil disorder in 1981. Muldoon led his party to two additional election victories in [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] and [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981]]. He called a [[1984 New Zealand general election|snap election in 1984]], in which National suffered a significant defeat to [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]. Shortly before leaving office, amid a [[1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]], Muldoon was forced by the incoming Government to devalue the New Zealand dollar.\n\nIn 1984, he was only the second Prime Minister (after [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]]) to receive a [[knighthood]] while still in office. Muldoon was a polarising figure and has been variously described as a \"bully\",{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=29}} an \"enigma,\"{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=28}} and \"a strong believer in the battler, the little man, the ordinary citizen and his or her rights.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/Files/67725421.pdf |title=The Official Information Act and Privacy: New Zealand's Story |first=Marie |last=Shroff |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nRobert David Muldoon was born in [[Auckland]] on 25 September 1921 to parents James Henry Muldoon and Amie Rusha Muldoon (n\u00e9e Browne).<ref name=\"archives biography\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.govt.nz/has/politicians-papers/robert-muldoon-official-biography|title=Robert Muldoon Official Biography|publisher=[[Archives New Zealand]]|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> At the age of five Muldoon slipped while playing on the front gate, damaging his cheek and resulting in a distinctive scar.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}\n\nWhen Muldoon was aged eight, his father was admitted to [[Whau Lunatic Asylum|Auckland Mental Hospital]] at Point Chevalier,<ref name=\"archives biography\"/> where he died nearly 20 years later in 1946.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|pp=20\u201321}} This left Muldoon's mother to raise him on her own. During this time Muldoon came under the strong formative influence of his fiercely intelligent, iron-willed maternal grandmother Jerusha, a committed socialist. Though Muldoon never accepted her creed, he did develop under her influence a potent ambition, a consuming interest in politics, and an abiding respect for New Zealand's [[welfare state]]. Muldoon won a scholarship to attend [[Mount Albert Grammar School]]{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}} from 1933 to 1936. He left school at age 15, finding work at [[Fletcher Construction]] and then the Auckland Electric Power Board as an arrears clerk.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}} He studied accountancy by correspondence.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}\n\n[[File:Muldoon's wedding 04.jpg|thumb|Robert Muldoon married Thea Flyger in 1951.]]\nIn 1951 Muldoon married [[Thea Muldoon|Thea Dale Flyger]], who he had met through the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Muldoon|1974|p=25}} The couple had three children, Barbara, Jennifer and Gavin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28152/family-album-1950s-wedding|title=Family album: 1950s wedding: Te Ara \u2013 Robert David Muldoon|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref> Lady Muldoon, who died at age 87 in 2015, was appointed a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1993 New Year Honours]]<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/53154/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 53154], 30 December 1992; retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref> and made a [[Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] in the [[1986 New Year Honours]].<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/50362/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 50362], 30 December 1985; retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nMuldoon joined the [[New Zealand Army]] in November 1940 during the Second World War, and served in the South Pacific and in Italy.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, New Zealand's economy had significantly declined due to several international developments: a decline in international wool prices in 1966, Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 (which deprived New Zealand of its formerly most important export market), and the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The \"Muldoon Years\" were to feature Muldoon's obstinate and resourceful attempts to maintain New Zealand's \"cradle to the grave\" [[welfare state]], dating from 1935, in the face of a changing world. Muldoon had remained National's Finance spokesman when he became party leader, and as a result became Minister of Finance as well as Prime Minister\u2014thus concentrating enormous power in his hands.  He is the last to hold both posts {{As of|2019|alt= to date}}.\n\nIn his first term (1975\u20131978) Muldoon focused on reducing expenditure, but struggled with the growing cost of his own superannuation scheme,{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=88}} partly due to the many tax rebates and exemptions he passed for lower income earners.{{sfn|Easton|1981|p=?}} By March 1978 the economy was growing again,<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" /> but unemployment and inflation remained high.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" />\n\n====The Dawn Raids====\nRobert Muldoon continued his Labour predecessor Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]]'s policy of arresting and deporting [[Pacific Islander]] overstayers which had begun in 1974.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=227\u2013230}} Since the 1950s, the New Zealand government had encouraged substantial emigration from several Pacific countries including [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] to fill a labour shortage caused by the post\u2013war economic boom. Consequently, the Pacific Islander population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971, with a substantial number overstaying their visas.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=28\u201329}} The economic crisis of the early 1970s led to increased crime, unemployment and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=64-65}}\n\nIn July 1974, Muldoon as opposition leader had promised to cut immigration and to \"get tough\" on law and order issues. He claimed that the Labour government's immigration policies had contributed to the economic recession and undermined the \"New Zealand way of life\" by causing a housing shortage. During the 1975 general elections, the National Party had played a controversial electoral advertisement that was later criticized for stoking [[racism|negative racial sentiments]] about Polynesian migrants.<ref name=\"National Party advertisement\">{{cite AV media |people=|year=1975 |title=''National Party advertisement''|trans-title=|medium= |language= |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/video/2158/national-party-advertisement |accessdate= |format= documentary |time= |publisher=TVNZ Television New Zealand, Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Muldoon's  government accelerated and increased the Kirk government's police raids against Pacific overstayers.

The raids were also criticized by elements of the [[New Zealand Police]] and the ruling National Party for damaging relations with the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=234\u2013236}} At the time, Pacific Islanders comprised only one third of the overstayers (who were primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]]), but made up 86% of those arrested and prosecuted for overstaying.<ref name=\"Dawn Raids\" /> The Muldoon government's treatment of overstayers also damaged relations with Pacific countries like Samoa and Tonga, and generated criticism from the South Pacific Forum. By 1979, the Muldoon government terminated the Dawn Raids, concluding that they had failed to alleviate the economic problems.<ref name=\"Dawn Raids\" />\n\n====Moyle Affair====\nMuldoon, in Parliament, accused opposition MP and former Cabinet minister [[Colin Moyle]] of having been questioned by the police on suspicion of homosexual activities in 1977. Homosexual activity between men [[LGBT rights in New Zealand|was illegal in New Zealand]] at the time. After changing his story several times, Moyle resigned from Parliament. He later said that he had not been obliged to resign, but had done so because \"the whole thing just made me sick\".<ref name=\"Moyle Interview\">{{cite news|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Evening Post]]|date=25 August 1990|page=25|title=Interview with Colin Moyle}}</ref> It has been suggested that Muldoon saw him as a leadership threat and acted accordingly.{{sfn|Lange|2005|p=Chapter 7}} Ironically, the subsequent {{By-election link|Mangere|1977}} was won by [[David Lange]], and the attention that this got him helped propel him to the leadership of the Labour Party and his landslide victory over Muldoon in the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 election]]. In a 1990 interview, Moyle said that the scandal had made him a \"sadder and wiser person\".<ref name=\"Moyle Interview\" />\n\n====Appointment of Holyoake as Governor-General====\n[[File:Walter Scheel in New Zealand October 1978.jpg|thumb|250px|Prime Minister Muldoon (far left) and Governor-General [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]] (third from left) with West German President [[Walter Scheel]] (fourth from right), pictured in the conservatory at Government House Wellington in October 1978]]\nAs Prime Minister, Muldoon had the sole right to advise [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth II]] on whom to appoint as Governor-General. With the term of Sir [[Denis Blundell]] as Governor-General coming to an end in 1977, a new appointee was needed. Muldoon sent a message to the Queen on 15 December 1976 putting forward former Prime Minister Sir Keith Holyoake as his appointee, which the Queen approved.{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=298}} The announcement was made by the Queen at the end of [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II#1970s|her tour of New Zealand on 7 March 1977]], from the Royal Yacht [[HMY Britannia]] in [[Lyttelton Harbour]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=299}}\n\nThis choice was controversial because Holyoake was a sitting Cabinet minister. Both opponents and supporters of Muldoon's government claimed that it was a political appointment; a number of National MPs, including his deputy, disagreed with the precedent of having a politician as Governor-General.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=208}} The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Rowling complained that he had not been consulted on the appointment, and then stated that he would act to remove Holyoake as Governor-General should the Labour Party win the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 general election]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=300}} As a result of the appointment, Holyoake resigned from Parliament, resulting in the [[1977 Pahiatua by-election|Pahiatua by-election of 1977]]. He was succeeded in his seat by [[John Falloon]].\n\n====1978 election====\n{{Main|1978 New Zealand general election}}\nA month before the general election Muldoon remained the preferred Prime Minister, though his support slipped from 60% to 48% while Rowling's rose 8 points to 38%.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=259}} At the election, held on 25 November, National lost three seats and it dropped 7.9 percentage points in the vote. Although the party had been returned to office with a majority of seats, it had lost the popular vote to a resurgent Labour Party.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=259}} National Party President [[George Alan Chapman|George Chapman]] argued National struggled at the election because of the many boundary changes and issues with the electoral roll,{{sfn|Chapman|1980|p=165}} contrary to Muldoon's claims that the media going against National had caused the decline in support.{{sfn|Chapman|1980|p=182}}\n\n===Second term: 1978\u20131981===\n[[File:New Zealand Cabinet, 1981.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Cabinet photograph during [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s tour of New Zealand in October 1981; Muldoon is seated on the Queen's right]]\n\n====Taxation====\nMuldoon initially opposed [[indirect tax|indirect consumer taxation]] on the basis that it would penalise poor people and increase inflation due to compensatory wage increases.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=271}} However, in May 1979 he attempted to increase tax revenue by levying 10% to 20% taxes on a wide range of goods, including petrol, lawnmowers, caravans and boats.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Goldsmith|first1=Paul|title=Taxes: Gradual complication of the tax system \u2013 1960 to 1984|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/taxes/page-6|publisher=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=15 November 2016|date=11 March 2010}}</ref> The taxes were criticised for being discriminatory, ineffective, and a \"quick fix\" that precluded necessary fundamental reform of the taxation system (as there were no income tax cuts to reflect the shift to indirect taxation).{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=271}} The boat and caravan levies, in particular, crippled both industries, as potential buyers could not afford the 20% tax on top of the construction costs, resulting in additional unemployment as workers were laid off.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/news/10344516/Vantastic-explores-NZ-caravan-history|title=Vantastic explores NZ caravan history|first=Geoff|last=Lewis|date=4 August 2014|publisher=Fairfax New Zealand}}</ref>\n\n====Communism and the Soviet Union====\nAs with other conservative governments during the [[Cold War]], Muldoon adopted an anti-Soviet stance. As a long-time National Party activist, Muldoon rejected [[Communism]] as an \"alien\" collectivist philosophy. During the television programme ''Gallery'' in the later 1960s, he also rebuked left-leaning clergymen who had criticised [[apartheid in South Africa]] for failing to oppose Soviet communism. Muldoon was critical of Communist influence in New Zealand's trade union movement.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=85\u201387}} He also viewed the [[Moscow]]-aligned [[Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), a break-away faction from the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]], as a Soviet [[fifth column]] that was trying to subvert New Zealand and the South Pacific island states. In various speeches and press releases, he would accuse the SUP and other Communist groups of instigating strikes and organising protests against US naval visits and New Zealand's sporting contacts with South Africa.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}}\n\nAs Prime Minister, he accepted both the American and Chinese views that the [[Soviet Union]] was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}} Muldoon would also join the United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and other Western leaders in condemning the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 and boycotting the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. However, his government did not participate in the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union because it would have hurt New Zealand's predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for providing funding to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon's government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=106\u2013129}}\n\n====Arthur Allan Thomas====\n{{main|Arthur Allan Thomas}}\nAfter [[David Yallop]] drew Muldoon's attention to the case of Arthur Allan Thomas, twice convicted for the murders of farming couple [[Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]], Muldoon asked Robert Adams-Smith, a [[List of King's and Queen's Counsel in New Zealand|QC]], to review the case.

Muldoon's favoured candidate was [[Sue Wood]], at the time National's Vice President and later party President.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=137}} National selected the economically liberal [[Don Brash]], a future Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] and later leader of the National Party, as its candidate. Brash lost the by-election to Social Credit's [[Gary Knapp]], a major upset and a blow for Muldoon's leadership. Muldoon blamed Brash and the party organisation for the defeat, but was strongly rebuked by the party for this stance.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=137}} The loss of the by-election provided the catalyst for growing opposition within the National Party to Muldoon's leadership.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=138}}\n\n====Colonels' Coup====\nFollowing the loss of the East Coast Bays by-election, Muldoon faced an abortive attempt in October\u2013November 1980 to oust him as leader.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=204}} Known as the Colonels' Coup after its originators\u2014[[Jim Bolger]], [[Jim McLay]] and [[Derek Quigley]]\u2014it aimed to replace Muldoon with his more economically liberal deputy, [[Brian Talboys]]. Muldoon, who was overseas at the time, saw the plotters off with relative ease, especially since Talboys himself was a reluctant draftee.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=206}} No other serious challenge to his leadership occurred in his years as Prime Minister until after the 1984 election.\n\n====Springbok Tour====\n{{Main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand}}\n\nProfessing a belief that politics should not interfere with sport, Muldoon resisted pressure to bar the 1981 tour by the [[Springboks]], the national [[rugby union]] squad of ''[[apartheid]]''-era South Africa. By allowing \"the Tour\", Muldoon was accused of breaking the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]] (to form a common policy on sporting with South Africa amongst the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], signed after the boycott of the [[Montreal Olympics]] in 1976). Muldoon noted, however, that the Gleneagles Agreement had been amended and, in an article in ''[[The Times]]'', that he had not broken the Gleneagles Agreement because \"New Zealand and subsequently other countries made it clear that they could not subscribe to an agreement which required them to abrogate the freedoms of their sportsmen and prohibit sporting contacts\".<ref name=\"muldoon_robert\">{{cite web|work=The Times |location=UK |date=28 July 1981 |accessdate=12 October 2009 |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-28-16-003&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-28-16 |last=Muldoon |first=Robert |title=Robert Muldoon: Why My Small Country is Now Being Rent Asunder}}</ref> \"The Tour\", as it has become known, provoked massive public demonstrations and some of the worst social schisms New Zealand has ever seen. Muldoon came down firmly on the pro-Tour side, arguing that sport and politics should be kept separate. He argued that his refusal to ban the Springboks was anti-authoritarian, leaving it up to individual consciences whether to play sports with representatives of [[apartheid]]. He also argued that allowing their rugby team to tour did not mean supporting apartheid, any more than playing a [[Soviet Union]] team meant supporting Communism.\n\n====Think Big====\n{{Main|Think Big}}\nThe [[Iranian Revolution]] had led to the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil shock of 1979]]. Economic growth in New Zealand had only just begun to recover from the 1976\u201378 recession when the oil shock hit.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\"/> Economic pressures continued to build: Muldoon tried to control spiraling increases in wages and inflation through a trade-off with the [[trade union|trade-union]] leadership: a reduction in the tax rate in exchange for an agreement not to press for further rounds of wage increases, similar to [[Prices and Incomes Accord|The Accord]] reached in Australia in 1983.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=43}} The [[Federation of Labour (New Zealand)|Federation of Labour]]'s President [[Jim Knox]], who Muldoon did not get along with, refused to co-operate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5k13/knox-walter-james|title=Knox, Walter James|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=30 October 2012|last=Franks|first=Peter|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref> In response, Muldoon introduced his Think Big strategy, in which the government borrowed heavily to invest in large-scale industrial projects, predominantly energy-related.<ref name=\"te ara muldoon page 7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6m1/muldoon-robert-david/page-7|title=Story: Muldoon, Robert David Page 7 \u2013 Economic policy and problems|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The projects' goals were to make New Zealand more than 60% self-sufficient in energy, and to produce 425,000 jobs.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/revolution-1-fortress-new-zealand-2009|title=Revolution \u2013 1, Fortress New Zealand {{!}} Television {{!}} NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|language=en|others=NZ On Screen|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> The Clyde dam, which generated electricity to be used to manufacture aluminum for export, was typical of Muldoon's efforts to shelter New Zealand from the troubles of the rest of the world.<ref name=\":1\" /> This dam was described to symbolise \"fortress New Zealand.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Think Big projects were a major part of Muldoon's legacy.

The 1979 budget introduced incentives for the conversions, and New Zealand emerged as the first country to make [[Bi-fuel vehicle|dual-fuel cars]] commonplace.

Muldoon had also fallen out with former supporter and millionaire businessman [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]], who made good on a threat to create his own party in protest at Muldoon's economic policies. In 1983 the [[New Zealand Party]] was formed by Jones and took a significant share of the vote at the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/page-2|title=Story: National Party Page 2 \u2013 Consensus and division|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic recession and wage and price freeze ====\nWith Think Big failing to deliver on its promise, Muldoon imposed an [[incomes policy]]: a freeze on wages and most prices (items excluded included fresh meat, frozen meat, items sold at auction and \"women's fashion clothing other than standard lines\"<ref name=\"Beattie\">{{cite web |last1=Beattie |first1=David |authorlink1=David Beattie |title=The Price Freeze Regulations 1982 |url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/nz/legis/num_reg/pfr1982235.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2019 |date=April 1982}}</ref>), interest rates and dividends across the country in April 1982.<ref name=\"Beattie\"/> Against this he offered a \"sweetener\" of a tax cut which cost the New Zealand treasury approximately a billion New Zealand dollars.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=42}} Ultimately the Wage and Price Freeze, which had been intended only to last for a year, remained in force for nearly two years and was repealed by the incoming Labour Government. Years later, Muldoon admitted that the freeze was a political mistake.\n\nThe second recession during Muldoon's premiership hit in September 1982.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" /> New Zealand's economy contracted again by 3% and unemployment hit 5.1% by 1983, and net emigration remained high.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" />\n\n====Falklands War====\nIn 1982, Muldoon's government supported the British in the [[Falklands War]]. While New Zealand did not directly participate in the conflict, Muldoon undertook to send the frigates [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS ''Canterbury'']] and [[HMNZS Waikato (F-55)|HMNZS ''Waikato'']] to the Indian Ocean to relieve Royal Navy frigates, so that they could in their turn deploy in the conflict. New Zealand also broke off its diplomatic relations with Argentina. In defence of his support for the war, Muldoon wrote an article that was published in ''[[The Times]]'', entitled \"Why we Stand by our Mother Country\":\n\n<blockquote>We are a free and independent nation but in time of trouble we stand with our mother country...New Zealand's decision to break off diplomatic relations with Argentina over the Falklands, immediately after Britain had done so, was not because of Britain's support on the sporting issue. The reason goes much deeper than that. It is in the context of the statement made by a Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1939: \"Where Britain goes, we go.\" We see the Falklands as British territory and the Falklands Islanders as subjects of our Queen. We live at the end of the line and we know the feeling of isolation...With the Falklands Islands, it is family. Historically, Britain has so often on great occasions thrown up the leader that the occasion demanded. I regard Margaret Thatcher as one of the finest and straightest politicians I have ever met...In 1939 we learned the folly of appeasement. A great catastrophe was the price that was paid. The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased. New Zealand will back Britain all the way.<ref>{{cite news|last=Muldoon|first=Robert|title=Why we stand with our mother country|publisher=The Times|date=20 May 1982|page=14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the House of Commons [[Margaret Thatcher]] responded by saying that \"The New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support of this country, of the Falkland Islanders and of the rule of liberty and the rule of law\".<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1982/may/20/engagements \"House of Commons PQs\", 20 May 1982]</ref>\n\n====Closer Economic Relations====\n[[File:Malcolm Fraser & Robert Muldoon (17473395099).jpg|thumb|Muldoon and Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], meeting in 1978 for a Regional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney]]\nMuldoon initiated a [[Closer Economic Relations]] (CER) free trade agreement with Australia to liberalise trade, which came into effect from New Year's Day 1982. The aim of total free trade between the two countries was achieved in 1990, five years ahead of schedule.<ref>{{cite web|title=Signing of CER agreement strengthens trans-Tasman trade ties|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/signing-cer-strengthens-tasman-trade-ties|website=www.nzhistory.net.nz|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Nuclear ships policy and the snap election of 1984====\n{{main|1984 New Zealand general election}}\nUltimately, the end of Muldoon's government came following a late-night clash with National backbencher [[Marilyn Waring]] over highly contentious Opposition-sponsored [[Nuclear proliferation|nuclear-free New Zealand]] legislation, in which Waring told him she would [[Crossing the floor|cross the floor]] (giving the Opposition a victory). On 14 June 1984, a visibly drunk{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=375}} Muldoon called a [[1984 New Zealand general election|snap election]] for 14 July that same year; historians noted the unfortunate coincidence with [[Bastille Day]].<ref name=nzhistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/robert-muldoon |title=Robert Muldoon |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}</ref> A journalist commented that a one-month election campaign would not give Muldoon much time to which Muldoon replied, audibly slurring his words, \"It doesn't give my opponents much time to run up to an election, does it?\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLDve40cxlk</ref> Six days before the election, a televised leader's debate was held between Muldoon and [[David Lange]] where Muldoon finished the debate by saying \"I love you, Mr Lange\", a sign of defeat by Muldoon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Two Titans: Muldoon, Lange and Leadership|last=Johansson|first=Jon|publisher=Dunmore Publishing|year=2005|isbn=1-877399-01-9|location=Wellington, New Zealand|pages=}}</ref> Muldoon was heavily defeated by [[David Lange]]'s resurgent Labour Party, which won 56 seats to National's 37 with massive [[vote splitting]] caused by the [[New Zealand Party]] in particular. Muldoon's drunkenness when announcing the election date led to it being known as the \"schnapps election\".<ref name=nzhistory/>\n\nIt is a strong convention in New Zealand politics that a prime minister does not [[dropping the writ|ask for an early election]] unless he or she cannot govern, or unless they need to seek the electorate's endorsement on a matter of national importance (as was the case in [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). Muldoon justified the snap election because he felt Waring's revolt impeded his ability to govern. Indeed, it was obvious that Muldoon was finding it hard to pass financial measures with [[neo-liberal]] rebels like [[Ruth Richardson]] and [[Derek Quigley]] voting against the Government on certain issues.{{sfn|Bohan|2004|p=95}} However, Waring said that she would not have denied Muldoon confidence or [[Loss of Supply|supply]].  This has led historians to question Muldoon's excuse for calling a snap election, since he still would have had the constitutional means to govern.\n\n====Foreign exchange and constitutional crises====\n{{Main|1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis}}\nA final controversy occurred during the course of the election and transfer of government: during early 1984 [[Roderick Deane]], then Deputy Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]], became concerned that the [[New Zealand dollar]] (which had a fixed exchange-rate to the US dollar) had become significantly overvalued and was vulnerable to currency speculation on the financial markets in the event of a \"significant political event\".{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=69}} This was exacerbated by media speculation following a leak that an incoming Labour administration would be likely to significantly devalue the NZ dollar upon election. The Reserve Bank counselled Muldoon that the dollar should be devalued. Muldoon ignored the advice, owing to his belief that it would hurt poor New Zealanders in the medium term, and in June 1984 announced the snap election mentioned above which, as predicted, caused an immediate run on the dollar.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=388\u2013389}}\n\nFollowing the election the controversy became a [[constitutional crisis]]: Muldoon refused to do as the incoming government instructed, causing the currency crisis to worsen.

The newly elected neo-liberal and unexpectedly pro-free market Fourth Labour Government embarked on a series of fundamental free-market reforms known (after Labour's finance minister [[Roger Douglas]]) as [[Rogernomics]], and which were then continued from 1990\u201394 by the succeeding National government's policies known as (after National's finance minister [[Ruth Richardson]]) as [[Ruthanasia]], which marked a fundamental break with the more interventionist policies of Muldoon's era.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=71}}\n\n===Honours===\nMuldoon became an [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Additional Member of the Companion of Honour]] in the [[1977 Birthday Honours|1977 Silver Jubilee and Queen's Birthday Honours]],<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/47237/supplements/7127 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 47237, 10 June 1977].

However, he continued to openly agitate against McLay, refusing to withdraw into an \"elder statesman\" role as McLay wanted. The relationship between the two bottomed out when Muldoon criticised the entire party leadership, forcing McLay to demote him to the lowest rank in the National caucus.\n\nMuldoon continued to undermine McLay until 1986, when McLay was ousted in turn by his own deputy (and Muldoon's preferred candidate), [[Jim Bolger]], who had served as Minister of Labour for the latter half of Muldoon's term as Prime Minister. Bolger returned Muldoon to the front bench as spokesperson for Foreign Affairs, pitting him directly against Prime Minister [[David Lange]].{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=209}}\n\nMuldoon remained as the MP for Tamaki until shortly before his death.

He continued to write in international economic journals, arguing that the unemployment that had arisen as a result of the free market reforms was worse than the gains that were made, a view that came to be popular by the time of the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] in 1999.\n\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical \n|image1 = Rob Muldoon grave distant.jpg\n|caption1 = Muldoon's gravestone\n|image2 = Rob Muldoon gravestone close.jpg\n|caption2 = The plaque on the gravestone\n}}\nMuldoon had a short stage career in a New Zealand production of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', held at Auckland's His Majesty's Theatre (demolished soon after the production ended),{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=209}} starring as the narrator.

Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st]] [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]], from 1975 to 1984, while [[Leader of the New Zealand National Party|Leader]] of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]].\n\nServing as a corporal and sergeant in the army in the [[Second World War]],{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=36}} Muldoon completed his training as an accountant and returned to New Zealand as its first fully qualified [[cost accounting|cost accountant]]. He was first elected to the House of Representatives at the [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960 general election]] as the Member of Parliament for [[T\u0101maki (New Zealand electorate)|Tamaki]]. Muldoon served successively as [[Minister of Tourism (New Zealand)|Minister of Tourism]] (1967), [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] (1967\u20131972), and [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] (1972). He became [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] in 1974 and soon led the National Party to a decisive victory in the [[1975 New Zealand general election|1975 general election]].\n\nMuldoon came to power promising to lead \"a Government of the ordinary bloke.\"{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=21}} He appointed himself Minister of Finance. His tenure as Prime Minister was plagued by an economic pattern of stagnation, high inflation, growing unemployment, and high external debts and borrowing. Economic policies of the [[Third National Government of New Zealand|Muldoon Government]] included national [[superannuation]], wage and price freezes, industrial incentives, and the [[Think Big]] industrial projects. In foreign policy, Muldoon adopted an [[anti-Soviet]] stance and re-emphasised New Zealand's defence commitments to the United States and Australia under the [[ANZUS]] pact. His refusal to stop a [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand and the United States|Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand]] divided the country and led to unprecedented civil disorder in 1981. Muldoon led his party to two additional election victories in [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978]] and [[1981 New Zealand general election|1981]]. He called a [[1984 New Zealand general election|snap election in 1984]], in which National suffered a significant defeat to [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]. Shortly before leaving office, amid a [[1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]], Muldoon was forced by the incoming Government to devalue the New Zealand dollar.\n\nIn 1984, he was only the second Prime Minister (after [[Keith Holyoake|Sir Keith Holyoake]]) to receive a [[knighthood]] while still in office. Muldoon was a polarising figure and has been variously described as a \"bully\",{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=29}} an \"enigma,\"{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=28}} and \"a strong believer in the battler, the little man, the ordinary citizen and his or her rights.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.privacy.org.nz/assets/Files/67725421.pdf |title=The Official Information Act and Privacy: New Zealand's Story |first=Marie |last=Shroff |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nRobert David Muldoon was born in [[Auckland]] on 25 September 1921 to parents James Henry Muldoon and Amie Rusha Muldoon (n\u00e9e Browne).<ref name=\"archives biography\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.govt.nz/has/politicians-papers/robert-muldoon-official-biography|title=Robert Muldoon Official Biography|publisher=[[Archives New Zealand]]|date=26 May 2011|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> At the age of five Muldoon slipped while playing on the front gate, damaging his cheek and resulting in a distinctive scar.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}\n\nWhen Muldoon was aged eight, his father was admitted to [[Whau Lunatic Asylum|Auckland Mental Hospital]] at Point Chevalier,<ref name=\"archives biography\"/> where he died nearly 20 years later in 1946.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|pp=20\u201321}} This left Muldoon's mother to raise him on her own. During this time Muldoon came under the strong formative influence of his fiercely intelligent, iron-willed maternal grandmother Jerusha, a committed socialist. Though Muldoon never accepted her creed, he did develop under her influence a potent ambition, a consuming interest in politics, and an abiding respect for New Zealand's [[welfare state]]. Muldoon won a scholarship to attend [[Mount Albert Grammar School]]{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}} from 1933 to 1936. He left school at age 15, finding work at [[Fletcher Construction]] and then the Auckland Electric Power Board as an arrears clerk.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}} He studied accountancy by correspondence.{{sfn|Wolfe|2005|p=206}}\n\n[[File:Muldoon's wedding 04.jpg|thumb|Robert Muldoon married Thea Flyger in 1951.]]\nIn 1951 Muldoon married [[Thea Muldoon|Thea Dale Flyger]], who he had met through the Junior Nationals.{{sfn|Muldoon|1974|p=25}} The couple had three children, Barbara, Jennifer and Gavin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/28152/family-album-1950s-wedding|title=Family album: 1950s wedding: Te Ara \u2013 Robert David Muldoon|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|accessdate=1 March 2015}}</ref> Lady Muldoon, who died at age 87 in 2015, was appointed a [[Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1993 New Year Honours]]<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/53154/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 53154], 30 December 1992; retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref> and made a [[Companion of the Queen's Service Order]] in the [[1986 New Year Honours]].<ref>[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/50362/supplements/29 ''London Gazette'' (supplement), No. 50362], 30 December 1985; retrieved 9 January 2013.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nMuldoon joined the [[New Zealand Army]] in November 1940 during the Second World War, and served in the South Pacific and in Italy.

He quickly became active in the party, making two sacrificial-lamb bids for Parliament against entrenched but vulnerable [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] incumbents in [[1954 New Zealand general election|1954]] ([[Mount Albert (New Zealand electorate)|Mount Albert]]) and [[1957 New Zealand general election|1957]] ([[Waitemata (New Zealand electorate)|Waitemata]]).{{sfn|Muldoon|1974|p=25}} But in [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960]] he won election as MP for the suburban Auckland electorate of [[T\u0101maki (New Zealand electorate)|Tamaki]], winning against [[Bob Tizard]], who had taken the former National seat in 1957. In [[1960 New Zealand general election|1960]], an electoral swing brought [[Keith Holyoake]] back to power as Prime Minister of the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]]. Muldoon would represent the Tamaki constituency for the next 32 years.\n\nMuldoon, along with [[Duncan MacIntyre (New Zealand politician)|Duncan MacIntyre]] and [[Peter Gordon (politician)|Peter Gordon]] who entered parliament in the same year, became known as the \"Young Turks\" because of their criticism of the party's senior leadership.<ref name=\"te ara muldoon page 3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6m1/muldoon-robert-david/page-3|title=Story: Muldoon, Robert David: Page 3 \u2013 National MP|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> From his early years as a Member of Parliament, Muldoon became known as ''Piggy'';<ref name=\"te ara muldoon page 5\" /> the [[wiktionary:en:epithet|epithet]] that would remain with him throughout his life even amongst those who were his supporters.

In 1961 he was one of ten National MPs to cross the floor and vote with the Opposition to remove [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|capital punishment]] for murder from the [[Crimes Act 1961|Crimes Bill]] that the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]] had introduced. In 1977 he voted against the [[Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977]] when the issue also came up as a conscience vote.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=23}}\n\nMuldoon was appointed in 1961 to the Public Accounts Committee, which in 1962 became the Public Expenditure Committee.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, New Zealand's economy had significantly declined due to several international developments: a decline in international wool prices in 1966, Britain joining the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 (which deprived New Zealand of its formerly most important export market), and the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The \"Muldoon Years\" were to feature Muldoon's obstinate and resourceful attempts to maintain New Zealand's \"cradle to the grave\" [[welfare state]], dating from 1935, in the face of a changing world. Muldoon had remained National's Finance spokesman when he became party leader, and as a result became Minister of Finance as well as Prime Minister\u2014thus concentrating enormous power in his hands.  He is the last to hold both posts {{As of|2019|alt= to date}}.\n\nIn his first term (1975\u20131978) Muldoon focused on reducing expenditure, but struggled with the growing cost of his own superannuation scheme,{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=88}} partly due to the many tax rebates and exemptions he passed for lower income earners.{{sfn|Easton|1981|p=?}} By March 1978 the economy was growing again,<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" /> but unemployment and inflation remained high.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" />\n\n====The Dawn Raids====\nRobert Muldoon continued his Labour predecessor Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]]'s policy of arresting and deporting [[Pacific Islander]] overstayers which had begun in 1974.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=227\u2013230}} Since the 1950s, the New Zealand government had encouraged substantial emigration from several Pacific countries including [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] to fill a labour shortage caused by the post\u2013war economic boom. Consequently, the Pacific Islander population in New Zealand had grown to 45,413 by 1971, with a substantial number overstaying their visas.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=28\u201329}} The economic crisis of the early 1970s led to increased crime, unemployment and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Parker|2005|p=64-65}}\n\nIn July 1974, Muldoon as opposition leader had promised to cut immigration and to \"get tough\" on law and order issues. He claimed that the Labour government's immigration policies had contributed to the economic recession and undermined the \"New Zealand way of life\" by causing a housing shortage. During the 1975 general elections, the National Party had played a controversial electoral advertisement that was later criticized for stoking [[racism|negative racial sentiments]] about Polynesian migrants.<ref name=\"National Party advertisement\">{{cite AV media |people=|year=1975 |title=''National Party advertisement''|trans-title=|medium= |language= |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/video/2158/national-party-advertisement |accessdate= |format= documentary |time= |publisher=TVNZ Television New Zealand, Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Muldoon's  government accelerated and increased the Kirk government's police raids against Pacific overstayers.

The raids were also criticized by elements of the [[New Zealand Police]] and the ruling National Party for damaging relations with the Pacific Islander community.{{sfn|Anae|2012|pp=234\u2013236}} At the time, Pacific Islanders comprised only one third of the overstayers (who were primarily from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[South Africa]]), but made up 86% of those arrested and prosecuted for overstaying.<ref name=\"Dawn Raids\" /> The Muldoon government's treatment of overstayers also damaged relations with Pacific countries like Samoa and Tonga, and generated criticism from the South Pacific Forum. By 1979, the Muldoon government terminated the Dawn Raids, concluding that they had failed to alleviate the economic problems.<ref name=\"Dawn Raids\" />\n\n====Moyle Affair====\nMuldoon, in Parliament, accused opposition MP and former Cabinet minister [[Colin Moyle]] of having been questioned by the police on suspicion of homosexual activities in 1977. Homosexual activity between men [[LGBT rights in New Zealand|was illegal in New Zealand]] at the time. After changing his story several times, Moyle resigned from Parliament.

With the term of Sir [[Denis Blundell]] as Governor-General coming to an end in 1977, a new appointee was needed. Muldoon sent a message to the Queen on 15 December 1976 putting forward former Prime Minister Sir Keith Holyoake as his appointee, which the Queen approved.{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=298}} The announcement was made by the Queen at the end of [[List of Commonwealth visits made by Queen Elizabeth II#1970s|her tour of New Zealand on 7 March 1977]], from the Royal Yacht [[HMY Britannia]] in [[Lyttelton Harbour]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=299}}\n\nThis choice was controversial because Holyoake was a sitting Cabinet minister. Both opponents and supporters of Muldoon's government claimed that it was a political appointment; a number of National MPs, including his deputy, disagreed with the precedent of having a politician as Governor-General.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=208}} The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Rowling complained that he had not been consulted on the appointment, and then stated that he would act to remove Holyoake as Governor-General should the Labour Party win the [[1978 New Zealand general election|1978 general election]].{{sfn|McLean|2006|p=300}} As a result of the appointment, Holyoake resigned from Parliament, resulting in the [[1977 Pahiatua by-election|Pahiatua by-election of 1977]]. He was succeeded in his seat by [[John Falloon]].\n\n====1978 election====\n{{Main|1978 New Zealand general election}}\nA month before the general election Muldoon remained the preferred Prime Minister, though his support slipped from 60% to 48% while Rowling's rose 8 points to 38%.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=259}} At the election, held on 25 November, National lost three seats and it dropped 7.9 percentage points in the vote.

As a long-time National Party activist, Muldoon rejected [[Communism]] as an \"alien\" collectivist philosophy. During the television programme ''Gallery'' in the later 1960s, he also rebuked left-leaning clergymen who had criticised [[apartheid in South Africa]] for failing to oppose Soviet communism. Muldoon was critical of Communist influence in New Zealand's trade union movement.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=85\u201387}} He also viewed the [[Moscow]]-aligned [[Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), a break-away faction from the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]], as a Soviet [[fifth column]] that was trying to subvert New Zealand and the South Pacific island states. In various speeches and press releases, he would accuse the SUP and other Communist groups of instigating strikes and organising protests against US naval visits and New Zealand's sporting contacts with South Africa.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}}\n\nAs Prime Minister, he accepted both the American and Chinese views that the [[Soviet Union]] was an aggressive power with hegemonic ambitions in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=27}} Muldoon would also join the United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] and other Western leaders in condemning the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979 and boycotting the [[1980 Summer Olympics]]. However, his government did not participate in the US-led trade boycott against the Soviet Union because it would have hurt New Zealand's predominantly agricultural export economy. In 1980, the National government also expelled the Soviet Ambassador, Vsevolod Sofinski, for providing funding to the SUP. Despite his antagonism towards the Soviet Union and domestic Communist movements, Muldoon's government still maintained economic relations with the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Wilson|2004|pp=106\u2013129}}\n\n====Arthur Allan Thomas====\n{{main|Arthur Allan Thomas}}\nAfter [[David Yallop]] drew Muldoon's attention to the case of Arthur Allan Thomas, twice convicted for the murders of farming couple [[Harvey and Jeannette Crewe]], Muldoon asked Robert Adams-Smith, a [[List of King's and Queen's Counsel in New Zealand|QC]], to review the case.

Muldoon blamed Brash and the party organisation for the defeat, but was strongly rebuked by the party for this stance.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=137}} The loss of the by-election provided the catalyst for growing opposition within the National Party to Muldoon's leadership.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=138}}\n\n====Colonels' Coup====\nFollowing the loss of the East Coast Bays by-election, Muldoon faced an abortive attempt in October\u2013November 1980 to oust him as leader.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=204}} Known as the Colonels' Coup after its originators\u2014[[Jim Bolger]], [[Jim McLay]] and [[Derek Quigley]]\u2014it aimed to replace Muldoon with his more economically liberal deputy, [[Brian Talboys]]. Muldoon, who was overseas at the time, saw the plotters off with relative ease, especially since Talboys himself was a reluctant draftee.{{sfn|Gustafson|1986|p=206}} No other serious challenge to his leadership occurred in his years as Prime Minister until after the 1984 election.\n\n====Springbok Tour====\n{{Main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand}}\n\nProfessing a belief that politics should not interfere with sport, Muldoon resisted pressure to bar the 1981 tour by the [[Springboks]], the national [[rugby union]] squad of ''[[apartheid]]''-era South Africa. By allowing \"the Tour\", Muldoon was accused of breaking the 1977 [[Gleneagles Agreement]] (to form a common policy on sporting with South Africa amongst the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], signed after the boycott of the [[Montreal Olympics]] in 1976). Muldoon noted, however, that the Gleneagles Agreement had been amended and, in an article in ''[[The Times]]'', that he had not broken the Gleneagles Agreement because \"New Zealand and subsequently other countries made it clear that they could not subscribe to an agreement which required them to abrogate the freedoms of their sportsmen and prohibit sporting contacts\".<ref name=\"muldoon_robert\">{{cite web|work=The Times |location=UK |date=28 July 1981 |accessdate=12 October 2009 |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-28-16-003&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-28-16 |last=Muldoon |first=Robert |title=Robert Muldoon: Why My Small Country is Now Being Rent Asunder}}</ref> \"The Tour\", as it has become known, provoked massive public demonstrations and some of the worst social schisms New Zealand has ever seen. Muldoon came down firmly on the pro-Tour side, arguing that sport and politics should be kept separate. He argued that his refusal to ban the Springboks was anti-authoritarian, leaving it up to individual consciences whether to play sports with representatives of [[apartheid]]. He also argued that allowing their rugby team to tour did not mean supporting apartheid, any more than playing a [[Soviet Union]] team meant supporting Communism.\n\n====Think Big====\n{{Main|Think Big}}\nThe [[Iranian Revolution]] had led to the [[1979 energy crisis|second oil shock of 1979]]. Economic growth in New Zealand had only just begun to recover from the 1976\u201378 recession when the oil shock hit.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\"/> Economic pressures continued to build: Muldoon tried to control spiraling increases in wages and inflation through a trade-off with the [[trade union|trade-union]] leadership: a reduction in the tax rate in exchange for an agreement not to press for further rounds of wage increases, similar to [[Prices and Incomes Accord|The Accord]] reached in Australia in 1983.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=43}} The [[Federation of Labour (New Zealand)|Federation of Labour]]'s President [[Jim Knox]], who Muldoon did not get along with, refused to co-operate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5k13/knox-walter-james|title=Knox, Walter James|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=30 October 2012|last=Franks|first=Peter|accessdate=7 April 2015}}</ref> In response, Muldoon introduced his Think Big strategy, in which the government borrowed heavily to invest in large-scale industrial projects, predominantly energy-related.<ref name=\"te ara muldoon page 7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/6m1/muldoon-robert-david/page-7|title=Story: Muldoon, Robert David Page 7 \u2013 Economic policy and problems|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The projects' goals were to make New Zealand more than 60% self-sufficient in energy, and to produce 425,000 jobs.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/revolution-1-fortress-new-zealand-2009|title=Revolution \u2013 1, Fortress New Zealand {{!}} Television {{!}} NZ On Screen|website=www.nzonscreen.com|language=en|others=NZ On Screen|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> The Clyde dam, which generated electricity to be used to manufacture aluminum for export, was typical of Muldoon's efforts to shelter New Zealand from the troubles of the rest of the world.<ref name=\":1\" /> This dam was described to symbolise \"fortress New Zealand.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Think Big projects were a major part of Muldoon's legacy.

The 1979 budget introduced incentives for the conversions, and New Zealand emerged as the first country to make [[Bi-fuel vehicle|dual-fuel cars]] commonplace.

Muldoon had also fallen out with former supporter and millionaire businessman [[Bob Jones (businessman)|Bob Jones]], who made good on a threat to create his own party in protest at Muldoon's economic policies. In 1983 the [[New Zealand Party]] was formed by Jones and took a significant share of the vote at the [[1984 New Zealand general election|1984 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/national-party/page-2|title=Story: National Party Page 2 \u2013 Consensus and division|publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=13 July 2012|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Economic recession and wage and price freeze ====\nWith Think Big failing to deliver on its promise, Muldoon imposed an [[incomes policy]]: a freeze on wages and most prices (items excluded included fresh meat, frozen meat, items sold at auction and \"women's fashion clothing other than standard lines\"<ref name=\"Beattie\">{{cite web |last1=Beattie |first1=David |authorlink1=David Beattie |title=The Price Freeze Regulations 1982 |url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/download.cgi/cgi-bin/download.cgi/download/nz/legis/num_reg/pfr1982235.pdf |accessdate=20 November 2019 |date=April 1982}}</ref>), interest rates and dividends across the country in April 1982.<ref name=\"Beattie\"/> Against this he offered a \"sweetener\" of a tax cut which cost the New Zealand treasury approximately a billion New Zealand dollars.{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=42}} Ultimately the Wage and Price Freeze, which had been intended only to last for a year, remained in force for nearly two years and was repealed by the incoming Labour Government. Years later, Muldoon admitted that the freeze was a political mistake.\n\nThe second recession during Muldoon's premiership hit in September 1982.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" /> New Zealand's economy contracted again by 3% and unemployment hit 5.1% by 1983, and net emigration remained high.<ref name=\"dol unemployment\" />\n\n====Falklands War====\nIn 1982, Muldoon's government supported the British in the [[Falklands War]]. While New Zealand did not directly participate in the conflict, Muldoon undertook to send the frigates [[HMNZS Canterbury (F-421)|HMNZS ''Canterbury'']] and [[HMNZS Waikato (F-55)|HMNZS ''Waikato'']] to the Indian Ocean to relieve Royal Navy frigates, so that they could in their turn deploy in the conflict. New Zealand also broke off its diplomatic relations with Argentina. In defence of his support for the war, Muldoon wrote an article that was published in ''[[The Times]]'', entitled \"Why we Stand by our Mother Country\":\n\n<blockquote>We are a free and independent nation but in time of trouble we stand with our mother country...New Zealand's decision to break off diplomatic relations with Argentina over the Falklands, immediately after Britain had done so, was not because of Britain's support on the sporting issue. The reason goes much deeper than that. It is in the context of the statement made by a Labour Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1939: \"Where Britain goes, we go.\" We see the Falklands as British territory and the Falklands Islanders as subjects of our Queen. We live at the end of the line and we know the feeling of isolation...With the Falklands Islands, it is family. Historically, Britain has so often on great occasions thrown up the leader that the occasion demanded. I regard Margaret Thatcher as one of the finest and straightest politicians I have ever met...In 1939 we learned the folly of appeasement. A great catastrophe was the price that was paid. The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased. New Zealand will back Britain all the way.<ref>{{cite news|last=Muldoon|first=Robert|title=Why we stand with our mother country|publisher=The Times|date=20 May 1982|page=14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the House of Commons [[Margaret Thatcher]] responded by saying that \"The New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support of this country, of the Falkland Islanders and of the rule of liberty and the rule of law\".<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1982/may/20/engagements \"House of Commons PQs\", 20 May 1982]</ref>\n\n====Closer Economic Relations====\n[[File:Malcolm Fraser & Robert Muldoon (17473395099).jpg|thumb|Muldoon and Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]], meeting in 1978 for a Regional Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney]]\nMuldoon initiated a [[Closer Economic Relations]] (CER) free trade agreement with Australia to liberalise trade, which came into effect from New Year's Day 1982.

On 14 June 1984, a visibly drunk{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=375}} Muldoon called a [[1984 New Zealand general election|snap election]] for 14 July that same year; historians noted the unfortunate coincidence with [[Bastille Day]].<ref name=nzhistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/robert-muldoon |title=Robert Muldoon |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2010 }}</ref> A journalist commented that a one-month election campaign would not give Muldoon much time to which Muldoon replied, audibly slurring his words, \"It doesn't give my opponents much time to run up to an election, does it?\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLDve40cxlk</ref> Six days before the election, a televised leader's debate was held between Muldoon and [[David Lange]] where Muldoon finished the debate by saying \"I love you, Mr Lange\", a sign of defeat by Muldoon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Two Titans: Muldoon, Lange and Leadership|last=Johansson|first=Jon|publisher=Dunmore Publishing|year=2005|isbn=1-877399-01-9|location=Wellington, New Zealand|pages=}}</ref> Muldoon was heavily defeated by [[David Lange]]'s resurgent Labour Party, which won 56 seats to National's 37 with massive [[vote splitting]] caused by the [[New Zealand Party]] in particular. Muldoon's drunkenness when announcing the election date led to it being known as the \"schnapps election\".<ref name=nzhistory/>\n\nIt is a strong convention in New Zealand politics that a prime minister does not [[dropping the writ|ask for an early election]] unless he or she cannot govern, or unless they need to seek the electorate's endorsement on a matter of national importance (as was the case in [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). Muldoon justified the snap election because he felt Waring's revolt impeded his ability to govern. Indeed, it was obvious that Muldoon was finding it hard to pass financial measures with [[neo-liberal]] rebels like [[Ruth Richardson]] and [[Derek Quigley]] voting against the Government on certain issues.{{sfn|Bohan|2004|p=95}} However, Waring said that she would not have denied Muldoon confidence or [[Loss of Supply|supply]].  This has led historians to question Muldoon's excuse for calling a snap election, since he still would have had the constitutional means to govern.\n\n====Foreign exchange and constitutional crises====\n{{Main|1984 New Zealand constitutional crisis}}\nA final controversy occurred during the course of the election and transfer of government: during early 1984 [[Roderick Deane]], then Deputy Governor of the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]], became concerned that the [[New Zealand dollar]] (which had a fixed exchange-rate to the US dollar) had become significantly overvalued and was vulnerable to currency speculation on the financial markets in the event of a \"significant political event\".{{sfn|Russell|1996|p=69}} This was exacerbated by media speculation following a leak that an incoming Labour administration would be likely to significantly devalue the NZ dollar upon election. The Reserve Bank counselled Muldoon that the dollar should be devalued. Muldoon ignored the advice, owing to his belief that it would hurt poor New Zealanders in the medium term, and in June 1984 announced the snap election mentioned above which, as predicted, caused an immediate run on the dollar.{{sfn|Gustafson|2000|p=388\u2013389}}\n\nFollowing the election the controversy became a [[constitutional crisis]]: Muldoon refused to do as the incoming government instructed, causing the currency crisis to worsen.

However, he continued to openly agitate against McLay, refusing to withdraw into an \"elder statesman\" role as McLay wanted. The relationship between the two bottomed out when Muldoon criticised the entire party leadership, forcing McLay to demote him to the lowest rank in the National caucus.\n\nMuldoon continued to undermine McLay until 1986, when McLay was ousted in turn by his own deputy (and Muldoon's preferred candidate), [[Jim Bolger]], who had served as Minister of Labour for the latter half of Muldoon's term as Prime Minister.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on September 17, 1997. In the episode, [[List of South Park families#Grampa Marsh|Grandpa Marvin]] tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, while the parents of South Park protest the foul-mouthed cartoon ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]''. [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives to kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and presents a warning to Grandpa Marvin against forcing others to help him commit suicide.\n\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. The episode, along with the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show, were inspired by early criticism that ''South Park'' was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against [[censorship]] and addresses the morality and ethics of [[euthanasia]].\n\n\"Death\" was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season. The episode's plot heavily influenced the screenplay of the 1999 film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', which also involves South Park parents protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. In addition to Terrance and Phillip, the episode introduced recurring characters Grandpa Marsh and [[List of South Park families#Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] (then known as Carol), [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s mother, while Kenny's father [[Stuart McCormick]] appears as an unnamed character with a cameo in his debut appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[List of South Park families#The Marshes|Marsh family]] celebrates [[Grampa Marsh]]'s 102nd birthday, but he is tired of living and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, but Stan refuses because he fears he might get in trouble. Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] watches the cartoon ''[[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]]'', which revolves largely around [[Flatulence humor|fart jokes]]. [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Kyle's mother]] gets outraged by the foul language and crude humor, and contacts other South Park parents to organize a boycott at the Cartoon Central headquarters in [[New York City]]. Later at school, Stan asks [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] and [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Jesus|Jesus]] whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] suffers from a bout of \"explosive diarrhea\", which spreads to others in the town, including the adults protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch ''Terrance and Phillip'' at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of [[Enya]]'s \"[[Orinoco Flow]]\". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.\n\nWhile fleeing, Stan calls his [[List of South Park families#Randy and Sharon Marsh|mother]], who is too busy protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' to listen to his problems. More than a dozen people have killed themselves against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing ''Terrance and Phillip''. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill ''him'', but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in [[limbo]].\n\n''Terrence and Phillip'' is replaced by the [[Suzanne Somers]] show ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'' which also contains obscenities. Furious about all this, the parents go back to the Cartoon Central network building to protest again. Grandpa Marvin decides to visit Africa, where over 400 people are \"naturally\" eaten by [[lion]]s every year. The episode ends with the boys laughing, and then laughing harder when Kyle farts.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Two seated men. One holds a microphone in one hand and gestures with the other.|250px|right|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote \"Death\"]]\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season of 13 episodes. Parker long wanted to feature a [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-like death character in ''South Park'' because since his childhood, Parker enjoyed drawing cartoon images of Death riding on a tricycle. This was the inspiration behind a scene in which Death inexplicably rides a tricycle while chasing the South Park boys through the streets.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\">{{cite video|people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=audio commentary|medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\nThe subplot of Kenny's diarrhea problems came from a real-life high school experience from Stone, who said students used to offer each other $20 if they would pass a note to the teacher explaining they had \"explosive diarrhea\", like Kenny did in the episode.<ref name=\"StoneComm\">{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in \"Death\" became a popular ''South Park'' poster.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\"/> \"Death\" included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future ''South Park'' episodes.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\">{{cite book |title=The South Park Episode Guide: Volume 1, Seasons 1\u20135 |last=Stall |first=Sam |year=2009 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |location=New York City |isbn= 978-0-7624-3561-6 |page=21}}</ref> During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in \"Death\" after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Stuart McCormick]], but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> The character appears again very briefly in a later episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\n==Themes==\nDuring the first few weeks of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s run, Parker and Stone received criticism from some commentators and media outlets that the series was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation, and thus must be a simple show to produce. \"Death\" was written in response to that criticism. The episode introduced [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], a comedy duo with a popular cartoon series within the ''South Park'' universe, whose show is literally nothing but a series of flatulence jokes, with even cruder animation than ''South Park'' itself.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode's script parodied parents who voiced strong opposition to ''South Park'', portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that they fail to pay attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage57\">{{cite book|last=Gossage|first=Anne|title=The Deep End of South Park|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57 57]|isbn=978-0-7864-4307-9|publisher=McFarland & Company|url=https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage218\">{{cite book|last=Savage Jr.|first=William J.|title=Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/leavingspringfie00albe/page/218 218]|isbn=0-8143-2849-0|publisher=Wayne State University Press|title-link=Leaving Springfield}}</ref> This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, \"I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids.\"<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n\"Death\" warns against such misplaced values and condemns the practice of [[censorship]], as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like ''South Park'' or ''Terrance and Phillip''.<ref name=\"Gossage57\" /> The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere.<ref name=\"Savage218\" /> The plot of \"Death\" heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, \"After about the first year of ''South Park'', [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] already wanted to make a ''South Park'' movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n\"Death\" also touches upon the issue of [[euthanasia]], and whether it is morally or ethically wrong to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage58\">Gossage, p. 58</ref> The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience it would be for Stan. This is most strongly illustrated at the end of the episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of \"natural causes\", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, \"Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n==Cultural references and impact==\n\"Death\" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Grandpa Marvin Marsh]]. Sheila and Gerald Broflovski, Kyle's parents, were named after Stone's parents, although he insists the characters are nothing like his real parents. Marvin Marsh was not based on any real-life person, but Parker and Stone wanted to create a rude and unlikeable grandfather character because they felt most elderly people were portrayed as sweet and lovable on television.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> Originally, they wanted Marvin Marsh to be known as the \"molesting grandpa\" who kept making sexual comments to Stan and attempting to play inappropriate games with him, but Comedy Central refused to allow it, which Parker said was \"probably the right call\".<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> Terrance and Phillip are loosely based on Parker and Stone themselves, and were also inspired by the [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as well as the protagonists from the [[MTV]] cartoon ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. Although \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Terrance and Phillip, Parker said the duo \"took on a life of their own\". They made frequent appearances throughout the rest of the series, and played a major role in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut''.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode refers to [[Jack Kevorkian]], the right-to-die activist best known for his advocacy of [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as \"Jack Leborkian\".

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on September 17, 1997. In the episode, [[List of South Park families#Grampa Marsh|Grandpa Marvin]] tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, while the parents of South Park protest the foul-mouthed cartoon ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]''. [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives to kill [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]], and presents a warning to Grandpa Marvin against forcing others to help him commit suicide.\n\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. The episode, along with the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show, were inspired by early criticism that ''South Park'' was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against [[censorship]] and addresses the morality and ethics of [[euthanasia]].\n\n\"Death\" was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season. The episode's plot heavily influenced the screenplay of the 1999 film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]'', which also involves South Park parents protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. In addition to Terrance and Phillip, the episode introduced recurring characters Grandpa Marsh and [[List of South Park families#Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Sheila]] (then known as Carol), [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]'s mother, while Kenny's father [[Stuart McCormick]] appears as an unnamed character with a cameo in his debut appearance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[List of South Park families#The Marshes|Marsh family]] celebrates [[Grampa Marsh]]'s 102nd birthday, but he is tired of living and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He tries to convince [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] to kill him, but Stan refuses because he fears he might get in trouble. Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] watches the cartoon ''[[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]]'', which revolves largely around [[Flatulence humor|fart jokes]]. [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Kyle's mother]] gets outraged by the foul language and crude humor, and contacts other South Park parents to organize a boycott at the Cartoon Central headquarters in [[New York City]]. Later at school, Stan asks [[Herbert Garrison|Mr. Garrison]], [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] and [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Jesus|Jesus]] whether he should help his grandpa kill himself, but they avoid discussing the issue, much to Stan's anger.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] suffers from a bout of \"explosive diarrhea\", which spreads to others in the town, including the adults protesting ''Terrance and Phillip''. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch ''Terrance and Phillip'' at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates how terrible his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of [[Enya]]'s \"[[Orinoco Flow]]\". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, [[Death (personification)|Death]] himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.\n\nWhile fleeing, Stan calls his [[List of South Park families#Randy and Sharon Marsh|mother]], who is too busy protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' to listen to his problems. More than a dozen people have killed themselves against the headquarters building. Eventually, the network agrees to take the show off the air, not because of the deaths but because of the stench of the protesters' explosive diarrhea. Meanwhile, Death continues chasing the boys, but stops in front of a television playing ''Terrance and Phillip''. Death and the boys start laughing together, but after it is taken off the air, Death angrily touches and kills Kenny. Angered, Grandpa Marvin demands that Death kill ''him'', but Death refuses. Death then brings in the spirit of Stan's great great grandfather (Marvin's grandfather), who was killed by Marvin when he was Stan's age; the ghost warns Marvin that he must die of natural causes and not place the burden of his suicide on anybody else's shoulders or else he will spend his eternity after death in [[limbo]].\n\n''Terrence and Phillip'' is replaced by the [[Suzanne Somers]] show ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'' which also contains obscenities. Furious about all this, the parents go back to the Cartoon Central network building to protest again. Grandpa Marvin decides to visit Africa, where over 400 people are \"naturally\" eaten by [[lion]]s every year. The episode ends with the boys laughing, and then laughing harder when Kyle farts.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=Two seated men. One holds a microphone in one hand and gestures with the other.|250px|right|''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] wrote \"Death\"]]\n\"Death\" was written and directed by series co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]]. It was the last of the original six ''South Park'' episodes ordered by Comedy Central before the network committed to a full season of 13 episodes. Parker long wanted to feature a [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-like death character in ''South Park'' because since his childhood, Parker enjoyed drawing cartoon images of Death riding on a tricycle. This was the inspiration behind a scene in which Death inexplicably rides a tricycle while chasing the South Park boys through the streets.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\">{{cite video|people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=audio commentary|medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\nThe subplot of Kenny's diarrhea problems came from a real-life high school experience from Stone, who said students used to offer each other $20 if they would pass a note to the teacher explaining they had \"explosive diarrhea\", like Kenny did in the episode.<ref name=\"StoneComm\">{{Cite video | people=[[Matt Stone|Stone, Matt]] |date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Death\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref> The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in \"Death\" became a popular ''South Park'' poster.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\"/> \"Death\" included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future ''South Park'' episodes.<ref name=\"EpGuide21\">{{cite book |title=The South Park Episode Guide: Volume 1, Seasons 1\u20135 |last=Stall |first=Sam |year=2009 |publisher=[[Running Press]] |location=New York City |isbn= 978-0-7624-3561-6 |page=21}}</ref> During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although such images would be allowed in future episodes.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in \"Death\" after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Stuart McCormick]], but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> The character appears again very briefly in a later episode, \"[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]\".\n\n==Themes==\nDuring the first few weeks of ''South Park''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s run, Parker and Stone received criticism from some commentators and media outlets that the series was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation, and thus must be a simple show to produce. \"Death\" was written in response to that criticism. The episode introduced [[List of supporting characters on South Park#Terrance and Phillip|Terrance and Phillip]], a comedy duo with a popular cartoon series within the ''South Park'' universe, whose show is literally nothing but a series of flatulence jokes, with even cruder animation than ''South Park'' itself.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode's script parodied parents who voiced strong opposition to ''South Park'', portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that they fail to pay attention to what is actually going on in their children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the ''Terrance and Phillip'' show.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage57\">{{cite book|last=Gossage|first=Anne|title=The Deep End of South Park|year=2009|page=[https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57 57]|isbn=978-0-7864-4307-9|publisher=McFarland & Company|url=https://archive.org/details/deependofsouthpa00lesl/page/57}}</ref><ref name=\"Savage218\">{{cite book|last=Savage Jr.|first=William J.|title=Leaving Springfield: The Simpsons and the Possibility of Oppositional Culture|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/leavingspringfie00albe/page/218 218]|isbn=0-8143-2849-0|publisher=Wayne State University Press|title-link=Leaving Springfield}}</ref> This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, \"I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids.\"<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" />\n\n\"Death\" warns against such misplaced values and condemns the practice of [[censorship]], as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like ''South Park'' or ''Terrance and Phillip''.<ref name=\"Gossage57\" /> The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere.<ref name=\"Savage218\" /> The plot of \"Death\" heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting ''Terrance and Phillip'' due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, \"After about the first year of ''South Park'', [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] already wanted to make a ''South Park'' movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model just because we liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n\"Death\" also touches upon the issue of [[euthanasia]], and whether it is morally or ethically wrong to commit suicide.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /><ref name=\"Gossage58\">Gossage, p. 58</ref> The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience it would be for Stan. This is most strongly illustrated at the end of the episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of \"natural causes\", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, \"Basically, it is OK to kill yourself, but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip.\"<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\n==Cultural references and impact==\n\"Death\" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were [[Sheila Broflovski]] and [[Grandpa Marvin Marsh]]. Sheila and Gerald Broflovski, Kyle's parents, were named after Stone's parents, although he insists the characters are nothing like his real parents. Marvin Marsh was not based on any real-life person, but Parker and Stone wanted to create a rude and unlikeable grandfather character because they felt most elderly people were portrayed as sweet and lovable on television.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> Originally, they wanted Marvin Marsh to be known as the \"molesting grandpa\" who kept making sexual comments to Stan and attempting to play inappropriate games with him, but Comedy Central refused to allow it, which Parker said was \"probably the right call\".<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" /> Terrance and Phillip are loosely based on Parker and Stone themselves, and were also inspired by the [[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy & Scratchy]] characters from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as well as the protagonists from the [[MTV]] cartoon ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''. Although \"Death\" marked the first appearance of Terrance and Phillip, Parker said the duo \"took on a life of their own\". They made frequent appearances throughout the rest of the series, and played a major role in ''South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut''.<ref name=\"ParkerComm\" />\n\nThe episode refers to [[Jack Kevorkian]], the right-to-die activist best known for his advocacy of [[Assisted suicide|physician-assisted suicide]], although Kyle mistakenly refers to him as \"Jack Leborkian\". When ''Terrance and Phillip'' is cancelled in \"Death\", it is replaced by ''[[She's the Sheriff]]'', a sitcom starring actress [[Suzanne Somers]].<ref name=\"EpGuide21\" /> The Cartoon Central network in \"Death\" is based on Comedy Central, the real-life television network that broadcasts ''South Park''. John Warsog, the man who runs Cartoon Central in \"Death\", is based on [[Doug Herzog]], the Comedy Central executive who was responsible for bringing ''South Park'' to the network. Herzog was excited to be featured in the episode and enjoyed the portrayal.<ref name=\"StoneComm\" /> During one scene, Stan's grandfather locks him in a room and plays music by the Irish vocalist [[Enya]] as a form of torture to show Stan what it's like to be his age, and convince Stan to kill him.

''The Rise and Fall of an American Army''. Presidio Press, 1985. p. 186.</ref> At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division's commander, [[Major General]] [[Alexander Patch]], requested that the new unit be known as the ''Americal Division''\u2014the name being a contraction of '''\"American, New Caledonian Division\"'''. This was unusual, as all other U.S. divisions are known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the division had a mixed record.

The French objected to the arrangement and, increasingly worried about Japanese invasion being attracted by the airfield, demanded additional American forces.\n\nWith pressing needs to build up defenses in Hawaii and Australia, Army planners decided to put together a force rather than commit an already organized division. The regiments available through the reorganization of divisions along with other elements made available a force of about 15,000 men. This force, designated Task Force 6814 and often mentioned as Poppy Force (New Caledonia was code named Poppy), under Brigadier General [[Alexander Patch|Alexander M. Patch, Jr.]] had the elements of a division and more in its composition. For example, there was a brigade headquarters from the 26th Division, two infantry regiments and a field artillery regiment along with support elements augmented by a battalion of light tanks, antiaircraft and coast artillery regiments and a pursuit squadron. The force's mission was to hold New Caledonia.  It was an independent command, directly under the War Department in Washington.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nWithin two weeks, despite an urgent need of shipping elsewhere and at the cost of delaying and rearranging schedules elsewhere and consultations at the head of state level, Task Force 6814 along with some 4,000 troops destined for Australia were assembled in the largest single troop convoy up until that time, designated BT-200 and totaling over 20,000 troops aboard seven transports,.<ref group=note>The transports were: [[SS Argentina (1929)|''Argentina'']] (1929) {{GRT|20,614}}, [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/que_pasa/Retirement.html ''Cristobal'' (1939) {{GRT|10,021}}], [[USAT J.

General Patch, preceding the force by air, had arrived on 5 March with news for the French that American forces were underway. Despite having no early prospect of reinforcements, another infantry regiment arrived in April, along with the authority to organize an infantry division from elements of the overall force and, in May, the Americal Division was organized.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nOn 14 March 1942, two days after the task force later to be known as the Americal Division landed in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, the 182nd Infantry was detailed to provide a special unit to be called Force A for advance occupation and outpost of the New Hebrides, a group of islands lying directly across the supply to United States.\n\nAssigned to this duty were companies L and M and attached elements from Headquarters Company, Service Company, the Medical Detachment plus a platoon of the 101st Engineers.\n\nThe total strength being in the vicinity of 480 men was under the command of Brigadier General Rose.

No retreat was possible, no reinforcements could be relied on. Supply was unreliable and limited.\n\nOn 28 March 1942, a unit of Force A left an isolated coconut plantation called Euralia for Port Havanah with two 2nd lieutenants and 22 men on a small auxiliary sailboat with equipment and 10 days' rations to begin their 'guerrilla' action by gathering the native headhunters and plantation workers from the nearby islands as reinforcements.{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division\n|date=August 1942-May 1943\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Task Force 6814 (including attached Division Surgeon's Office)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 51st Infantry Brigade\n* 132nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 164th Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 182nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 1 platoon, 39th Military Police Company\n* 26th Signal Company\n* Headquarters, American Division Artillery (activated 26 October 1942)\n* 221st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm)\n* 223rd Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) (relieved from division 26 February 1943)\n* 245th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 101st Medical Regiment (less two companies and Division Surgeon's Office)\n}}\n===Guadalcanal===\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nIn contrast to several other US Army divisions in the [[Pacific War]], soldiers in the Americal division received extensive weapons training as well as company- and battalion-level exercises in jungle terrain while at [[New Caledonia]]. Under the command of General Patch, the Americal Division was the first US Army unit to be sent to [[Guadalcanal]].  Largely because of transport constraints, the Americal arrived piecemeal and was fed into combat alongside the battle-hardened and exhausted [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]], which it eventually relieved. Its soldiers were quick to assimilate from the Marines on Guadalcanal lessons on battle tactics against Japanese forces. Americal casualties were consequently less than what might be expected.\n\nThe 164th Infantry Regiment landed on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments, as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division.  The Regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II as part of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties; the 164th also supported and participated in Marine attacks. The First Marine Division's commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers' stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated \"an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.\" In addition, General Vandegrift took the unusual step of awarding Lt. Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles. The 164th was then occasionally referred to as the '164th Marines' due to their special relationship with the Marines on Guadalcanal.\n\nIn November the 164th took part in the offensive across the [[Matanikau River]]. Other elements of the division arrived piecemeal in the last few weeks of 1942.\n\nIn January 1943, the 132nd Infantry Regiment of the division took Hill 27 and 31 of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] complex. The division later participated in offensives to sweep Guadalcanal of remaining Japanese resistance. After the last Japanese defenders were killed, captured, or evacuated from the island, the division was relieved on 9 February 1943.\n\nDespite its ad-hoc formation, the Americal Division fought well at Guadalcanal. The 164th Regiment took part in repulsing a major Japanese offensive in October 1942, while the 132nd Regiment, along with the 25th Infantry Division assaulted the highly fortified Japanese Gifu defensive complex at [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] in January 1943. Historians describe the Americal Division as the most effective of all the US Army divisions in that campaign. Following the withdrawal of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the division continued operations on Guadalcanal as part of the [[XIV Corps (United States)|U.S. XIV Corps]] with the 25th Infantry Division (who later earned their 'Tropic Lightning' nickname here) and the 2nd Marine Division (Arrived earlier as reinforcements to the 1st MarDiv) until all of the Japanese resistance had ended.\n\n===Bougainville===\n{{Main| Bougainville campaign (1943\u201345)}}\n{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division <ref>https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/infcomp.html Component Elements of the Infantry Divisions in World War II</ref>\n|date=May 1943-December 1945\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, Americal Division\n* [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Americal Division Artillery\n** 221st Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n** 245th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer]] Combat Battalion\n* 121st [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical]] Battalion\n* 21st Cavalry [[Reconnaissance]] Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, Americal Division\n** Headquarters Company, Americal Division\n** 721st [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance]] Light Maintenance Company\n** 125th [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster]] Company\n** 26th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal]] Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 182nd [[Counterintelligence Corps]] Detachment\n}}\nThe division next moved to the [[Fiji]] Islands, beginning 5 March 1943, to assume the defense of the main island of [[Viti Levu]] and to engage in extensive training.\n\nDuring the period 25 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 the Americal Division landed on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], relieving the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. They were given the task (alongside the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] and a Marine defense battalion) of holding and extending the right half of a previously established perimeter.\n\nWarned by intelligence, they met a massive and sustained Japanese counter-attack, which began on 7 March 1944. Despite ample warning and thorough defensive preparations, the battle soon degenerated into a bitter, close-quarters infantry affair, with artillery restricted by the need to avoid friendly troops and tanks unable to reach the scene. The 37th and Americal Divisions stood firm, and by 25 March, the Japanese were forced to retreat. It was the last Japanese ground offensive in the South Pacific.\n\nThe division went on the offensive in March 1944, driving the Japanese east of [[Mavavia River]], 7\u20139 April 1944, and seizing numerous strategic hill bases during the remainder of the month. Training and long-range patrol activity continued until 30 November 1944 when the division was relieved.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main| Battle of Leyte}}\nOn 8 January 1945, the division began movement to [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Samar Island|Samar]], to take part in cleaning out remaining Japanese forces on those islands, and to invade [[Biri, Northern Samar|Biri]], [[Capul]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], and [[Burias (island)|Burias]]. On Leyte, the division was relieved on 13 March 1945 and then landed on [[Cebu Island|Cebu]] on 26 March, and seized the city and airfield by 28 March. Divisional combat teams made landings on [[Bohol Island|Bohol]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], and [[Mindanao Island|Mindanao]], where they cleared out pockets of resisting Japanese until 17 June when ordered to return to Cebu, arriving on 25 June. The Americal Division added by the newly local Filipino troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the recognized guerrillas for the liberated in Visayas and Mindanao against the Japanese.\n\nTraining continued on Cebu for the proposed invasion of Japan, but the Japanese surrendered on 14 August 1945.

Task Force Oregon operated in close cooperation with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] in the I Corps Military Region. As more US Army units arrived in Vietnam the two divisional brigades were released back to their parent organizations and two arriving separate brigades were assigned to Task Force Oregon, which was in turn re-designated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). The division was composed of the [[11th Infantry Brigade (United States)|11th]], 196th, and [[198th Infantry Brigade (United States)|198th Light Infantry Brigades]] and divisional support units. Both the 11th and 198th brigades were newly formed units.\n\nThe Americal, in Vietnam, suffered an important defeat at the [[Battle of Kham Duc]] but gave a solid performance during the [[Tet Offensive]], the [[Battle of Lo Giang]] and the [[Battle of Landing Zone Center|Battle of Landing Zone Center/Hill 352]].

The anchor refers to the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (Navy) awarded the division for Guadalcanal. The red arrowhead and Philippine sun stand for the assault landing, Southern Philippines, and the award of the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Philippines)|Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]] (7 October 1944 to 4 July 1945). The unsheathed sword with point to top refers to Vietnam where the division was active. In view of the division's origin and outstanding service in World War II and inasmuch as it was one of the few U.S. Army divisions to bear a name instead of a number, the division's former name \"Americal\" has been taken as a motto, the association with that name being both inspirational and of historical military significance.<ref name=tioh/>\n\n==Commanders==\nMG [[Alexander M.

This division was the only division formed outside of United States territory during World War II (a distinction it would repeat when reformed during the Vietnam War).<ref>Stanton, Shelby. ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army''. Presidio Press, 1985. p. 186.</ref> At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division's commander, [[Major General]] [[Alexander Patch]], requested that the new unit be known as the ''Americal Division''\u2014the name being a contraction of '''\"American, New Caledonian Division\"'''. This was unusual, as all other U.S. divisions are known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the division had a mixed record. It combined solid service in numerous battles and campaigns with the [[My Lai massacre]], which was committed by a platoon of the division's subordinate 11th Infantry Brigade, led by Lieutenant [[William Calley]].\n\nThe Division also had another setback on the early morning of 28 March 1971, Vietcong sapper commandos sneaked into [[Battle of FSB Mary Ann|FSB Mary Ann]], proceeded to throw explosives and tear gas, knife sleeping soldiers and blowing up key infrastructure delaying rescue.

The French objected to the arrangement and, increasingly worried about Japanese invasion being attracted by the airfield, demanded additional American forces.\n\nWith pressing needs to build up defenses in Hawaii and Australia, Army planners decided to put together a force rather than commit an already organized division. The regiments available through the reorganization of divisions along with other elements made available a force of about 15,000 men. This force, designated Task Force 6814 and often mentioned as Poppy Force (New Caledonia was code named Poppy), under Brigadier General [[Alexander Patch|Alexander M. Patch, Jr.]] had the elements of a division and more in its composition. For example, there was a brigade headquarters from the 26th Division, two infantry regiments and a field artillery regiment along with support elements augmented by a battalion of light tanks, antiaircraft and coast artillery regiments and a pursuit squadron. The force's mission was to hold New Caledonia.  It was an independent command, directly under the War Department in Washington.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nWithin two weeks, despite an urgent need of shipping elsewhere and at the cost of delaying and rearranging schedules elsewhere and consultations at the head of state level, Task Force 6814 along with some 4,000 troops destined for Australia were assembled in the largest single troop convoy up until that time, designated BT-200 and totaling over 20,000 troops aboard seven transports,.<ref group=note>The transports were: [[SS Argentina (1929)|''Argentina'']] (1929) {{GRT|20,614}}, [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/que_pasa/Retirement.html ''Cristobal'' (1939) {{GRT|10,021}}], [[USAT J.

General Patch, preceding the force by air, had arrived on 5 March with news for the French that American forces were underway. Despite having no early prospect of reinforcements, another infantry regiment arrived in April, along with the authority to organize an infantry division from elements of the overall force and, in May, the Americal Division was organized.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nOn 14 March 1942, two days after the task force later to be known as the Americal Division landed in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, the 182nd Infantry was detailed to provide a special unit to be called Force A for advance occupation and outpost of the New Hebrides, a group of islands lying directly across the supply to United States.\n\nAssigned to this duty were companies L and M and attached elements from Headquarters Company, Service Company, the Medical Detachment plus a platoon of the 101st Engineers.\n\nThe total strength being in the vicinity of 480 men was under the command of Brigadier General Rose. That a brigadier general should be placed in command of two infantry rifle companies indicated the degree of importance, and hazard, that G.H.Q. placed upon the mission.<ref>comment from the source, a personal diary of 2nd Lt. R.M. Whittet 1941\u20131944 A 330391</ref> Mainly though it was so he could deal directly with the highest local French authorities.\n\nThe men were assembled and told that Force A and 50 Australians held the most advanced outpost of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific along with Australian forces at Port Moresby, Papua. No retreat was possible, no reinforcements could be relied on. Supply was unreliable and limited.\n\nOn 28 March 1942, a unit of Force A left an isolated coconut plantation called Euralia for Port Havanah with two 2nd lieutenants and 22 men on a small auxiliary sailboat with equipment and 10 days' rations to begin their 'guerrilla' action by gathering the native headhunters and plantation workers from the nearby islands as reinforcements.{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division\n|date=August 1942-May 1943\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Task Force 6814 (including attached Division Surgeon's Office)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 51st Infantry Brigade\n* 132nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 164th Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 182nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 1 platoon, 39th Military Police Company\n* 26th Signal Company\n* Headquarters, American Division Artillery (activated 26 October 1942)\n* 221st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm)\n* 223rd Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) (relieved from division 26 February 1943)\n* 245th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 101st Medical Regiment (less two companies and Division Surgeon's Office)\n}}\n===Guadalcanal===\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nIn contrast to several other US Army divisions in the [[Pacific War]], soldiers in the Americal division received extensive weapons training as well as company- and battalion-level exercises in jungle terrain while at [[New Caledonia]]. Under the command of General Patch, the Americal Division was the first US Army unit to be sent to [[Guadalcanal]].  Largely because of transport constraints, the Americal arrived piecemeal and was fed into combat alongside the battle-hardened and exhausted [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]], which it eventually relieved. Its soldiers were quick to assimilate from the Marines on Guadalcanal lessons on battle tactics against Japanese forces. Americal casualties were consequently less than what might be expected.\n\nThe 164th Infantry Regiment landed on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments, as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division.  The Regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II as part of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties; the 164th also supported and participated in Marine attacks. The First Marine Division's commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers' stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated \"an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.\" In addition, General Vandegrift took the unusual step of awarding Lt. Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles. The 164th was then occasionally referred to as the '164th Marines' due to their special relationship with the Marines on Guadalcanal.\n\nIn November the 164th took part in the offensive across the [[Matanikau River]]. Other elements of the division arrived piecemeal in the last few weeks of 1942.\n\nIn January 1943, the 132nd Infantry Regiment of the division took Hill 27 and 31 of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] complex. The division later participated in offensives to sweep Guadalcanal of remaining Japanese resistance. After the last Japanese defenders were killed, captured, or evacuated from the island, the division was relieved on 9 February 1943.\n\nDespite its ad-hoc formation, the Americal Division fought well at Guadalcanal. The 164th Regiment took part in repulsing a major Japanese offensive in October 1942, while the 132nd Regiment, along with the 25th Infantry Division assaulted the highly fortified Japanese Gifu defensive complex at [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] in January 1943. Historians describe the Americal Division as the most effective of all the US Army divisions in that campaign. Following the withdrawal of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the division continued operations on Guadalcanal as part of the [[XIV Corps (United States)|U.S. XIV Corps]] with the 25th Infantry Division (who later earned their 'Tropic Lightning' nickname here) and the 2nd Marine Division (Arrived earlier as reinforcements to the 1st MarDiv) until all of the Japanese resistance had ended.\n\n===Bougainville===\n{{Main| Bougainville campaign (1943\u201345)}}\n{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division <ref>https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/infcomp.html Component Elements of the Infantry Divisions in World War II</ref>\n|date=May 1943-December 1945\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, Americal Division\n* [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Americal Division Artillery\n** 221st Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n** 245th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer]] Combat Battalion\n* 121st [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical]] Battalion\n* 21st Cavalry [[Reconnaissance]] Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, Americal Division\n** Headquarters Company, Americal Division\n** 721st [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance]] Light Maintenance Company\n** 125th [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster]] Company\n** 26th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal]] Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 182nd [[Counterintelligence Corps]] Detachment\n}}\nThe division next moved to the [[Fiji]] Islands, beginning 5 March 1943, to assume the defense of the main island of [[Viti Levu]] and to engage in extensive training.\n\nDuring the period 25 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 the Americal Division landed on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], relieving the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. They were given the task (alongside the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] and a Marine defense battalion) of holding and extending the right half of a previously established perimeter.\n\nWarned by intelligence, they met a massive and sustained Japanese counter-attack, which began on 7 March 1944. Despite ample warning and thorough defensive preparations, the battle soon degenerated into a bitter, close-quarters infantry affair, with artillery restricted by the need to avoid friendly troops and tanks unable to reach the scene. The 37th and Americal Divisions stood firm, and by 25 March, the Japanese were forced to retreat. It was the last Japanese ground offensive in the South Pacific.\n\nThe division went on the offensive in March 1944, driving the Japanese east of [[Mavavia River]], 7\u20139 April 1944, and seizing numerous strategic hill bases during the remainder of the month. Training and long-range patrol activity continued until 30 November 1944 when the division was relieved.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main| Battle of Leyte}}\nOn 8 January 1945, the division began movement to [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Samar Island|Samar]], to take part in cleaning out remaining Japanese forces on those islands, and to invade [[Biri, Northern Samar|Biri]], [[Capul]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], and [[Burias (island)|Burias]]. On Leyte, the division was relieved on 13 March 1945 and then landed on [[Cebu Island|Cebu]] on 26 March, and seized the city and airfield by 28 March. Divisional combat teams made landings on [[Bohol Island|Bohol]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], and [[Mindanao Island|Mindanao]], where they cleared out pockets of resisting Japanese until 17 June when ordered to return to Cebu, arriving on 25 June. The Americal Division added by the newly local Filipino troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the recognized guerrillas for the liberated in Visayas and Mindanao against the Japanese.\n\nTraining continued on Cebu for the proposed invasion of Japan, but the Japanese surrendered on 14 August 1945. On 10 September 1945, the Americal Division landed in Japan and took part in the occupation of the [[Yokohama]]&ndash;[[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]&ndash;[[Yokosuka]] area.\n\n===Casualties===\n*'''Total battle casualties:''' 4,050<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\">Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistics and Analysis Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)</ref>\n*'''Killed in action:''' 981<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Wounded in action:''' 3,052<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Missing in action:''' 16<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Prisoner of war:''' 1<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n\n==Postwar==\nThe division returned to the United States on 21 November 1945, and was inactivated on 12 December 1945.

Its precursor, a division-sized task force known as [[Task Force Oregon]] was created in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province|Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn Province|Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn]] provinces from the 3rd Brigade of the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], the 1st Brigade of the [[101st Airborne Division]], and the [[196th Infantry Brigade (United States)|196th Light Infantry Brigade]] (all brigades that deployed separately to Vietnam in 1966). Task Force Oregon operated in close cooperation with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] in the I Corps Military Region. As more US Army units arrived in Vietnam the two divisional brigades were released back to their parent organizations and two arriving separate brigades were assigned to Task Force Oregon, which was in turn re-designated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). The division was composed of the [[11th Infantry Brigade (United States)|11th]], 196th, and [[198th Infantry Brigade (United States)|198th Light Infantry Brigades]] and divisional support units. Both the 11th and 198th brigades were newly formed units.\n\nThe Americal, in Vietnam, suffered an important defeat at the [[Battle of Kham Duc]] but gave a solid performance during the [[Tet Offensive]], the [[Battle of Lo Giang]] and the [[Battle of Landing Zone Center|Battle of Landing Zone Center/Hill 352]]. Platoon Sergeant [[Finnis McCleery]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his valiant efforts on Hill 352. Sgt. [[Alan Allen]] was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for this same battle. Both men were members of A Co. 1/6 198th. 20 men from A Company were lost in the Battle of LoGiang on 8 February 1968.

The blue color stands for infantry.<ref name=tioh/>\n\nOn the distinctive unit insignia, the blue saltire (cross of St. Andrew) alludes to New Caledonia in the Southwest Pacific where the division was created and first activated on 27 May 1942. Each of the four white stars stands for the [[Southern Cross]] constellation on its division insignia, as well as the four World War II campaigns ([[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]], [[Solomon Islands campaign|Northern Solomons]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] and [[Southern Philippines]]) in which the division participated. The anchor refers to the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (Navy) awarded the division for Guadalcanal. The red arrowhead and Philippine sun stand for the assault landing, Southern Philippines, and the award of the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Philippines)|Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]] (7 October 1944 to 4 July 1945). The unsheathed sword with point to top refers to Vietnam where the division was active. In view of the division's origin and outstanding service in World War II and inasmuch as it was one of the few U.S. Army divisions to bear a name instead of a number, the division's former name \"Americal\" has been taken as a motto, the association with that name being both inspirational and of historical military significance.<ref name=tioh/>\n\n==Commanders==\nMG [[Alexander M.

Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the town council included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Polish historian Krzysztof Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.

The OWP referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. It was banned in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\n[[File:Jewish children and their teacher, Jedwabne, 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Jewish children with their schoolteachers, [[Jedwabne]], 1938]]\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} Prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town were relatively good. At their most tense, when a Jewish woman was killed in Jedwabne and a Polish peasant in another town was killed a few days later, a rumor began that the Jedwabne Jews had taken revenge.

Karolak established a local police force, whose members included Eugeniusz Kalinowsk and Jerzy Laudanski. According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933\u20131945]]'', the town council included Eugeniusz Sliwecki, J\u00f3zef Sobutka, and J\u00f3zef Wasilewski. Karol Bardon, a translator for the Germans, may also have been a member.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=900}}\n\nThere is general agreement that German police were seen in Jedwabne on the morning of 10 July 1941, or the day before, and met with the town council.{{sfn|Persak|2011|pp=412\u2013413}} Szmuel Wasersztajn's witness statement in 1945 said that eight Gestapo men arrived on 10 July and met with the town authorities.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} Another witness said four or five Gestapo men arrived and \"they began to talk in the town hall\". \"Gestapo man\" was used to refer to any German in a black uniform, Persak writes. The witnesses said they believed the meeting had been held to discuss murdering the town's Jews.{{efn|Krzysztof Persak (2011): \"The direct perpetrators of those crimes was a sizeable group of residents of Jedwabne and neighboring villages. Those involved in the pogrom took different roles: some killed the victims with their own hands, others supervised the Jews assembled in the market square and escorted them to the execution site in the barn, while some robbed Jewish homes or simply formed a hostile crowd of onlookers. The witnesses were fairly unanimous in assigning the role of pogrom organizers to members of the temporary municipal authorities, with Mayor Karolak at the head. Probably a significant part of the massacre was performed by members of the order service subordinated to them, of which, however, we know very little.{{pb}}\"Far less clear is the role played in Jedwabne by representatives of the German occupation authorities. Undoubtedly, they fully approved and possibly inspired the murder. According to testimony of the then-messenger at the gendarmerie post, Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski, before the pogrom 'four or five Gestapo men had arrived in a cab, and they began to talk in the town hall.' In colloquial Polish, a 'cab' (''taks\u00f3wka'') denoted a motor car, and 'Gestapo man' referred to any German in a black uniform. This reference, no doubt, relates to the meeting of the temporary municipal authorities with\u2014probably\u2014functionaries of the German Security Police or Security Service (''Sicherheitspolizei'' or ''Sicherheitsdienst''), mentioned by other witnesses as well. Although accounts regarding that issue are all secondhand, their common denominator is that during that 'conference' the decision to murder the Jedwabne Jews was taken.\"{{sfn|Persak|2011|p=412}}}}\n\nThe IPN found that some Jews had been alerted by non-Jewish acquaintances the evening before that \"a collective action was being prepared against the Jews\".{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Gross writes that a leading role in the pogrom was carried out by four men, including Jerzy Lauda\u0144ski and Karol Bardo\u0144, who had earlier collaborated with the Soviet [[NKVD]] and were now trying to recast themselves as zealous collaborators with the Germans.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=75}} He also writes that no \"sustained organized activity\" could have taken place in the town without the Germans' consent.{{sfn|Gross|2001|pp=46\u201347}} Several witnesses reported seeing German photographers take pictures of the massacre. There was also speculation that the pogrom was filmed.{{sfn|Ignatiew|2002}} Polish historian Krzysztof Persak writes that the area around [[\u0141om\u017ca]] and western [[Bia\u0142ystok]] was one of the few Polish majority areas that had just undergone the cruelty of Soviet occupation since 1939. They therefore saw Germans as liberators when they arrived in 1941; paired with historical antisemitism, the conditions were right for German incitement.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<!--primary sources: Several Jewish eyewitnesses reported that the Germans were directly involved in rounding up and abusing Jews in the town square, and that they shot at Jews who tried to escape from the burning barn.
