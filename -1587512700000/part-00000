Its students and programs were transferred to [[Simon Fraser University]] to become the core of [[SFU Surrey]] and the [[School of Interactive Arts and Technology]].\n\n== Establishment ==\nThe roots of TechBC were in demand from Fraser Valley residents for a full-service university in the region.  In 1991, the Fraser Valley University Society was formed to organize public pressure towards this goal.  (In light of later events, one of its first actions was to lobby SFU president William Saywell to open a satellite campus in the region.)\n\nThe policy of both [[British Columbia Social Credit Party|Social Credit]] and [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) governments of the day was to grant degree-granting status to the existing post-secondary institutions in the region, today's [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]] and [[University of the Fraser Valley]].  By the mid-1990s, however, the ability of these institutions to keep up with rapid population growth was increasingly in question.  Of greater concern was the Fraser Valley's abysmally low university participation rate\u2014a rate that contributed to BC's ninth-place standing among Canadian provinces on this factor.\n\nPublic opinion polling and the skills-development policies of the [[Mike Harcourt]] government led the province to announce, on 2 February 1995, the establishment of a free-standing technical university, to be located on a $100 million campus in [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]].  Legislation for the new institution, Technical University of British Columbia Act, was passed in July 1997.<ref>Technical University of British Columbia Act www.cufa.bc.ca/tubc/gov30-3.htm</ref> Controversially, the ''Technical University of British Columbia Act'' did not provide for an academic senate, a standard feature of faculty curriculum control in other universities.  This, coupled with news that the new university would operate without tenure, led to a year-long boycott by the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]].\n\n== Academic programs ==\nAlthough its initial charter suggested TechBC's involvement in a range of applied fields, a pronounced shift under the [[Glen Clark]] government led it to pursue specifically high-tech program offerings, in keeping with the economic climate of the times.  The institution pursued an \"integrated learning\" approach, combining heavy use of on-line learning with mixed face-to-face course structures.\n\nAll students underwent a common, intensive first-year program called TechOne, which emphasized core artistic, technical, mathematical, and communication skills.  Students completing TechOne could continue in any of TechBC's offerings, but the TechOne program was generally not transferable to other institutions\u2014a problem that would plague the university in its student-recruitment efforts.\n\nThree program streams were offered at the university's September 1999 launch.  Perhaps the most innovative, Interactive Arts focused on the use of computers and technology in the development of art, design, and \"new media\".  The Information Technology program was conceived as a hybrid of traditional computer engineering and computer science programs.  Management and Technology was designed to integrate traditional business curriculum with content specific to the management of high-technology industries and also the technical skills required for work in that field.\n\nIn its short life, TechBC managed to recruit some high-calibre talent.  The new university scored a major coup when it hired prominent SFU computer scientist [[Tom Calvert]] as its Vice President, Research and External Relations.  Moreover, Professor Alice Mansell, a prominent academic leader and artist, joined TechBC as its first Vice President, Academic.  Mansell brought fresh ideas and management into TechBC, reorganizing TechBC's academic leadership into a non-discipline based Academic Planning and Academic Operations. She recruited Professor [[Hassan Farhangi]], an industry and academic veteran as Dean, Academic Operations, and Professor Ron Wakkary, a visionary artist, as Dean, Academic Planning. This innovative academic structure helped TechBC develop a full inter-disciplinary undergraduate program, called TechOne, and deliver components of it as the rest were being built. The success of this efficient and concurrent development was in part attributed to an innovative curriculum development and delivery workflow which Professor Farhangi developed and implemented. Other prominent names who joined TechBC later included [[Michael Gurstein]], John Bowes, Steve diPaola, [[Thecla Schiphorst]], Michael Dobson, Robert Woodbury and [[V-chip]] inventor [[Tim Collings]].\n\n== Campus ==\nAlthough the February 1995 announcement placed TechBC on provincially owned land in Cloverdale, the impracticality of that site from an urban and transportation perspective became readily apparent.  The City of Surrey offered a {{convert|12|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land in [[Whalley, British Columbia|Whalley]], the economic centre of the municipality, leading to a July 1998 announcement that TechBC would receive an urban campus adjacent to [[Surrey Place Mall]] instead of the cow pasture previously announced.\n\nMeanwhile, however, the property-development arm of the provincial auto insurer, the [[Insurance Corporation of British Columbia]] (ICBC), had quietly acquired the mall next door.  ICBC president and NDP operative [[Robert Arthur Williams|Bob Williams]] approached the provincial government with an ambitious scheme: the construction of a three-storey galleria above the mall and a twenty-storey landmark office tower, designed by Vancouver architect [[Bing Thom]].  TechBC would occupy the galleria and tower podium, while ICBC would move its corporate offices to the tower.  The scheme was seen not only as revitalization for the depressed urban core of Surrey, but as a way to take the new university's capital costs \"off-book,\" by financing them through ICBC, which would charge an annual rent to the university.  Instead of the $100 million in capital costs promised by the government, TechBC was obliged to pay $426,000 a month to ICBC for its campus, an amount totalling over $178 million over the 25-year term after additional charges were included.  While many in the university expressed concern over this arrangement, the final decisions\u2014and the ultimate source of virtually all the university's funding\u2014rested in Victoria.\n\nThe building project was ultimately a major liability for TechBC.  The incoming [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] government of [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] used the project to smear the NDP, which it trounced in the 2001 election and which was tarnished by the [[Fast Ferry Scandal|fast ferry scandal]] and other megaprojects gone wrong.  The university's lease payments also skewed comparisons with other institutions, all of which had pre-existing 'gifted' capital assets and buildings.  Delay in completion of the university's permanent facilities, occasioned by the ICBC project, also reduced the rate at which TechBC could take in students, leading to allegations that it was not meeting enrollment targets.\n\nTechBC never occupied its permanent facilities in the \"Central City\" development.  At the time of its closure in 2002, it remained in leased 'betaspace' premises in a former [[Zellers]] store at Surrey Place Mall.  In 2004, Premier Gordon Campbell announced that SFU would occupy the much-maligned facility after all.  SFU moved into the new space in September 2006.\n\n== Closure ==\nUpon taking office in 2001, the BC Liberal government initiated a \"Core Services Review\" designed to identify savings in support of a 10% cut in government expenditures.  Almost immediately, incoming Advanced Education Minister [[Shirley Bond]] initiated a review of TechBC's future.  While TechBC prepared a series of business plans, each more aggressive than the last, deputy minister Gerry Armstrong solicited proposals from other BC post-secondary institutions.  [[Simon Fraser University]] was the first to express its interest, and ultimately was best able to provide the province with a political \"win\" in the otherwise politically disastrous closure of the only university in the vote-rich Fraser Valley region.\n\nAs ultimately developed, SFU agreed to accept all existing TechBC students, and to operate a Surrey campus on a permanent basis.  It continued the Interactive Arts and Information Technology programs on the Surrey site, while the Management and Technology students were streamed into its Faculty of Business at its main campus on the [[Burnaby Mountain]].  Although the government later funded expansion plans, the initial agreement involved expansion to only 860 FTEs, a fraction of the 2353 proposed by TechBC in its final business plan.\n\nDespite last-minute rumours that TechBC would merge with [[Kwantlen University College]], the final announcement was made at a televised \"Open Cabinet\" press conference on 7 February 2002.  The government announcement compared TechBC's situation with its 1998 academic plan, ignoring the burden placed on the university with the building project and its delay in providing permanent teaching and research space.\n\nTransition arrangements proceeded quickly, and TechBC officially closed at the end of July 2002, after three waves of layoffs.  SFU ultimately hired most of the teaching staff, and some middle-level administrators and support people.  [[SFU Surrey]] opened in September 2002, initially with essentially the same campus and programs as its predecessor.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n*Trueman, John.  \"Our Time Will Come Again: Tracing the Story of the Technical University of British Columbia.\"  (2005)  {{ISBN|0-9739620-1-1}}\n*Hendrigan, H.

Instead of the $100 million in capital costs promised by the government, TechBC was obliged to pay $426,000 a month to ICBC for its campus, an amount totalling over $178 million over the 25-year term after additional charges were included.  While many in the university expressed concern over this arrangement, the final decisions\u2014and the ultimate source of virtually all the university's funding\u2014rested in Victoria.\n\nThe building project was ultimately a major liability for TechBC.  The incoming [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] government of [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] used the project to smear the NDP, which it trounced in the 2001 election and which was tarnished by the [[Fast Ferry Scandal|fast ferry scandal]] and other megaprojects gone wrong.  The university's lease payments also skewed comparisons with other institutions, all of which had pre-existing 'gifted' capital assets and buildings.  Delay in completion of the university's permanent facilities, occasioned by the ICBC project, also reduced the rate at which TechBC could take in students, leading to allegations that it was not meeting enrollment targets.\n\nTechBC never occupied its permanent facilities in the \"Central City\" development.  At the time of its closure in 2002, it remained in leased 'betaspace' premises in a former [[Zellers]] store at Surrey Place Mall.  In 2004, Premier Gordon Campbell announced that SFU would occupy the much-maligned facility after all.  SFU moved into the new space in September 2006.\n\n== Closure ==\nUpon taking office in 2001, the BC Liberal government initiated a \"Core Services Review\" designed to identify savings in support of a 10% cut in government expenditures.  Almost immediately, incoming Advanced Education Minister [[Shirley Bond]] initiated a review of TechBC's future.  While TechBC prepared a series of business plans, each more aggressive than the last, deputy minister Gerry Armstrong solicited proposals from other BC post-secondary institutions.  [[Simon Fraser University]] was the first to express its interest, and ultimately was best able to provide the province with a political \"win\" in the otherwise politically disastrous closure of the only university in the vote-rich Fraser Valley region.\n\nAs ultimately developed, SFU agreed to accept all existing TechBC students, and to operate a Surrey campus on a permanent basis.  It continued the Interactive Arts and Information Technology programs on the Surrey site, while the Management and Technology students were streamed into its Faculty of Business at its main campus on the [[Burnaby Mountain]].  Although the government later funded expansion plans, the initial agreement involved expansion to only 860 FTEs, a fraction of the 2353 proposed by TechBC in its final business plan.\n\nDespite last-minute rumours that TechBC would merge with [[Kwantlen University College]], the final announcement was made at a televised \"Open Cabinet\" press conference on 7 February 2002.  The government announcement compared TechBC's situation with its 1998 academic plan, ignoring the burden placed on the university with the building project and its delay in providing permanent teaching and research space.\n\nTransition arrangements proceeded quickly, and TechBC officially closed at the end of July 2002, after three waves of layoffs.  SFU ultimately hired most of the teaching staff, and some middle-level administrators and support people.  [[SFU Surrey]] opened in September 2002, initially with essentially the same campus and programs as its predecessor.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n*Trueman, John.  \"Our Time Will Come Again: Tracing the Story of the Technical University of British Columbia.\"  (2005)  {{ISBN|0-9739620-1-1}}\n*Hendrigan, H.

She is typically portrayed as a colossal sentient larva ([[caterpillar]]) or imago ([[moth]]), accompanied by two miniature female humanoids speaking on her behalf.

Akira Murao wrote a screenplay in 1980 entitled ''Mothra vs. Bagan'', which revolved around a shape-shifting dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earth's resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the god of peace. The screenplay was revised by [[Kazuki \u014cmori]] after the release of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture and thus would have been difficult to market overseas, unlike the more internationally recognized [[Godzilla]].<ref name=\"kalat2010.2\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=179\u2013183|edition=2nd}}</ref> With the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'', Toho sought to continue the series' newfound profitability by reintroducing familiar monsters rather than inventing new ones. Mothra was chosen as Godzilla's next antagonist on account of the character's popularity with women, who constituted the majority of cinemagoers at the time. Special effects head [[Koichi Kawakita]] co-wrote a screenplay entitled ''Godzilla vs. Gigamoth'' in 1991, which would have pitted Mothra against Godzilla and an irradiated Mothra doppelganger called Gigamoth, though this was rejected early on and replaced with the final plotline that was seen in the film ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]''. Kawakita's depiction of Mothra's adult form was given the ability to fire [[Directed-energy weapon|energy beams]], which were rendered via optical effects, and the pollen dust emitted from its wings were given a sparkling effect not seen in prior movies. During the character's transformation from larva to adult, it was initially planned to have Mothra's unfolding wings rendered through [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]], though this was scrapped on account of it not looking \"sensitive\" enough.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.4\">{{cite book |title=Japan's Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/279 279\u201385] |url=https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/279 }}</ref> Although the movie was a financial success, the Mothra props were criticized by several authors, who noted that the adult Mothra's brighter colors made it look like a \"plush toy\" and that its wings flapped less gracefully than in previous incarnations, as they were made of heavy cloth.

The original draft for ''Mothra'' called for four fairies, though Sekizawa reduced the number to two, as twins were comparatively rare in Japan, thus adding to the characters' mystique. Toho also sought to reinforce its links with [[Columbia Pictures]], by featuring the singing duo [[the Peanuts]], who had been popularized in America by Columbia Records.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=51-54}} [[Y\u016bji Koseki]] composed the song ''Mosura no uta'' (\"Song of Mothra\") for the fairies to sing when summoning Mothra.{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=109}} The song was originally sung in [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]], but there is also a later version, set to the same tune, sung in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]:\n\n{|border=\"0\"\n|+'''Mothra's Song'''\n|-\n!

This casting move was criticized by Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, who lamented the fact that the two actresses were not identical and that their singing voices were \"paper thin.\"<ref name=\"ryfle1998.4\"/> According to [[Takao Okawara]], the Cosmos scenes were among the hardest scenes he had ever filmed, as the actresses had to synchronize their movements without looking at each other.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=184-190}}\n\nIn the ''Rebirth of Mothra'' trilogy, Mothra Leo's fairies are called the {{nihongo4|'''Elias'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u30b9|Eriasu}} which consist of Moll, Lora, and their estranged sister Belvera. Moll and Lora contrast with prior adaptations because they possess separate personalities and rarely act in unison. Megumi Kobayashi was cast as Moll for all three films, Sayaka Yamaguchi as Lora for the first two films, Misato Tate as Lora for the third film and Aki Hano as Belvera for all three films.\n\n''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' does not feature Mothra's fairies, but they are given a nod in the form of a pair of twin girls wearing white clothes during the scene where Mothra flies over Tokyo. They are played by sisters [[Ai Maeda (actress)|Ai]] and [[Aki Maeda]].\n\nIn the anime trilogy direct by [[Gen Urobuchi]], the fairies are human-sized sisters named Maina and Miana.

The larval Mothra swims to Tokyo and cocoons herself around the [[Tokyo Tower]]. Upon reaching her adult form, Mothra flies to Rolisica's capital and causes widespread destruction until her priestesses are returned to her.<ref name=\"mothra1961\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', a Mothra egg appears on the coast of Japan, and is exploited as a tourist attraction. Mothra's priestesses attempt to negotiate the return of the egg to Infant Island, but are rebuffed. [[Godzilla]] attacks Japan, forcing humanity to beseech an embittered Mothra to intervene.

When the civilization created a device designed to control the Earth's climate, the Earth responded by creating the Black Mothra, Battra - which Mothra defeated, but not before the civilization was wiped out. Mothra's egg is later discovered in 1993 on Infant Island by the Marutomo real estate agency, which seeks to exploit it and Mothra's priestesses for profit. The egg hatches during a fight between Godzilla and a resurrected Battra, and the larva later attacks Tokyo in order to save its priestesses. Mothra forms a cocoon around the [[National Diet Building]], attains its adult form, then briefly fights Battra before joining forces with him in order to fight Godzilla. Battra dies in the attempt and Mothra pledges to fulfill Battra's role in preventing a meteorite from devastating the Earth in 1999.<ref name=\"GvM\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', Mothra becomes aware of [[SpaceGodzilla]]'s advance towards Earth and sends her priestesses to warn Earth of his arrival.<ref name=\"GvSG\">''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994).

This civilization was destroyed millions of years ago by the dragon Desghidorah, whom Mothra defeated. Mothra lays an egg in modern times, but is too weak to fight Desghidorah once it returns. The egg hatches and the new Mothra, a male larva named Mothra Leo, goes to protect his mother, but sadly Mothra is mortally wounded by Desghidorah while Leo is still too weak to injure the dragon.

She is defeated, but transfers her spirit to [[King Ghidorah]].<ref name=\"GMK\"/>\n\n''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' has the Mothra from the original 1961 film send her priestesses to demand that Japan dismantle the anti-Godzilla weapon [[Mechagodzilla|Kiryu]] or face destruction, as she considers the cyborg to be against the natural order, having been created using the bones of the first Godzilla. When the second Godzilla lands, Mothra attempts to fight the monster alongside Kiryu, but is killed in the process.

The markings on her wings are said to mark her as the \"Queen of the Monsters\" and that they apparently link Mothra to Godzilla, the King of the Monsters, since the eye spots on her wings are modeled after Godzilla's eyes. Within the film, she is shown to have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with Godzilla, and temporarily paralyzes Rodan with a hidden abdominal stinger. These changes make Mothra the most heavily redesigned monster in the series.\n\nMothra first appears hatching from her egg in her larval state and is calmed by Dr. Emma Russell using the ORCA [[Bioacoustics|bio-acoustics]] device, becoming docile. When eco-terrorists led by Colonel Alan Jonah arrive soon after and capture Russell, her daughter Madison and the ORCA device, Mothra retreats under a waterfall and cocoons herself, later emerging from her cocoon in her adult form and flying off. During the fight in [[Boston]], Mothra defeats Rodan and is disintegrated by King Ghidorah while protecting a fallen Godzilla. Her power is transferred to Godzilla as a result via her ashes, preventing him from suffering a nuclear meltdown and allowing him to defeat Ghidorah by achieving his burning form. During the credits, a news program speculates about the existence of a second Mothra egg, which the director later confirmed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike DoughertyVerified account |url=https://twitter.com/Mike_Dougherty/status/1136555493412024321 |title=Mike Dougherty on Twitter: \"To lay her egg. \u0111&#x;\u015a\u2039\u0111&#x;\u013d\u0161 #GodzillaMovie\u00e2\u20ac\u015a \" |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2019-06-06 |accessdate=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nA post-credits scene in ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' depicts cave paintings of [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]], Mothra and King Ghidorah.<ref name=\"KSI Cameo\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/kong-skull-island-after-credits-scene-explained/|title='Kong: Skull Island' Post-Credits Scene Explained|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|work=Collider|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' (1996) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'' (1997) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Godzilla: The Planet Eater]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'' (2019)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997-1998)\n* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1989\u2013present)\n* ''[[Sonic X]]'' (2003-2005)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] -

Mothra has appeared in several Toho ''[[tokusatsu]]'' films, most often as a recurring character in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. She is typically portrayed as a colossal sentient larva ([[caterpillar]]) or imago ([[moth]]), accompanied by two miniature female humanoids speaking on her behalf. Unlike other Toho monsters, Mothra is a largely heroic character, having been variously portrayed as a protector of her own island culture,<ref name=\"mothra1961\">''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961).

Polls taken during the early 1990s indicated that Mothra was particularly popular among women who were, at the time, the largest demographic among Japan's movie-going audience, a fact that prompted the filming of 1992's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'', which was the best-attended Toho film since ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''.{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=184-190}} [[IGN]] listed Mothra as #3 on their \"Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters\" list,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/top-10-japanese-movie-monsters?page=2|title=Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters|last=Hawker|first=Tom|work=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #7 on its \"The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time\" list.<ref>Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ \"The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time\"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n===Name===\nThe name {{nihongo|''Mothra''|\u30e2\u30b9\u30e9}} is the suffixation of \"-ra\" to the English word \"moth\"; since the Japanese language does not have [[dental fricative]]s, it is approximated \"Mosura\" in Japanese.

Akira Murao wrote a screenplay in 1980 entitled ''Mothra vs. Bagan'', which revolved around a shape-shifting dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earth's resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the god of peace. The screenplay was revised by [[Kazuki \u014cmori]] after the release of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture and thus would have been difficult to market overseas, unlike the more internationally recognized [[Godzilla]].<ref name=\"kalat2010.2\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=179\u2013183|edition=2nd}}</ref> With the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'', Toho sought to continue the series' newfound profitability by reintroducing familiar monsters rather than inventing new ones. Mothra was chosen as Godzilla's next antagonist on account of the character's popularity with women, who constituted the majority of cinemagoers at the time. Special effects head [[Koichi Kawakita]] co-wrote a screenplay entitled ''Godzilla vs. Gigamoth'' in 1991, which would have pitted Mothra against Godzilla and an irradiated Mothra doppelganger called Gigamoth, though this was rejected early on and replaced with the final plotline that was seen in the film ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]''. Kawakita's depiction of Mothra's adult form was given the ability to fire [[Directed-energy weapon|energy beams]], which were rendered via optical effects, and the pollen dust emitted from its wings were given a sparkling effect not seen in prior movies. During the character's transformation from larva to adult, it was initially planned to have Mothra's unfolding wings rendered through [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]], though this was scrapped on account of it not looking \"sensitive\" enough.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.4\">{{cite book |title=Japan's Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/279 279\u201385] |url=https://archive.org/details/japansfavoritemo0000ryfl/page/279 }}</ref> Although the movie was a financial success, the Mothra props were criticized by several authors, who noted that the adult Mothra's brighter colors made it look like a \"plush toy\" and that its wings flapped less gracefully than in previous incarnations, as they were made of heavy cloth. The Mothra puppet's immobile chicken-like feet and the lack of undulation in the larva prop's movements were also commented on as being inferior to the effects seen in 1960s Mothra movies.<ref name=\"ryfle1998.4\"/> Criticism was also leveled at Mothra's altered origin story, which portrayed her as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], thus dampening the character's motivation for protecting Earth.<ref name=\"kalat2010.3\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=184\u201390|edition=2nd}}</ref> The character's newfound popularity nevertheless prompted Toho to produce ''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' in 1996.<ref>David Milne, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/okawar3.htm \"Takao Okawara Interview III\"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995)</ref>\n\nFor ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', director [[Sh\u016bsuke Kaneko]] had originally planned on using [[Anguirus]] as one of Godzilla's antagonists, but was pressured by Toho chairman [[Isao Matsuoka]] to use the more recognizable and profitable Mothra,<ref name=\"kaneko\">Ed Godziszewski and Norman England, \"Interview with Shusuke Kaneko\", ''Japanese Giants'' #9 (June 2002)</ref> as the previous film in the franchise, ''[[Godzilla x Megaguirus]]'', which featured an original and unfamiliar antagonist, was a box office and critical failure.<ref name=\"kalat2010.4\">{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland & Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=238\u201342|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nFor 2003's ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', special effects director Eiichi Asada sought to model Mothra directly on her appearance in the original 1961 film and to keep optical effects to a minimum. As with ''Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah'', the adult Mothra was given mobile legs, though they were made to constantly move, as it was felt that the prop stopped looking realistic once they became immobile. Creature designer Shinichi Wakasa had initially wanted Mothra's wings to have the angular design seen in ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'', though the prop was ultimately given the wing shape seen in the 1960s movies.<ref>\"Godzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo SOS production report - The men behind the monsters discuss the latest Godzilla film\", ''Uchusen'' #108 (Asahi Sonorama) (October 22, 2003)</ref>\n\n===Mothra's fairies===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Shobijin\n| series      = [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla film series]]\n| image       = File:Mosura trailer - shobijin.png\n| caption     = \n| first       = ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961)\n| last       = ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'' (2019)\n| creator     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]]{{sfn|Ryfle|Godziszewski|2009|loc=33:44}}\n* [[Shinichiro Nakamura]]\n* [[Yoshie Hotta]]\n* [[Takehiko Fukanaga]]\n}}\n| portrayer   = <small>Emi It\u014d and Yumi It\u014d{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=101}}<br />Yuko Okada and Yoko Okada{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|p=137}}<br />Keiko Imamura and Sayaka Osawa{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=184}}<br />Megumi Kobayashi<ref name=\"RoM\"/><ref name=\"RoMII\"/><ref name=\"RoMIII\"/> and Sayaka Yamaguchi<ref name=\"RoM\"/><ref name=\"RoMII\"/>/Misato Tate<ref name=\"RoMIII\"/><br />[[Masami Nagasawa]] and [[Chihiro Otsuka]]{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=247}}{{sfn|Kalat|2010|p=249}}<br>[[Zhang Ziyi]]<ref name=\"2019Twins\" /><ref name=\"SRTwins\" />\n| alias       = Cosmos<br/>Elias\n}}\nMothra is usually accompanied by tiny twin female [[Fairy|fairies]], which [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] termed {{nihongo4|'''Shobijin'''|\u5c0f\u7f8e\u4eba}}, meaning \"little beauties\".

Moll and Lora contrast with prior adaptations because they possess separate personalities and rarely act in unison. Megumi Kobayashi was cast as Moll for all three films, Sayaka Yamaguchi as Lora for the first two films, Misato Tate as Lora for the third film and Aki Hano as Belvera for all three films.\n\n''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' does not feature Mothra's fairies, but they are given a nod in the form of a pair of twin girls wearing white clothes during the scene where Mothra flies over Tokyo.

Along with the other monsters, Mothra is briefly enslaved by the Kilaaks, who force her to attack [[Beijing]] and later join Godzilla in the destruction of Tokyo. The Kilaaks' mind control is ultimately broken and Mothra joins the other monsters in the final battle against King Ghidorah.<ref>''[[Destroy all Monsters]]'' (1968).

When the civilization created a device designed to control the Earth's climate, the Earth responded by creating the Black Mothra, Battra - which Mothra defeated, but not before the civilization was wiped out. Mothra's egg is later discovered in 1993 on Infant Island by the Marutomo real estate agency, which seeks to exploit it and Mothra's priestesses for profit. The egg hatches during a fight between Godzilla and a resurrected Battra, and the larva later attacks Tokyo in order to save its priestesses. Mothra forms a cocoon around the [[National Diet Building]], attains its adult form, then briefly fights Battra before joining forces with him in order to fight Godzilla. Battra dies in the attempt and Mothra pledges to fulfill Battra's role in preventing a meteorite from devastating the Earth in 1999.<ref name=\"GvM\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', Mothra becomes aware of [[SpaceGodzilla]]'s advance towards Earth and sends her priestesses to warn Earth of his arrival.<ref name=\"GvSG\">''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994). Directed by Kensho Yamashita. [[Toho]]</ref>\n\n====''Rebirth of Mothra'' trilogy (1996\u20131998)====\n''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' is separate from the Heisei continuity and portrays Mothra as the last remaining member of a species of giant moths who guard the Elias' civilization. This civilization was destroyed millions of years ago by the dragon Desghidorah, whom Mothra defeated. Mothra lays an egg in modern times, but is too weak to fight Desghidorah once it returns. The egg hatches and the new Mothra, a male larva named Mothra Leo, goes to protect his mother, but sadly Mothra is mortally wounded by Desghidorah while Leo is still too weak to injure the dragon. After Mothra dies, Leo metamorphoses into an [[imago|adult]], then manages to kill Desghidorah.<ref name=\"RoM\">''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' (1996). Directed by Okihiro Yoneda. [[Toho]]</ref>\n\nLeo returns in ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'', where he acquires a new and more powerful form in order to fight the pollution monster Dagahra.<ref name=\"RoMII\">''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'' (1997). Directed by Kunio Miyoshi. [[Toho]]</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter of the trilogy, ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'', Leo is forced to return to the [[Cretaceous Period]] in order to retroactively kill the space dragon [[King Ghidorah]].<ref name=\"RoMIII\">''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998). Directed by Okihiro Yoneda. [[Toho]]</ref>\n\n===Millennium (2001\u20132004)===\nIn ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', Mothra is portrayed as having been one of the three guardians of Yamato, originating 1,000 years before the events of the film. Initially an antagonist, Mothra was imprisoned in [[Lake Ikeda]], only to be reawakened in 2001 to halt Godzilla's destruction of Tokyo. She is defeated, but transfers her spirit to [[King Ghidorah]].<ref name=\"GMK\"/>\n\n''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' has the Mothra from the original 1961 film send her priestesses to demand that Japan dismantle the anti-Godzilla weapon [[Mechagodzilla|Kiryu]] or face destruction, as she considers the cyborg to be against the natural order, having been created using the bones of the first Godzilla. When the second Godzilla lands, Mothra attempts to fight the monster alongside Kiryu, but is killed in the process. Two larvae hatch on Infant Island and reach Tokyo in order to fight Godzilla, whom they encase in a cocoon, which is then transported into the ocean by Kiryu.<ref name=\"GTSOS\">''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003). Directed by Masaaki Tezuka. [[Toho]].</ref>\n\n''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', which ignores the continuity of the previous film, establishes that Mothra protected the Earth 10,000 years ago from the cyborg [[Gigan]]. In the distant future, Gigan returns, under the control of the Xiliens, and is confronted by Mothra. In the ensuing battle, Mothra catches fire, but manages to kill Gigan by ramming into it and exploding.<ref name=\"GFW\">''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004). Directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. [[Toho]].</ref> However, in a mid-credits scene, Mothra is shown to be alive after all and flying back to Infant Island to be reunited with the Shobijin.\n\n===Anime trilogy (2018)===\nWhile Mothra never made a physical appearance, she was mentioned in ''[[Godzilla: City on the Edge of Battle]]'' to have been killed by Godzilla years prior, though her egg ended up in the protection of the Houtua people, a species of evolved humans who adapted Mothra-like features to survive the now Godzilla ruled Earth. An astral projection of Mothra's unborn child in their adult form appears in ''[[Godzilla: The Planet Eater]]''.\n\n===MonsterVerse (2019\u2013)===\n{{Update|section|date=June 2019}}\nIn 2014, [[Legendary Pictures]] announced that they had acquired the rights to [[Rodan]], Mothra and [[King Ghidorah]] from [[Toho]] to use in their [[MonsterVerse]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=Adrianne |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/26/5940259/godzilla-2-confirmed-with-director-gareth-edwards |title=Gareth Edwards returns to direct 'Godzilla 2' with Rodan and Mothra |publisher=The Verge |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[post-credits scene]] at the end of the 2017 film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', Mothra appears in a series of cave paintings depicting other monsters that are known to exist that are shown in the footage to James Conrad and Mason Weaver, along with Godzilla, Rodan and King Ghidorah.<ref name=\"KSI\">''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017).

Monarch Sciences, the film's promotional website, identifies the [[Yunnan|Yunnan rainforest]] as Mothra's location (however, Infant Island was referenced within the film, and the name \"Mosura\" is said to be derived from a small Indonesian island) and states in its adult form to be capable of emitting beta-wave [[bioluminescence]] that can be projected through the intricate patterns on its wings and weaponized into destructive and blinding \u2018god rays\u2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=Hannah |url=https://screenrant.com/godzilla-2-monarch-site-every-secret/ |title=Godzilla 2's Monarch Website: Every Image & Reveal |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2018-07-18 |accessdate=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monarchsciences.com |title=Monarch Sciences |publisher=Monarch Sciences |date= |accessdate=2020-03-01}}</ref> Further promotional material also revealed narrower wings, a wider wingspan (at 803 feet or 244.75 meters, it is second only to her original 250-meter wingspan), long [[Mantis|praying mantis]]-like forearms and legs as opposed to bird-like limbs and a body design that is more reminiscent of real-life moths, with a smaller body and head. The markings on her wings are said to mark her as the \"Queen of the Monsters\" and that they apparently link Mothra to Godzilla, the King of the Monsters, since the eye spots on her wings are modeled after Godzilla's eyes. Within the film, she is shown to have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with Godzilla, and temporarily paralyzes Rodan with a hidden abdominal stinger. These changes make Mothra the most heavily redesigned monster in the series.\n\nMothra first appears hatching from her egg in her larval state and is calmed by Dr. Emma Russell using the ORCA [[Bioacoustics|bio-acoustics]] device, becoming docile. When eco-terrorists led by Colonel Alan Jonah arrive soon after and capture Russell, her daughter Madison and the ORCA device, Mothra retreats under a waterfall and cocoons herself, later emerging from her cocoon in her adult form and flying off. During the fight in [[Boston]], Mothra defeats Rodan and is disintegrated by King Ghidorah while protecting a fallen Godzilla. Her power is transferred to Godzilla as a result via her ashes, preventing him from suffering a nuclear meltdown and allowing him to defeat Ghidorah by achieving his burning form. During the credits, a news program speculates about the existence of a second Mothra egg, which the director later confirmed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike DoughertyVerified account |url=https://twitter.com/Mike_Dougherty/status/1136555493412024321 |title=Mike Dougherty on Twitter: \"To lay her egg. \u0111&#x;\u015a\u2039\u0111&#x;\u013d\u0161 #GodzillaMovie\u00e2\u20ac\u015a \" |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2019-06-06 |accessdate=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nA post-credits scene in ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' depicts cave paintings of [[Godzilla]], [[Rodan]], Mothra and King Ghidorah.<ref name=\"KSI Cameo\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/kong-skull-island-after-credits-scene-explained/|title='Kong: Skull Island' Post-Credits Scene Explained|last=Goldberg|first=Matt|work=Collider|date=March 11, 2017|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Films===\n* ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961)\n* ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964)\n* ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'' (1968)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' (1996) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'' (1997) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998) (as Mothra Leo)\n* ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Godzilla: The Planet Eater]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'' (2019)\n\n===Television===\n* ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' (1997-1998)\n* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (1989\u2013present)\n* ''[[Sonic X]]'' (2003-2005)\n\n===Video games===\n* ''[[Godzilla: Monster of Monsters]]'' ([[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] -
