Such singles include \"Show Me\", \"Free\", \"Desire\", \"Get it Up (the Feeling)\", \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", and her number-one hits \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\", \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give it All You Got]]\" featuring Chris Willis, \"Waiting On You\" and \"Everybody Loves the Night\". In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'' ranked her as the 12th most successful dance artist of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn '''Ultra Nat\u00e9''' in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], United States, she displayed her singing talent at an early age. Growing up, Nat\u00e9 enjoyed a wide variety of music; she enjoyed listening to artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Boy George]], whom Nat\u00e9 would later say helped her become more open to being more experimental with her style and production of music.<ref>{{cite news| author=DJ Ron Slomowicz| url=http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| title=Interview with Ultra Nate| publisher=Dance Music / Electronica| year=2007| accessdate=2007-09-21| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803141550/http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| archivedate=2004-08-03}}</ref>\n\nShe is best known in her home country for her 1990s dance crossover track, \"Free\". She is also remembered in America for her team-up with [[Amber (singer)|Amber]] and [[Jocelyn Enriquez]] as [[Stars on 54]] on a 1998 cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"If You Could Read My Mind\", which was a minor mainstream American hit. It reached #52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and #3 on the [[Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. Though she has had club success in America, she has found the majority of her singles and, especially, album sales success in [[Europe]].\n\n===Career===\nUltra Nat\u00e9 began her recording career on a major label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], signed through its British offices.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=407}}</ref> Through it, she released her first two albums. Her debut album, ''[[Blue Notes in the Basement]]'' (1991) was created along with the [[Basement Boys]] and it featured the singles \"It's Over Now\", \"Deeper Love (Missing You)\", \"Is It Love\", and the gospel-tinged \"Rejoicing\".<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the [[alternative dance]]/[[house music|house]] ''[[One Woman's Insanity]]'' was released.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Although it still featured the Basement Boys' production on several tracks, this time Ultra found herself working with [[Nellee Hooper]], and [[Kwame Kwaten#Biography|D-Influence]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> At a time when soulful [[house music]] performers such as [[Robin S]] and [[Crystal Waters]] were scoring cross-over Top Ten Pop singles, it was believed that Ultra Nat\u00e9 would score a similar level of commercial success. Mainstream sales however were not achieved even though \"Show Me\" received moderate mainstream pop radio airplay. Singles included \"How Long\", \"Show Me\" (her first song to reach the top position on the US Dance charts) and \"Joy\". However, neither release sold very well, and she was dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1995, Ultra Nat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)\" to the soundtrack to the independent film starring [[Parker Posey]]. The single was commercially released by the [[King Street Sounds]] label.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. tried to push her in another direction, Ultra Nat\u00e9 left the major label and moved to the independent dance label, [[Strictly Rhythm]]. It was here that \"Free\", her biggest mainstream hit, was released in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The song, co-written by Nat\u00e9, Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone while production was held by both Springsteen and Ciafone, enjoyed heavy airplay throughout the summer, not only in clubs, but on rhythmic and mainstream radio stations in America and Europe. \"Free\" peaked at number 75 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It became a substantial hit in the UK, where it peaked at number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]], helping its parent album 'Situation: Critical' reach number seventeen on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> It was also successful in Canada where it reached number 10 at the Canadian Singles Charts.<ref>{{cite news | author=| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r351038/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | title= AllMusicGuide entry | website=[[AllMusic]]| date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this album that Ultra Nat\u00e9's greatest commercial success was achieved, particularly in Europe, where singles such as \"Found a Cure\" (No. 6 in the UK), and \"New Kind of Medicine\" (No 14 UK) also charted.\n\nIn 1998, a new single \"Pressure\" was released internationally. Taken from the soundtrack to the film ''The 24 Hour Woman'', it contained three club mixes. The original version of the track was found on 'Situation: Critical\" but listed as \"Release the Pressure\".\n\nHer follow-up album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Ultra Nate album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', which was released in 2001, featured the production work of artists such as [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]], [[4 Hero]], and Mood II Swing. Four singles were released: \"Desire\", \"Get It Up (The Feeling)\", \"Twisted\", and \"I Don't Understand It\".\n\nNat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Wonderful Place\" to the AIDS benefit compilation ''Keep Hope Alive: A Lifebeat Benefit Compilation''. Additionally, in 2004, she released the singles \"Feel Love\", \"Brass in Pocket\", \"Time of Our Lives\" (released as \"Ultra Devoted featuring Ultra Nat\u00e9 and Gerry DeVeaux\"), and a new version of \"Free\" that features twelve new mixes. In 2005, she collaborated with [[Alex Gaudino|Gaudino]] and released the single \"Bitter Sweet Melody\". Later in the same year she found herself again on the charts, when her featured vocals on the [[StoneBridge (DJ)|Stonebridge]] single \"[[Freak On]]\" became a successful dance hit. She also performed on the British show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby One More Time]]''.\n\nHaving become a mother for the first time in the fall of 2005, Nat\u00e9 released her fifth album ''[[Grime, Silk, & Thunder]]'' on her newly created imprint Blufire in partnership with [[Tommy Boy Records]]. The first single released was \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", which became available through the US [[iTunes Store]] August 8, 2006 and reached number two on the American [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and made the Top 30 on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart. The second single \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\" (a cover version of the [[Pointer Sisters]] hit) reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart (the week ending April 28, 2007). It also received airplay in the Rhythmic/Dance format radio where it reached the Top 30 of most playlists in this radio format. Following Automatic, Ultra released \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give It All You Got]]\" which features Chris Willis in Dec 2007. The song hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Music/Club Play charts the week ending February 23, 2008.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced that US singer [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], previously of [[Destiny's Child]] has collaborated on a song with Ultra called \"I'm Waiting On You\", for use on both of their next studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a162286/michelle-williams-162286/|title=Michelle Williams|first=Nick|last=Levine|date=29 June 2009|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> In 2010 Ultra has released a Bob Sinclar remix of her hit \"Free\" on Strictly Rhythm. \"Give It 2 U\" in collaboration with Quentin Harris for his album \"Sacrifice\". She also released \"Destination\" in collaboration with Tony Moran which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Dance Play chart. \"Destination\" was the second single off Tony's album, Mix Magic Music.\n\nIn 2010 she released an EP titled \"Things Happen At Night\" featuring Ultra's pop and soul melodies and vocals over percussive club beats done by Unruly productions. January 2011 is saw the release of Ultra's next single with Strictly Rhythm on her Deep Sugar label imprint called \"[[Turn It Up (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Turn It Up]]\" with a music video directed by Leo Herrera. \"Turn It Up\" was the first single to be released from her sixth studio album titled ''Hero Worship''.\n\nIn September 2011, she submitted the song, \"My Love\" to represent [[Switzerland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Switzerland]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], to be held in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. However, though close, the song failed to reach the final.<ref>[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/17658 Eurovision Song Contest - Baku 2012 | News - Switzerland: American singer Ultra Nat\u00e9 on the race to Baku].

Such singles include \"Show Me\", \"Free\", \"Desire\", \"Get it Up (the Feeling)\", \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", and her number-one hits \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\", \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give it All You Got]]\" featuring Chris Willis, \"Waiting On You\" and \"Everybody Loves the Night\". In December 2016, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'' ranked her as the 12th most successful dance artist of all-time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn '''Ultra Nat\u00e9''' in [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], United States, she displayed her singing talent at an early age. Growing up, Nat\u00e9 enjoyed a wide variety of music; she enjoyed listening to artists such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Boy George]], whom Nat\u00e9 would later say helped her become more open to being more experimental with her style and production of music.<ref>{{cite news| author=DJ Ron Slomowicz| url=http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| title=Interview with Ultra Nate| publisher=Dance Music / Electronica| year=2007| accessdate=2007-09-21| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040803141550/http://dancemusic.about.com/cs/interviews/a/IntUltraNateR.htm| archivedate=2004-08-03}}</ref>\n\nShe is best known in her home country for her 1990s dance crossover track, \"Free\". She is also remembered in America for her team-up with [[Amber (singer)|Amber]] and [[Jocelyn Enriquez]] as [[Stars on 54]] on a 1998 cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"If You Could Read My Mind\", which was a minor mainstream American hit. It reached #52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and #3 on the [[Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart. Though she has had club success in America, she has found the majority of her singles and, especially, album sales success in [[Europe]].\n\n===Career===\nUltra Nat\u00e9 began her recording career on a major label, [[Warner Bros. Records]], signed through its British offices.<ref name=\"Larkin90\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=407}}</ref> Through it, she released her first two albums. Her debut album, ''[[Blue Notes in the Basement]]'' (1991) was created along with the [[Basement Boys]] and it featured the singles \"It's Over Now\", \"Deeper Love (Missing You)\", \"Is It Love\", and the gospel-tinged \"Rejoicing\".<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/>\n\nIn 1993, the [[alternative dance]]/[[house music|house]] ''[[One Woman's Insanity]]'' was released.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> Although it still featured the Basement Boys' production on several tracks, this time Ultra found herself working with [[Nellee Hooper]], and [[Kwame Kwaten#Biography|D-Influence]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> At a time when soulful [[house music]] performers such as [[Robin S]] and [[Crystal Waters]] were scoring cross-over Top Ten Pop singles, it was believed that Ultra Nat\u00e9 would score a similar level of commercial success. Mainstream sales however were not achieved even though \"Show Me\" received moderate mainstream pop radio airplay. Singles included \"How Long\", \"Show Me\" (her first song to reach the top position on the US Dance charts) and \"Joy\". However, neither release sold very well, and she was dropped from the label.\n\nIn 1995, Ultra Nat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Party Girl (Turn Me Loose)\" to the soundtrack to the independent film starring [[Parker Posey]]. The single was commercially released by the [[King Street Sounds]] label.\n\nWhen Warner Bros. tried to push her in another direction, Ultra Nat\u00e9 left the major label and moved to the independent dance label, [[Strictly Rhythm]]. It was here that \"Free\", her biggest mainstream hit, was released in 1997.<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> The song, co-written by Nat\u00e9, Lem Springsteen and John Ciafone while production was held by both Springsteen and Ciafone, enjoyed heavy airplay throughout the summer, not only in clubs, but on rhythmic and mainstream radio stations in America and Europe. \"Free\" peaked at number 75 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. It became a substantial hit in the UK, where it peaked at number four in the [[UK Singles Chart]], helping its parent album 'Situation: Critical' reach number seventeen on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"Larkin90\"/> It was also successful in Canada where it reached number 10 at the Canadian Singles Charts.<ref>{{cite news | author=| url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r351038/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}} | title= AllMusicGuide entry | website=[[AllMusic]]| date=2007-07-27 | accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref>\n\nIt was with this album that Ultra Nat\u00e9's greatest commercial success was achieved, particularly in Europe, where singles such as \"Found a Cure\" (No. 6 in the UK), and \"New Kind of Medicine\" (No 14 UK) also charted.\n\nIn 1998, a new single \"Pressure\" was released internationally. Taken from the soundtrack to the film ''The 24 Hour Woman'', it contained three club mixes. The original version of the track was found on 'Situation: Critical\" but listed as \"Release the Pressure\".\n\nHer follow-up album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Ultra Nate album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', which was released in 2001, featured the production work of artists such as [[Attica Blues (band)|Attica Blues]], [[4 Hero]], and Mood II Swing. Four singles were released: \"Desire\", \"Get It Up (The Feeling)\", \"Twisted\", and \"I Don't Understand It\".\n\nNat\u00e9 contributed the song \"Wonderful Place\" to the AIDS benefit compilation ''Keep Hope Alive: A Lifebeat Benefit Compilation''. Additionally, in 2004, she released the singles \"Feel Love\", \"Brass in Pocket\", \"Time of Our Lives\" (released as \"Ultra Devoted featuring Ultra Nat\u00e9 and Gerry DeVeaux\"), and a new version of \"Free\" that features twelve new mixes. In 2005, she collaborated with [[Alex Gaudino|Gaudino]] and released the single \"Bitter Sweet Melody\". Later in the same year she found herself again on the charts, when her featured vocals on the [[StoneBridge (DJ)|Stonebridge]] single \"[[Freak On]]\" became a successful dance hit. She also performed on the British show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby One More Time]]''.\n\nHaving become a mother for the first time in the fall of 2005, Nat\u00e9 released her fifth album ''[[Grime, Silk, & Thunder]]'' on her newly created imprint Blufire in partnership with [[Tommy Boy Records]]. The first single released was \"[[Love's the Only Drug]]\", which became available through the US [[iTunes Store]] August 8, 2006 and reached number two on the American [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and made the Top 30 on the [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart. The second single \"[[Automatic (Pointer Sisters song)#Ultra Nat\u00e9 cover|Automatic]]\" (a cover version of the [[Pointer Sisters]] hit) reached number one on the US [[Hot Dance Club Play]] chart (the week ending April 28, 2007). It also received airplay in the Rhythmic/Dance format radio where it reached the Top 30 of most playlists in this radio format. Following Automatic, Ultra released \"[[Give It All You Got (Ultra Nat\u00e9 song)|Give It All You Got]]\" which features Chris Willis in Dec 2007. The song hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Music/Club Play charts the week ending February 23, 2008.\n\nIn mid-2009 it was announced that US singer [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], previously of [[Destiny's Child]] has collaborated on a song with Ultra called \"I'm Waiting On You\", for use on both of their next studio albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a162286/michelle-williams-162286/|title=Michelle Williams|first=Nick|last=Levine|date=29 June 2009|website=Digital Spy}}</ref> In 2010 Ultra has released a Bob Sinclar remix of her hit \"Free\" on Strictly Rhythm. \"Give It 2 U\" in collaboration with Quentin Harris for his album \"Sacrifice\".

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocrisy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project. Lily awakes in the [[Napa County, California|Napa]] motel James brought her to, and after realizing they cannot run, decides to go back to San Francisco instead to confront Forest at his house. They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system \u2013 a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is ''[[Deus]]''. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die. Before he walks away, Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Katie admonishes the Devs team for using the projection system for their own amusement, with Stewart scorning her hypocrisy. Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Lily and Jamie argue over whether to contact the police. Kenton waits for Lily outside her apartment, where Pete, the homeless man who lives there, treats him with suspicion and offers Lily his support. Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep. Lily runs to Jamie's apartment, where she calls the police to report Sergei's death as a murder. The police arrive, accompanied by the psychiatrist and Kenton, arrest Lily for causing the crash, and take her away for [[Involuntary commitment|psychiatric commitment]], while Kenton brutally forces Jamie back inside his apartment.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|26}}\n |ShortSummary    = Katie views projections of events from various points in time in the Devs lab, including Kenton torturing Jamie, Lily at age ten playing [[Go (game)|Go]] with her father and talking to him on his deathbed, Sergei and Lily's first meeting and first admission of love for each other, Forest recruiting Katie at a lecture on the superposition of quantum particles after she argues with the professor for disregarding the many-worlds interpretation, the Devs team working on an early projection trial, Forest witnessing the car accident that killed his wife and daughter (superimposed with one reality in which they arrive home safely), Katie talking to Forest about his reasons for starting Devs, Kenton telling Forest and Katie that he will give them up to the authorities rather than go to jail himself, Lily falling to her death inside the Devs lab, and finally, Jamie telling his family to go into hiding before sneaking a heavily sedated Lily out of the psychiatric ward, which Katie watches with a smile.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon breaks into Stewart's [[Motorhome|RV]] and asks him to help him get his Devs job back, as he is unwilling to abandon his work on the project. Lily awakes in the [[Napa County, California|Napa]] motel James brought her to, and after realizing they cannot run, decides to go back to San Francisco instead to confront Forest at his house. They find him there with Katie, who Forest says can answer Lily's questions. Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system \u2013 a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them.

He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is ''[[Deus]]''. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die. Before he walks away, Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

Involving forces from Australia, New Zealand and Japan, the battle was part of the wider [[Bougainville campaign]], which had begun in late 1943 and lasted until the end of the war in August 1945. The battle formed part of Australian efforts to liberate the northern part of Bougainville.\n\nThe fighting occurred after a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized Australian force from the [[31st Battalion (Australia)|31st/51st Infantry Battalion]] made an amphibious landing north of the Porton Plantation{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this was \"Moton\".<ref name=Tanaka296>{{harvnb|Tanaka|1980|p=296}}.</ref>|group=Note}} [[Jetty|jetties]] in an attempt to outflank the Japanese positions on the [[Battle of Ratsua|Ratsua]] front, which were holding up the advance of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th]] and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalions from the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th Brigade]]. The Australians landed unopposed and established a small perimeter, but some of their landing craft ran aground and they were unable to bring their heavy weapons and support elements ashore. Troops from the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force quickly surrounded the beachhead and, as their supply situation grew desperate, the Australians were forced to withdraw. In the course of their evacuation by sea another landing craft ran aground. Over the next two days several unsuccessful rescue attempts were made until eventually, in the early morning of 11 June, the last Australian survivors were picked up.\n\nThe battle was a victory for the Japanese and it proved instrumental in helping them to regain the initiative in the northern sector of Bougainville. As a result, shortly afterwards the Australian forces on Bougainville changed the focus of their operations to the southern sector of the island where they were able to advance along the coastal plain towards the main Japanese position at [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]]. Since the end of the war, there has been considerable criticism of the planning undertaken by the Australians prior to the operation, and it has been argued that the operation failed due to poor intelligence and lack of resources and was ultimately unnecessary.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic situation===\nJapanese forces had [[Invasion of Buka and Bougainville|landed on Bougainville]] in early 1942, capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern [[Solomon Islands]] and to attack the Allied [[lines of communication]] between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area.<ref>{{harvnb|Keogh|1965|p=414}}.</ref> These bases also helped protect [[Rabaul]], the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.<ref>{{harvnb|Rentz|1946| p=1}}.</ref> US Marines conducted an [[Landings at Cape Torokina|amphibious landing at Cape Torokina]], on the western coast of the island, north of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack which had been repulsed, the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a [[Bougainville counterattack|heavy counter-attack]], which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2012|pp=29\u201330}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shindo|2016|pp=61\u201363}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Map nw bougainville 1945.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|North-west Bougainville.|alt=A detailed map showing the north-western coast line of an island. Several harbours are depicted, along with various locations]]\n\nOn 22 November 1944, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]], consisting mainly of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] troops under the command of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] [[Stanley Savige]], took over responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]]. Throughout November and December Australian units began relieving the Americans who were then redeployed on [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|subsequent operations in the Philippines]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keogh|1965|p= 416}}.</ref> Although Japanese forces on Bougainville actually numbered around 40,000 men at the time,<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=191}}.</ref> Allied intelligence failed to determine this accurately, estimating that there were only about 17,500 defenders. As a result of this error, Australian planning staff believed that they were opposed by a roughly equal-sized force and the Australian corps commander, Savige, under orders from [[General (Australia)|General]] [[Thomas Blamey]], commander-in-chief of the Australian Military Forces during the war, to \"destroy... [Japanese]...resistance...without committing major forces\" and limiting casualties, consequently decided that he would pursue a limited offensive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville.<ref name=Johnston30>{{harvnb|Johnston|2007|p= 30}}.</ref><ref name=James2016_234>{{harvnb|James|2016|p=234}}.</ref> The majority of the Japanese force was believed to be concentrated in the south and as a result the main effort of the Australian plan was focused upon driving towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]]. Supporting operations were also conducted along two other fronts. In the north, it was planned that the Japanese would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained there while, in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further [[counter-attack]]s and opening the way for a drive to the east coast.<ref>{{harvnb|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}.</ref> The Australian troops were largely inexperienced, but were according to historian Karl James \"fresh...[and] well equipped\". For their part, according to James, the Japanese force on Bougainville had been \"...reinforced from Rabaul with troops, weapons and equipment\" and although much of 1944 had been spent foraging and establishing food supplies on the island, there was only \"enough food reserves for four months\".<ref name=James2016_234/>\n\nThe build up of Australian forces was hampered by a lack of resources, which were focused largely upon the US operations in the Philippines,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2016|p=38}}.</ref> and Australian operations in Borneo, which was considered the priority, and ultimately these considerations would impact upon Australian strategy upon the island due to the limited amount of amphibious support available.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2016|p=226}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dennis et al|1995|p=429}}.</ref> After initial moves by the Australians to take over the US perimeter at Torokina and garrison the Outer Islands in September and October, in November the Australians took over officially from the Americans. Later that month, troops from the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]] left the perimeter and took over from the small US forces holding outposts along the Numa Numa Trail in the centre of the island. From there, a couple of minor skirmishes followed culminating in the Battle of Pearl Ridge.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2016|pp=235\u2013236}}.</ref> In late December, the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th Brigade]], under the command of [[Brigadier (Australia)|Brigadier]] [[John Rowlstone Stevenson|John Stevenson]], took over control of the northern sector of the island from the 7th Brigade, which was transferred to the southern sector to take part in the main offensive. Throughout January, as part of efforts to liberate the northern part of the island, the brigade advanced north along the coast from Kuraio Mission, clearing the main settlements while sending patrols inland in an effort to flush out the Japanese from the high features in an effort to draw them into fighting in the open.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=122}}.</ref> In mid-January the lead Australian battalion, the [[31st/51st Battalion (Australia)|31st/51st Infantry Battalion]], under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel (Australia)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Joseph Kelly, came up against a strong Japanese position at [[Battle of Tsimba Ridge|Tsimba Ridge]]{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this feature was \"Sun Highland\".<ref name=Tanaka296/>|group=Note}} and over the course of three weeks fought to gain control of the feature. The Australians lost 23 killed and 53 wounded while the Japanese had at least 66 men killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=125}}.</ref>\n\n===Preliminary moves===\n\nFollowing the fighting on Tsimba Ridge, the 31st/51st was relieved by the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th Infantry Battalion]], and the Australians continued to advance north towards Soraken. Over the course of several months, the 26th advanced on several axes: from Downs' Ridge they crossed the Nagam River, while on the coast another element advanced through Lalum to the Compton River. Between these two forces, another linked up with those that had crossed the Nagam, and proceeded north over the Compton towards Soraken Plantation. Elsewhere, barges were used to land forces on the Soraken Peninsula in several locations to dislocate the Japanese forces there and sever their lines of communication, while other landings took place on Saposa Island and Torokori Island.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2012|p=120}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|James|2016|p=240}}.</ref> In April, the 26th was relieved by the [[55th/53rd Battalion (Australia)|55th/53rd Infantry Battalion]] which advanced north to Ratsua,{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this was \"Tasui\".<ref name=Tanaka296/>|group=Note}} from where the Australians planned to move along the Bonis Peninsula. By late May, however, casualties amongst the 55th/53rd meant that they had to be withdrawn from the line, and the 26th Infantry Battalion was moved back up to replace them, along with the 31st/51st.<ref name=Maitland120121>{{harvnb|Maitland|1999|pp=120\u2013121}}.</ref> At the start of June the Australians were stretched out across a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} line between Ratsua to Ruri Bay.<ref name=Lawie44>{{harvnb|Lawie|2001|p= 44}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bougainville 1945.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Military officers discuss a tactical situation around a map |Australian commanders on Bougainville, May 1945]]\n\nOn 4 June, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion began patrolling operations around Buoi Plantation.

The bulk of the force was made up of [[infantry]] from 'A' Company and a [[platoon]] from 'C' Company, 31st/51st Infantry Battalion under the command of [[Captain (Australia)|Captain]] Clyde Downs.

Although one of these craft was later able to float free, two of the others remained stuck.

The Australian high command decided to refocus their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result the effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further resources were transferred out of the sector.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=234\u2013235}}.</ref> Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion [[Battle of Ratsua|continued fighting along the Ratsua front]] before being relieved on 28 June by the [[8th Battalion (Australia)|8th Infantry Battalion]] and withdrawing to [[Torokina]], where they remained until the end of the war.<ref name=Davidson140/> The [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and [[27th Battalion (Australia)|27th Infantry Battalions]] carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July,<ref name=Long253>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=235}}.</ref> by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2005|p=196}}.</ref> Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came to a conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=237}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Battle of Porton wounded 12 June 1945.jpg|left|thumb|Australian wounded are evacuated during the Battle of Porton Plantation, 12 June 1945.|alt=Wounded men lie on stretchers on the deck of a landing craft covered by blankets. Others are tending the wounded.]]\n\nSince the end of the war, the conceptual validity and strategic necessity of the Australian landing has been called into question by historians. Both James and Davidson state that several aspects of the planning undertaken by 11th Brigade staff and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion's commander contributed to the defeat,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}.</ref><ref name=James144>{{harvnb|James|2012|p=144}}.</ref> particularly in relation to the failure of intelligence to adequately identify the risks posed by the nearby reefs, as well as the failure to adequately resource the operation, and an overestimation of the ability of neighbouring forces to breakthrough to the beachhead.<ref name=\"Davidson31_39\"/> Charlton also argues that the landing was hastily planned, under-resourced and inadequately supported, and that it was part of a strategically unnecessary campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Davidson| 2005|pp=140\u2013146}}.</ref><ref name=Charlton57>{{harvnb|Charlton|1983|p=57}}.</ref> James agrees that it was under resourced, stating that the size of the assault force was \"too small to establish a beachhead and push inland as well\", although ultimately argues that the campaign was necessary.<ref name=James144/> It has also been speculated that the Japanese might also have gained prior knowledge of the attack. In support of this, James outlines that in the aftermath of the fighting, Blamey visited Kelly at his headquarters around Ratsua and upon interviewing him, stated to the II Corps commander, Savige, that he felt that Kelly had erred in conducting rehearsals of the barge landings during the planning stage within view of Japanese positions, potentially warning them of the operation.<ref name=James191/>\n\nThe Battle of Porton Plantation ended in defeat for the Australians, as the landing was repulsed and the Japanese remained in possession of the beachhead.<ref name=Davidson140>{{harvnb|Davidson|2005|p=140}}.</ref> Amidst a campaign where largely the Australians dominated \u2013 it was the only defeat \u2013 the battle represented a shift in momentum in the northern sector, which was in part due to the shift in resources south, a fact which continued to impact Australian operations in the sector until the end of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2012|p=147}}.</ref> During the course of the landing and the subsequent withdrawal, the Australians suffered 23 killed or missing, presumed dead, and 106 wounded,<ref

reconnaissance party including officers from the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion returned to the area and found that the Japanese defenders had buried the Australians that had died on the beach and had constructed a memorial to them, reading: \"The Australian soldiers buried here died by the sea\".<ref>{{harvnb|Davidson|2005| p=150}}.</ref> For its part in the landing, the 31st/51st Infantry

Involving forces from Australia, New Zealand and Japan, the battle was part of the wider [[Bougainville campaign]], which had begun in late 1943 and lasted until the end of the war in August 1945. The battle formed part of Australian efforts to liberate the northern part of Bougainville.\n\nThe fighting occurred after a [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized Australian force from the [[31st Battalion (Australia)|31st/51st Infantry Battalion]] made an amphibious landing north of the Porton Plantation{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this was \"Moton\".<ref name=Tanaka296>{{harvnb|Tanaka|1980|p=296}}.</ref>|group=Note}} [[Jetty|jetties]] in an attempt to outflank the Japanese positions on the [[Battle of Ratsua|Ratsua]] front, which were holding up the advance of the [[26th Battalion (Australia)|26th]] and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalions from the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th Brigade]]. The Australians landed unopposed and established a small perimeter, but some of their landing craft ran aground and they were unable to bring their heavy weapons and support elements ashore. Troops from the Japanese 87th Naval Garrison Force quickly surrounded the beachhead and, as their supply situation grew desperate, the Australians were forced to withdraw. In the course of their evacuation by sea another landing craft ran aground. Over the next two days several unsuccessful rescue attempts were made until eventually, in the early morning of 11 June, the last Australian survivors were picked up.\n\nThe battle was a victory for the Japanese and it proved instrumental in helping them to regain the initiative in the northern sector of Bougainville. As a result, shortly afterwards the Australian forces on Bougainville changed the focus of their operations to the southern sector of the island where they were able to advance along the coastal plain towards the main Japanese position at [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]]. Since the end of the war, there has been considerable criticism of the planning undertaken by the Australians prior to the operation, and it has been argued that the operation failed due to poor intelligence and lack of resources and was ultimately unnecessary.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic situation===\nJapanese forces had [[Invasion of Buka and Bougainville|landed on Bougainville]] in early 1942, capturing it from the small force of Australians garrisoning the island. They had subsequently developed several airbases on the island, using it to conduct operations in the northern [[Solomon Islands]] and to attack the Allied [[lines of communication]] between the United States, Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area.<ref>{{harvnb|Keogh|1965|p=414}}.</ref> These bases also helped protect [[Rabaul]], the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea, and throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.<ref>{{harvnb|Rentz|1946| p=1}}.</ref> US Marines conducted an [[Landings at Cape Torokina|amphibious landing at Cape Torokina]], on the western coast of the island, north of [[Empress Augusta Bay]], in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack which had been repulsed, the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a [[Bougainville counterattack|heavy counter-attack]], which was turned back with many casualties. After this, the situation on Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2012|pp=29\u201330}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shindo|2016|pp=61\u201363}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Map nw bougainville 1945.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|North-west Bougainville.|alt=A detailed map showing the north-western coast line of an island. Several harbours are depicted, along with various locations]]\n\nOn 22 November 1944, the [[II Corps (Australia)|Australian II Corps]], consisting mainly of [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] troops under the command of [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] [[Stanley Savige]], took over responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville from the US [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV Corps]]. Throughout November and December Australian units began relieving the Americans who were then redeployed on [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|subsequent operations in the Philippines]].<ref>{{harvnb|Keogh|1965|p= 416}}.</ref> Although Japanese forces on Bougainville actually numbered around 40,000 men at the time,<ref>{{harvnb|Grey|2008|p=191}}.</ref> Allied intelligence failed to determine this accurately, estimating that there were only about 17,500 defenders. As a result of this error, Australian planning staff believed that they were opposed by a roughly equal-sized force and the Australian corps commander, Savige, under orders from [[General (Australia)|General]] [[Thomas Blamey]], commander-in-chief of the Australian Military Forces during the war, to \"destroy... [Japanese]...resistance...without committing major forces\" and limiting casualties, consequently decided that he would pursue a limited offensive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville.<ref name=Johnston30>{{harvnb|Johnston|2007|p= 30}}.</ref><ref name=James2016_234>{{harvnb|James|2016|p=234}}.</ref> The majority of the Japanese force was believed to be concentrated in the south and as a result the main effort of the Australian plan was focused upon driving towards [[Buin, Papua New Guinea|Buin]]. Supporting operations were also conducted along two other fronts. In the north, it was planned that the Japanese would be forced into the narrow [[Bonis Peninsula]] and contained there while, in the centre, the [[Battle of Pearl Ridge|seizure of Pearl Ridge]] would give the Australians control of the east\u2013west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further [[counter-attack]]s and opening the way for a drive to the east coast.<ref>{{harvnb|Johnston|2007|pp=30\u201331}}.</ref> The Australian troops were largely inexperienced, but were according to historian Karl James \"fresh...[and] well equipped\". For their part, according to James, the Japanese force on Bougainville had been \"...reinforced from Rabaul with troops, weapons and equipment\" and although much of 1944 had been spent foraging and establishing food supplies on the island, there was only \"enough food reserves for four months\".<ref name=James2016_234/>\n\nThe build up of Australian forces was hampered by a lack of resources, which were focused largely upon the US operations in the Philippines,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2016|p=38}}.</ref> and Australian operations in Borneo, which was considered the priority, and ultimately these considerations would impact upon Australian strategy upon the island due to the limited amount of amphibious support available.<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2016|p=226}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Dennis et al|1995|p=429}}.</ref> After initial moves by the Australians to take over the US perimeter at Torokina and garrison the Outer Islands in September and October, in November the Australians took over officially from the Americans. Later that month, troops from the [[7th Brigade (Australia)|7th Brigade]] left the perimeter and took over from the small US forces holding outposts along the Numa Numa Trail in the centre of the island. From there, a couple of minor skirmishes followed culminating in the Battle of Pearl Ridge.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2016|pp=235\u2013236}}.</ref> In late December, the [[11th Brigade (Australia)|11th Brigade]], under the command of [[Brigadier (Australia)|Brigadier]] [[John Rowlstone Stevenson|John Stevenson]], took over control of the northern sector of the island from the 7th Brigade, which was transferred to the southern sector to take part in the main offensive. Throughout January, as part of efforts to liberate the northern part of the island, the brigade advanced north along the coast from Kuraio Mission, clearing the main settlements while sending patrols inland in an effort to flush out the Japanese from the high features in an effort to draw them into fighting in the open.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=122}}.</ref> In mid-January the lead Australian battalion, the [[31st/51st Battalion (Australia)|31st/51st Infantry Battalion]], under the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel (Australia)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Joseph Kelly, came up against a strong Japanese position at [[Battle of Tsimba Ridge|Tsimba Ridge]]{{#tag:ref|The Japanese name for this feature was \"Sun Highland\".<ref name=Tanaka296/>|group=Note}} and over the course of three weeks fought to gain control of the feature.

Over the course of several months, the 26th advanced on several axes: from Downs' Ridge they crossed the Nagam River, while on the coast another element advanced through Lalum to the Compton River. Between these two forces, another linked up with those that had crossed the Nagam, and proceeded north over the Compton towards Soraken Plantation.

Although one of these craft was later able to float free, two of the others remained stuck. A short time later they began to take fire from Japanese machine-guns, which stopped the Australians from unloading their equipment.<ref name=Maitland121>{{harvnb|Maitland|1999|p=121}}.</ref><ref name=Long211>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=211}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Porton jetty (AWM image P02729 008).jpg|thumb|left|An aerial photograph showing the landing beach and jetty at Porton Plantation in May 1945.|alt=An aerial photograph showing a cleared area of beach, with the words \"Porton jetty\" labelled in pencil with an arrow.]]\n\nLacking organic indirect fire support as all the mortars had been in the landing craft that were in the second wave,<ref name=Long211/> Downs established communications with the artillery, and a barrage was brought down on suspected Japanese positions by the artillery [[forward observation officer]], [[Lieutenant (Australia)|Lieutenant]] David Spark,<ref name=Burke6/> with the assistance of a [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) [[CAC Boomerang|Boomerang]] that was on station overhead to provide aerial observation.<ref name=James179/> By dawn, Downs' company was taking sporadic fire from Japanese pill boxes, and they began patrolling forward of their perimeter to locate these positions.

In order to respond, an attempt was made by the Australians to bring in reinforcements of their own and supplies by sea.

Up until that point casualties had been relatively light with only four killed and seven wounded, but the Japanese force, which had increased overnight to between 400 and 500 men as reinforcements arrived by barges and trucks from the Buka Passage area,<ref name=Lawie45>{{harvnb|Lawie|2001|p=45}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|James|2005|pp=181\u2013183}}.</ref> launched a strong attack aimed at destroying the Australian force, attacking from three sides of the perimeter. In order to defend themselves the Australians called down heavy artillery fire from the [[Artillery battery|battery]] of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25-pounders]] that was supporting them from its position on the Soraken peninsula.<ref name=Lawie45/><ref>{{harvnb|Davidson|2005|p=62}}.</ref> As the fighting intensified, some of the artillery shells were brought down as close as {{convert|25|yd|m}} from their own troops.

Shortly after this a Japanese [[anti-tank gun]] fired two shells at the landing craft, destroying its stern. Further shots were prevented when Australian artillery ranged in on the gun, having been directed by Captain [[John Whitelaw (1921\u20132010)|John Whitelaw]],<ref name=Burke7/> an artillery observer on one of two landing craft that had been despatched with [[canvas]] assault boats, crewed by engineers from the 16th Field Company.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=214}}.</ref>\n\nLaunching {{convert|150|yd|m}} from the stranded craft, three assault boats set out and over the course of two hours ferried the survivors back to the landing craft, which then set out for Soraken, arriving there at 4:30&nbsp;am on 11 June.<ref name=Long215/> Other men swam over {{convert|5|km|mi}} through the shark-infested waters to Torokori Island,<ref name=Burke7/><ref name=Lawie47/> while others were either rescued at sea or managed to link up with the Australians along the Ratsua front, who had been attempting to break through to them but found themselves checked {{convert|500|yd|m}} from them,<ref>{{harvnb|Hughes|1993|pp=253\u2013254}}.</ref> by sneaking through the Japanese lines from the rear.<ref name=Long215/><ref name=James180/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Subsequent operations===\nFollowing the failure of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. The Australian high command decided to refocus their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result the effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further resources were transferred out of the sector.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|pp=234\u2013235}}.</ref> Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion [[Battle of Ratsua|continued fighting along the Ratsua front]] before being relieved on 28 June by the [[8th Battalion (Australia)|8th Infantry Battalion]] and withdrawing to [[Torokina]], where they remained until the end of the war.<ref name=Davidson140/> The [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Arnold Potts]] took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and [[27th Battalion (Australia)|27th Infantry Battalions]] carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July,<ref name=Long253>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=235}}.</ref> by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2005|p=196}}.</ref> Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came to a conclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=237}}.</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\n[[File:Battle of Porton wounded 12 June 1945.jpg|left|thumb|Australian wounded are evacuated during the Battle of Porton Plantation, 12 June 1945.|alt=Wounded men lie on stretchers on the deck of a landing craft covered by blankets. Others are tending the wounded.]]\n\nSince the end of the war, the conceptual validity and strategic necessity of the Australian landing has been called into question by historians. Both James and Davidson state that several aspects of the planning undertaken by 11th Brigade staff and the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion's commander contributed to the defeat,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}.</ref><ref name=James144>{{harvnb|James|2012|p=144}}.</ref> particularly in relation to the failure of intelligence to adequately identify the risks posed by the nearby reefs, as well as the failure to adequately resource the operation, and an overestimation of the ability of neighbouring forces to breakthrough to the beachhead.<ref name=\"Davidson31_39\"/> Charlton also argues that the landing was hastily planned, under-resourced and inadequately supported, and that it was part of a strategically unnecessary campaign.<ref>{{harvnb|Davidson| 2005|pp=140\u2013146}}.</ref><ref name=Charlton57>{{harvnb|Charlton|1983|p=57}}.</ref> James agrees that it was under resourced, stating that the size of the assault force was \"too small to establish a beachhead and push inland as well\", although ultimately argues that the campaign was necessary.<ref name=James144/> It has also been speculated that the Japanese might also have gained prior knowledge of the attack. In support of this, James outlines that in the aftermath of the fighting, Blamey visited Kelly at his headquarters around Ratsua and upon interviewing him, stated to the II Corps commander, Savige, that he felt that Kelly had erred in conducting rehearsals of the barge landings during the planning stage within view of Japanese positions, potentially warning them of the operation.<ref name=James191/>\n\nThe Battle of Porton Plantation ended in defeat for the Australians, as the landing was repulsed and the Japanese remained in possession of the beachhead.<ref name=Davidson140>{{harvnb|Davidson|2005|p=140}}.</ref> Amidst a campaign where largely the Australians dominated \u2013 it was the only defeat \u2013 the battle represented a shift in momentum in the northern sector, which was in part due to the shift in resources south, a fact which continued to impact Australian operations in the sector until the end of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2012|p=147}}.</ref> During the course of the landing and the subsequent withdrawal, the Australians suffered 23 killed or missing, presumed dead, and 106 wounded,<ref name=Long215/> while the Japanese lost 26 killed.<ref name=KatoLong216>{{harvnb|Long|1963|p=216}}.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Charlton provides the figure of 23 Japanese killed.<ref name=Charlton57/>|group=Note}} Both sides seem to have overestimated the casualties that they inflicted, with the Australians believing that they had killed between 147 and 197 Japanese,<ref name=Long215/> and the Japanese estimating Australian losses to have been around 60 killed and 100 wounded.<ref name=KatoLong216/>\n\n===Commemoration===\nAfter the end of hostilities, a reconnaissance party including officers from the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion returned to the area and found that the Japanese defenders had buried the Australians that had died on the beach and had constructed a memorial to them, reading: \"The Australian soldiers buried here died by the sea\".<ref>{{harvnb|Davidson|2005| p=150}}.</ref> For its part in the landing, the 31st/51st Infantry

An optical amplifier may be thought of as a [[laser]] without an [[optical cavity]], or one in which [[feedback]] from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in [[optical communication]] and [[laser physics]].  They are used as [[optical repeater]]s in the long distance [[fiberoptic cable]]s which carry much of the world's telecommunication links.\n\nThere are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, [[stimulated emission]] in the amplifier's [[gain medium]] causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), [[electron]]-[[electron hole|hole]] [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] occurs. In [[Raman amplifier]]s, [[Raman scattering]] of incoming light with [[phonon]]s in the lattice of the gain medium produces [[photon]]s coherent with the incoming photons. [[Parametric amplifier]]s use parametric amplification.\n\n==Laser amplifiers==\nAlmost any laser [[active gain medium]] can be [[laser pumping|pumped]] to produce [[Gain (laser)|gain]] for light at the wavelength of a laser made with the same material as its gain medium. Such amplifiers are commonly used to produce high power laser systems. Special types such as [[regenerative amplifier]]s and [[Chirped-pulse amplification|chirped-pulse amplifiers]] are used to amplify [[ultrashort pulse]]s.\n\n=== Solid-state amplifiers ===\n'''Solid-state amplifiers''' are optical amplifiers that uses a wide range of doped [[Solid-state laser|solid-state]] materials (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, Ti:Sa) and different geometries (disk, slab, rod) to amplify optical signals. The variety of materials allows the amplification of different wavelength while the shape of the medium can distinguish between more suitable for energy of average power scaling.<ref name=\"Catch the Peak\">{{Cite journal|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Catch the Peak|journal=Laser Technik Journal|volume=12|pages=30\u201333| publisher=wiley|doi=10.1002/latj.201500001|year=2015|doi-access=free}}</ref> Beside their use in fundamental research from [[gravitational wave]] detection<ref name=\"Single-frequency laser amplifiers\">{{cite journal|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Fundamental mode, single-frequency laser amplifier for gravitational wave detectors|journal=Optics Express|volume=15|issue=2|pages=459\u201365| publisher=OSA|doi=10.1364/OE.15.000459|pmid=19532263|year=2007|bibcode=2007OExpr..15..459F|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-BAD8-1|hdl-access=free}}</ref> to high energy physics at [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]] they can also be found in many today\u2019s [[Ultrashort pulse laser|ultra short pulsed lasers]].\n\n=== Doped fiber amplifiers ===\n[[Image:Doped fibre amplifier.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic diagram of a simple Doped Fiber Amplifier]]\n'''Doped fiber amplifiers''' (DFAs) are optical amplifiers that use a [[dopant|doped]] [[optical fiber]] as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They are related to [[fiber laser]]s.  The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping [[ions]]. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where the core of a silica fiber is doped with trivalent [[erbium]] ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at or near a wavelength of 980&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] or 1480&nbsp;nm, and exhibits gain in the 1550&nbsp;nm region. The EDFA amplification region varies from application to application and can be anywhere between few nm up to ~80nm. Typical use of EDFA in telecommunications calls for C-band amplifiers ( from ~1528 nm to ~1565 nm) or L-band amplifiers (from ~1565 nm to ~1605 nm).\n\nAn ''erbium-doped waveguide amplifier'' (''EDWA'') is an optical amplifier that uses a [[waveguide]] to boost an optical signal.\n\nAmplification is achieved by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the doped fiber.  The pump laser excites ions into a higher energy from where they can decay via stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level.  The excited ions can also decay spontaneously (spontaneous emission) or even through nonradiative processes involving interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass matrix. These last two decay mechanisms compete with stimulated emission reducing the efficiency of light amplification.\n\nThe ''amplification window'' of an optical amplifier is the range of optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window is determined by the spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.\n\nAlthough the electronic transitions of an isolated ion are very well defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into the glass of the optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened.  This broadening is both [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the [[Stark effect]]. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent erbium ion (Er<sup>+3</sup>) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and in the presence of an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1500&nbsp;nm wavelength. The gain spectrum of the EDFA has several peaks that are smeared by the above broadening mechanisms. The net result is a very broad spectrum (30&nbsp;nm in silica, typically). The broad gain-bandwidth of fiber amplifiers make them particularly useful in \n[[wavelength-division multiplexing|wavelength-division multiplexed]] communications systems as a single amplifier can be utilized to amplify all signals being carried on a fiber and whose wavelengths fall within the gain window.\n\n===Basic principle of EDFA===\nA relatively high-powered beam of light is mixed with the input signal using a wavelength selective coupler (WSC). The input signal and the excitation light must be at significantly different wavelengths.\nThe mixed light is guided into a section of fiber with erbium ions included in the core.\nThis high-powered light beam excites the erbium ions to their higher-energy state.\nWhen the photons belonging to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited erbium ions, the erbium ions give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state.\nA significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual \u2013 when an atom \u201clases\u201d it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser.  The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.\n\n===Noise===\nThe principal source of noise in DFAs is [[Amplified Spontaneous Emission]] (ASE), which has a spectrum approximately the same as the gain spectrum of the amplifier. [[Noise figure]] in an ideal DFA is 3&nbsp;dB, while practical amplifiers can have noise figure as large as 6\u20138&nbsp;dB.\n\nAs well as decaying via stimulated emission, electrons in the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level.  Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted in a direction that falls within the [[numerical aperture]] of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber.  Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission.  The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified in the same manner as the signals, hence the term ''Amplified Spontaneous Emission''.  ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance.  Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.\n\n===Gain saturation===\nGain is achieved in a DFA due to [[population inversion]] of the dopant ions.  The inversion level of a DFA is set, primarily, by the power of the pump wavelength and the power at the amplified wavelengths.  As the signal power increases, or the pump power decreases, the inversion level will reduce and thereby the gain of the amplifier will be reduced.  This effect is known as gain saturation \u2013 as the signal level increases, the amplifier saturates and cannot produce any more output power, and therefore the gain reduces.  Saturation is also commonly known as gain compression.\n\nTo achieve optimum noise performance DFAs are operated under a significant amount of gain compression (10&nbsp;dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller input signal powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.\n\nThe leading edge of the pulse is amplified, until the saturation energy of the gain medium is reached. In some condition, the width ([[FWHM]]) of the pulse is reduced.<ref name=\"Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers\">{{cite web|last=Paschotta|first=R\u00fcdiger| title=Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers| url=http://www.rp-photonics.com/tutorial_fiber_amplifiers.html| publisher=RP Photonics| accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Inhomogeneous broadening effects===\nDue to the inhomogeneous portion of the linewidth broadening of the dopant ions, the gain spectrum has an inhomogeneous component and gain saturation occurs, to a small extent, in an inhomogeneous manner.  This effect is known as ''[[spectral hole burning]]'' because a high power signal at one wavelength can 'burn' a hole in the gain for wavelengths close to that signal by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened ions.  Spectral holes vary in width depending on the characteristics of the optical fiber in question and the power of the burning signal, but are typically less than 1&nbsp;nm at the short wavelength end of the C-band, and a few nm at the long wavelength end of the C-band. The depth of the holes are very small, though, making it difficult to observe in practice.\n\n===Polarization effects===\nAlthough the DFA is essentially a polarization independent amplifier, a small proportion of the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically < 0.5&nbsp;dB). This is called Polarization Dependent Gain (PDG).\nThe absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites.  The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers \u2013 i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. \nIn an ideal doped fiber without [[birefringence]], the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to [[polarization mode dispersion]]) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG is very difficult to observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).\n\n=== Erbium-doped optical fiber amplifiers ===\n\nThe erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most deployed fiber amplifier as its amplification window coincides with the third transmission window of silica-based optical fiber.\n\nTwo bands have developed in the third transmission window \u2013 the ''Conventional'', or C-band, from approximately 1525&nbsp;nm \u2013 1565&nbsp;nm, and the ''Long'', or L-band, from approximately 1570&nbsp;nm to 1610&nbsp;nm.  Both of these bands can be amplified by EDFAs, but it is normal to use two different amplifiers, each optimized for one of the bands.\n\nThe principal difference between C- and L-band amplifiers is that a longer length of doped fiber is used in L-band amplifiers.  The longer length of fiber allows a lower inversion level to be used, thereby giving at longer wavelengths (due to the band-structure of Erbium in silica) while still providing a useful amount of gain.\n\nEDFAs have two commonly used pumping bands \u2013 980&nbsp;nm and 1480&nbsp;nm.  The 980&nbsp;nm band has a higher absorption cross-section and is generally used where low-noise performance is required.  The absorption band is relatively narrow and so wavelength stabilised laser sources are typically needed.  The 1480&nbsp;nm band has a lower, but broader, absorption cross-section and is generally used for higher power amplifiers.  A combination of 980&nbsp;nm and 1480&nbsp;nm pumping is generally utilised in amplifiers.\n\nGain and lasing in Erbium-doped fibers were first demonstrated in 1986\u201387 by two groups; one including [[David N.

However, those regions have not seen any significant commercial use so far and so those amplifiers have not been the subject of as much development as the EDFA. However, [[Ytterbium]] doped fiber lasers and amplifiers, operating near 1 micrometre wavelength, have many applications in industrial processing of materials, as these devices can be made with extremely high output power (tens of kilowatts).\n\n==Semiconductor optical amplifier==<!--Semiconductor optical amplifier redirects here-->\nSemiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are amplifiers which use a semiconductor to provide the gain medium.<ref>M. J. Connolly, Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers. Boston, MA: Springer-Verlag, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-7657-6}}</ref> These amplifiers have a similar structure to [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot]] [[laser diodes]] but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted [[wave guide]] and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which is greater than the gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-P\u00e9rot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry in order to reduce the power density on the output facet.\n\nSemiconductor optical amplifiers are typically made from group III-V compound semiconductors such as [[GaAs]]/AlGaAs, [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/[[InGaAs]], [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InGaAsP and [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InAlGaAs, though any direct band gap semiconductors such as II-VI could conceivably be used. Such amplifiers are often used in telecommunication systems in the form of fiber-pigtailed components, operating at signal wavelengths between 850&nbsp;nm and 1600&nbsp;nm and generating gains of up to 30&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe semiconductor optical amplifier is of small size and electrically pumped. It can be potentially less expensive than the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear]]ity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and [[four wave mixing]]) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh|first1=B.|last2=Mukhopadhyay|first2=S.|title=All-Optical Wavelength encoded NAND and NOR Operations exploiting Semiconductor Optical Amplifier based Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Wavelength Converter and Phase Conjugation System|journal=Optics and Photonics Letters|volume=4|issue=2|pages=1\u20139|year=2011|doi=10.1142/S1793528811000172 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\nThis originates from the short nanosecond or less upper state lifetime, so that the gain reacts rapidly to changes of pump or signal power and the changes of gain also cause phase changes which can distort the signals.\nThis nonlinearity presents the most severe problem for optical communication applications. However it provides the possibility for gain in different wavelength regions from the EDFA. \"Linear optical amplifiers\" using gain-clamping techniques have been developed.\n\nHigh optical nonlinearity makes semiconductor amplifiers attractive for all optical signal processing like all-optical switching and wavelength conversion. There has been much research on semiconductor optical amplifiers as elements for optical signal processing, wavelength conversion, clock recovery, signal demultiplexing, and pattern recognition.\n\n===Vertical-cavity SOA===\nA recent addition to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers ([[VCSEL]]s). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically on the order of a few percent) and also a very large [[free spectral range]] (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In addition to boosting the total signal gain, the use of the [[resonant cavity]] structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.\n\nGiven their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are resonant cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In addition to their small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads to a number of advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still in the early stages of research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~memsucsb/Research/MT-VCSOA/MT-VCSOA.html|title=MEMS-Tunable Vertical-cavity SOA|website=Engineering.ucsb.edu|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.\n\n===Tapered amplifiers===\nFor high output power and broader wavelength range, tapered amplifiers are used. These amplifiers consist of a lateral single-mode section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.\n\nTypical parameters:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hanel-photonics.com/tapered_amplifier.html |title=Tapered amplifiers \u2013 available wavelengths and output powers |publisher=Hanel Photonics |accessdate=Sep 26, 2014}}</ref>\n* wavelength range: 633 to 1480&nbsp;nm\n* input power: 10 to 50&nbsp;mW\n* output power: up to 3 W\n\n== Raman amplifier ==\n{{Main|Raman amplification}}\nIn a Raman amplifier, the signal is intensified by [[Raman amplification]]. Unlike the EDFA and SOA the amplification effect is achieved by a nonlinear interaction between the signal and a pump laser within an optical fiber.  There are two types of Raman amplifier: distributed and lumped. A distributed Raman amplifier is one in which the transmission fiber is utilised as the gain medium by multiplexing a pump wavelength with signal wavelength, while a lumped Raman amplifier utilises a dedicated, shorter length of fiber to provide amplification.  In the case of a lumped Raman amplifier, a highly nonlinear fiber with a small core is utilised to increase the interaction between signal and pump wavelengths, and thereby reduce the length of fiber required.\n\nThe pump light may be coupled into the transmission fiber in the same direction as the signal (co-directional pumping), in the opposite direction (contra-directional pumping) or both. Contra-directional pumping is more common as the transfer of noise from the pump to the signal is reduced.\n\nThe pump power required for Raman amplification is higher than that required by the EDFA, with in excess of 500&nbsp;mW being required to achieve useful levels of gain in a distributed amplifier.  Lumped amplifiers, where the pump light can be safely contained to avoid safety implications of high optical powers, may use over 1 W of optical power.\n\nThe principal advantage of Raman amplification is its ability to provide distributed amplification within the transmission fiber, thereby increasing the length of spans between amplifier and [[Signal regeneration|regeneration]] sites.  The amplification bandwidth of Raman amplifiers is defined by the pump wavelengths utilised and so amplification can be provided over wider, and different, regions than may be possible with other amplifier types which rely on dopants and device design to define the amplification 'window'.\n\nRaman amplifiers have some fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, which provides a cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2\u00b5m. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines can be used to increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification is that it is a relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.<ref name=\"Optical Amplifier Tutorial\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiberstore.com/Optical-Amplifier-Tutorial-aid-359.html|title=Optical Amplifier Tutorial - FS.COM|first=FiberStore|last=Team|website=Fiberstore.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, a number of challenges for Raman amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.<ref name=\"Optical Amplifier Tutorial\"/>\n\n''Note: The text of an earlier version of this article was taken from the public domain [[Federal Standard 1037C]].''\n\n== Optical parametric amplifier ==\nAn [[optical parametric amplifier]] allows the amplification of a weak signal-impulse in a [[Centrosymmetry|noncentrosymmetric]] nonlinear medium (e.g. [[Beta barium borate]] (BBO)). In contrast to the previously mentioned amplifiers, which are mostly used in telecommunication environments, this type finds its main application in expanding the frequency tunability of ultrafast [[solid-state laser]]s (e.g. [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]). By using a [[Collinear|noncollinear]] interaction geometry optical parametric amplifiers are capable of extremely broad amplification bandwidths.\n\n== Recent achievements ==\nThe adoption of high power [[fiber laser]]s as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing for several years and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5&nbsp;kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications have steadily progressed in the last few years from a few watts of output power, initially to the tens of watts and now into the hundreds of watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the adoption of stimulated [[brillouin scattering]] (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design including large mode area (LMA) fibers with a low-aperture core,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koplow|first=Jeffrey P.|last2=Kliner|first2=Dahv A.

An optical amplifier may be thought of as a [[laser]] without an [[optical cavity]], or one in which [[feedback]] from the cavity is suppressed. Optical amplifiers are important in [[optical communication]] and [[laser physics]].  They are used as [[optical repeater]]s in the long distance [[fiberoptic cable]]s which carry much of the world's telecommunication links.\n\nThere are several different physical mechanisms that can be used to amplify a light signal, which correspond to the major types of optical amplifiers. In doped fiber amplifiers and bulk lasers, [[stimulated emission]] in the amplifier's [[gain medium]] causes amplification of incoming light. In semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), [[electron]]-[[electron hole|hole]] [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]] occurs. In [[Raman amplifier]]s, [[Raman scattering]] of incoming light with [[phonon]]s in the lattice of the gain medium produces [[photon]]s coherent with the incoming photons. [[Parametric amplifier]]s use parametric amplification.\n\n==Laser amplifiers==\nAlmost any laser [[active gain medium]] can be [[laser pumping|pumped]] to produce [[Gain (laser)|gain]] for light at the wavelength of a laser made with the same material as its gain medium. Such amplifiers are commonly used to produce high power laser systems. Special types such as [[regenerative amplifier]]s and [[Chirped-pulse amplification|chirped-pulse amplifiers]] are used to amplify [[ultrashort pulse]]s.\n\n=== Solid-state amplifiers ===\n'''Solid-state amplifiers''' are optical amplifiers that uses a wide range of doped [[Solid-state laser|solid-state]] materials (Nd:YAG, Yb:YAG, Ti:Sa) and different geometries (disk, slab, rod) to amplify optical signals. The variety of materials allows the amplification of different wavelength while the shape of the medium can distinguish between more suitable for energy of average power scaling.<ref name=\"Catch the Peak\">{{Cite journal|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Catch the Peak|journal=Laser Technik Journal|volume=12|pages=30\u201333| publisher=wiley|doi=10.1002/latj.201500001|year=2015|doi-access=free}}</ref> Beside their use in fundamental research from [[gravitational wave]] detection<ref name=\"Single-frequency laser amplifiers\">{{cite journal|last=Frede|first=Maik| title=Fundamental mode, single-frequency laser amplifier for gravitational wave detectors|journal=Optics Express|volume=15|issue=2|pages=459\u201365| publisher=OSA|doi=10.1364/OE.15.000459|pmid=19532263|year=2007|bibcode=2007OExpr..15..459F|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-BAD8-1|hdl-access=free}}</ref> to high energy physics at [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]] they can also be found in many today\u2019s [[Ultrashort pulse laser|ultra short pulsed lasers]].\n\n=== Doped fiber amplifiers ===\n[[Image:Doped fibre amplifier.svg|thumb|right|300px|Schematic diagram of a simple Doped Fiber Amplifier]]\n'''Doped fiber amplifiers''' (DFAs) are optical amplifiers that use a [[dopant|doped]] [[optical fiber]] as a gain medium to amplify an optical signal. They are related to [[fiber laser]]s.  The signal to be amplified and a pump laser are [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] into the doped fiber, and the signal is amplified through interaction with the doping [[ions]]. The most common example is the Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), where the core of a silica fiber is doped with trivalent [[erbium]] ions and can be efficiently pumped with a laser at or near a wavelength of 980&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] or 1480&nbsp;nm, and exhibits gain in the 1550&nbsp;nm region. The EDFA amplification region varies from application to application and can be anywhere between few nm up to ~80nm. Typical use of EDFA in telecommunications calls for C-band amplifiers ( from ~1528 nm to ~1565 nm) or L-band amplifiers (from ~1565 nm to ~1605 nm).\n\nAn ''erbium-doped waveguide amplifier'' (''EDWA'') is an optical amplifier that uses a [[waveguide]] to boost an optical signal.\n\nAmplification is achieved by stimulated emission of photons from dopant ions in the doped fiber.  The pump laser excites ions into a higher energy from where they can decay via stimulated emission of a photon at the signal wavelength back to a lower energy level.  The excited ions can also decay spontaneously (spontaneous emission) or even through nonradiative processes involving interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass matrix. These last two decay mechanisms compete with stimulated emission reducing the efficiency of light amplification.\n\nThe ''amplification window'' of an optical amplifier is the range of optical wavelengths for which the amplifier yields a usable gain. The amplification window is determined by the spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.\n\nAlthough the electronic transitions of an isolated ion are very well defined, broadening of the energy levels occurs when the ions are incorporated into the glass of the optical fiber and thus the amplification window is also broadened.  This broadening is both [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] (all ions exhibit the same broadened spectrum) and inhomogeneous (different ions in different glass locations exhibit different spectra). Homogeneous broadening arises from the interactions with [[phonon]]s of the glass, while inhomogeneous broadening is caused by differences in the glass sites where different ions are hosted. Different sites expose ions to different local electric fields, which shifts the energy levels via the [[Stark effect]]. In addition, the Stark effect also removes the degeneracy of energy states having the same total angular momentum (specified by the quantum number J). Thus, for example, the trivalent erbium ion (Er<sup>+3</sup>) has a ground state with J = 15/2, and in the presence of an electric field splits into J + 1/2 = 8 sublevels with slightly different energies. The first excited state has J = 13/2 and therefore a Stark manifold with 7 sublevels. Transitions from the J = 13/2 excited state to the J= 15/2 ground state are responsible for the gain at 1500&nbsp;nm wavelength. The gain spectrum of the EDFA has several peaks that are smeared by the above broadening mechanisms. The net result is a very broad spectrum (30&nbsp;nm in silica, typically). The broad gain-bandwidth of fiber amplifiers make them particularly useful in \n[[wavelength-division multiplexing|wavelength-division multiplexed]] communications systems as a single amplifier can be utilized to amplify all signals being carried on a fiber and whose wavelengths fall within the gain window.\n\n===Basic principle of EDFA===\nA relatively high-powered beam of light is mixed with the input signal using a wavelength selective coupler (WSC). The input signal and the excitation light must be at significantly different wavelengths.\nThe mixed light is guided into a section of fiber with erbium ions included in the core.\nThis high-powered light beam excites the erbium ions to their higher-energy state.\nWhen the photons belonging to the signal at a different wavelength from the pump light meet the excited erbium ions, the erbium ions give up some of their energy to the signal and return to their lower-energy state.\nA significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual \u2013 when an atom \u201clases\u201d it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. There is usually an isolator placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser.  The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.\n\n===Noise===\nThe principal source of noise in DFAs is [[Amplified Spontaneous Emission]] (ASE), which has a spectrum approximately the same as the gain spectrum of the amplifier. [[Noise figure]] in an ideal DFA is 3&nbsp;dB, while practical amplifiers can have noise figure as large as 6\u20138&nbsp;dB.\n\nAs well as decaying via stimulated emission, electrons in the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level.  Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of those will be emitted in a direction that falls within the [[numerical aperture]] of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber.  Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission.  The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified in the same manner as the signals, hence the term ''Amplified Spontaneous Emission''.  ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance.  Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.\n\n===Gain saturation===\nGain is achieved in a DFA due to [[population inversion]] of the dopant ions.  The inversion level of a DFA is set, primarily, by the power of the pump wavelength and the power at the amplified wavelengths.  As the signal power increases, or the pump power decreases, the inversion level will reduce and thereby the gain of the amplifier will be reduced.  This effect is known as gain saturation \u2013 as the signal level increases, the amplifier saturates and cannot produce any more output power, and therefore the gain reduces.  Saturation is also commonly known as gain compression.\n\nTo achieve optimum noise performance DFAs are operated under a significant amount of gain compression (10&nbsp;dB typically), since that reduces the rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller input signal powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.\n\nThe leading edge of the pulse is amplified, until the saturation energy of the gain medium is reached. In some condition, the width ([[FWHM]]) of the pulse is reduced.<ref name=\"Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers\">{{cite web|last=Paschotta|first=R\u00fcdiger| title=Tutorial on Fiber Amplifiers| url=http://www.rp-photonics.com/tutorial_fiber_amplifiers.html| publisher=RP Photonics| accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Inhomogeneous broadening effects===\nDue to the inhomogeneous portion of the linewidth broadening of the dopant ions, the gain spectrum has an inhomogeneous component and gain saturation occurs, to a small extent, in an inhomogeneous manner.  This effect is known as ''[[spectral hole burning]]'' because a high power signal at one wavelength can 'burn' a hole in the gain for wavelengths close to that signal by saturation of the inhomogeneously broadened ions.  Spectral holes vary in width depending on the characteristics of the optical fiber in question and the power of the burning signal, but are typically less than 1&nbsp;nm at the short wavelength end of the C-band, and a few nm at the long wavelength end of the C-band. The depth of the holes are very small, though, making it difficult to observe in practice.\n\n===Polarization effects===\nAlthough the DFA is essentially a polarization independent amplifier, a small proportion of the dopant ions interact preferentially with certain polarizations and a small dependence on the polarization of the input signal may occur (typically < 0.5&nbsp;dB). This is called Polarization Dependent Gain (PDG).\nThe absorption and emission cross sections of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites.  The random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the signal field produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers \u2013 i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not. \nIn an ideal doped fiber without [[birefringence]], the PDG would be inconveniently large. Fortunately, in optical fibers small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes. These two combined effects (which in transmission fibers give rise to [[polarization mode dispersion]]) produce a misalignment of the relative polarizations of the signal and pump lasers along the fiber, thus tending to average out the PDG. The result is that PDG is very difficult to observe in a single amplifier (but is noticeable in links with several cascaded amplifiers).\n\n=== Erbium-doped optical fiber amplifiers ===\n\nThe erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most deployed fiber amplifier as its amplification window coincides with the third transmission window of silica-based optical fiber.\n\nTwo bands have developed in the third transmission window \u2013 the ''Conventional'', or C-band, from approximately 1525&nbsp;nm \u2013 1565&nbsp;nm, and the ''Long'', or L-band, from approximately 1570&nbsp;nm to 1610&nbsp;nm.  Both of these bands can be amplified by EDFAs, but it is normal to use two different amplifiers, each optimized for one of the bands.\n\nThe principal difference between C- and L-band amplifiers is that a longer length of doped fiber is used in L-band amplifiers.  The longer length of fiber allows a lower inversion level to be used, thereby giving at longer wavelengths (due to the band-structure of Erbium in silica) while still providing a useful amount of gain.\n\nEDFAs have two commonly used pumping bands \u2013 980&nbsp;nm and 1480&nbsp;nm.  The 980&nbsp;nm band has a higher absorption cross-section and is generally used where low-noise performance is required.  The absorption band is relatively narrow and so wavelength stabilised laser sources are typically needed.  The 1480&nbsp;nm band has a lower, but broader, absorption cross-section and is generally used for higher power amplifiers.  A combination of 980&nbsp;nm and 1480&nbsp;nm pumping is generally utilised in amplifiers.\n\nGain and lasing in Erbium-doped fibers were first demonstrated in 1986\u201387 by two groups; one including [[David N.

However, those regions have not seen any significant commercial use so far and so those amplifiers have not been the subject of as much development as the EDFA. However, [[Ytterbium]] doped fiber lasers and amplifiers, operating near 1 micrometre wavelength, have many applications in industrial processing of materials, as these devices can be made with extremely high output power (tens of kilowatts).\n\n==Semiconductor optical amplifier==<!--Semiconductor optical amplifier redirects here-->\nSemiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are amplifiers which use a semiconductor to provide the gain medium.<ref>M. J. Connolly, Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers. Boston, MA: Springer-Verlag, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-7657-6}}</ref> These amplifiers have a similar structure to [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot]] [[laser diodes]] but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings and tilted [[wave guide]] and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which is greater than the gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-P\u00e9rot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry in order to reduce the power density on the output facet.\n\nSemiconductor optical amplifiers are typically made from group III-V compound semiconductors such as [[GaAs]]/AlGaAs, [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/[[InGaAs]], [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InGaAsP and [[Indium phosphide|InP]]/InAlGaAs, though any direct band gap semiconductors such as II-VI could conceivably be used. Such amplifiers are often used in telecommunication systems in the form of fiber-pigtailed components, operating at signal wavelengths between 850&nbsp;nm and 1600&nbsp;nm and generating gains of up to 30&nbsp;dB.\n\nThe semiconductor optical amplifier is of small size and electrically pumped. It can be potentially less expensive than the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc. However, the performance is still not comparable with the EDFA. The SOA has higher noise, lower gain, moderate polarization dependence and high [[Nonlinear optics|nonlinear]]ity with fast transient time. The main advantage of SOA is that all four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and [[four wave mixing]]) can be conducted. Furthermore, SOA can be run with a low power laser.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ghosh|first1=B.|last2=Mukhopadhyay|first2=S.|title=All-Optical Wavelength encoded NAND and NOR Operations exploiting Semiconductor Optical Amplifier based Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Wavelength Converter and Phase Conjugation System|journal=Optics and Photonics Letters|volume=4|issue=2|pages=1\u20139|year=2011|doi=10.1142/S1793528811000172 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\nThis originates from the short nanosecond or less upper state lifetime, so that the gain reacts rapidly to changes of pump or signal power and the changes of gain also cause phase changes which can distort the signals.\nThis nonlinearity presents the most severe problem for optical communication applications. However it provides the possibility for gain in different wavelength regions from the EDFA. \"Linear optical amplifiers\" using gain-clamping techniques have been developed.\n\nHigh optical nonlinearity makes semiconductor amplifiers attractive for all optical signal processing like all-optical switching and wavelength conversion. There has been much research on semiconductor optical amplifiers as elements for optical signal processing, wavelength conversion, clock recovery, signal demultiplexing, and pattern recognition.\n\n===Vertical-cavity SOA===\nA recent addition to the SOA family is the vertical-cavity SOA (VCSOA). These devices are similar in structure to, and share many features with, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers ([[VCSEL]]s). The major difference when comparing VCSOAs and VCSELs is the reduced mirror reflectivity used in the amplifier cavity. With VCSOAs, reduced feedback is necessary to prevent the device from reaching lasing threshold. Due to the extremely short cavity length, and correspondingly thin gain medium, these devices exhibit very low single-pass gain (typically on the order of a few percent) and also a very large [[free spectral range]] (FSR). The small single-pass gain requires relatively high mirror reflectivity to boost the total signal gain. In addition to boosting the total signal gain, the use of the [[resonant cavity]] structure results in a very narrow gain bandwidth; coupled with the large FSR of the optical cavity, this effectively limits operation of the VCSOA to single-channel amplification. Thus, VCSOAs can be seen as amplifying filters.\n\nGiven their vertical-cavity geometry, VCSOAs are resonant cavity optical amplifiers that operate with the input/output signal entering/exiting normal to the wafer surface. In addition to their small size, the surface normal operation of VCSOAs leads to a number of advantages, including low power consumption, low noise figure, polarization insensitive gain, and the ability to fabricate high fill factor two-dimensional arrays on a single semiconductor chip. These devices are still in the early stages of research, though promising preamplifier results have been demonstrated. Further extensions to VCSOA technology are the demonstration of wavelength tunable devices. These MEMS-tunable vertical-cavity SOAs utilize a microelectromechanical systems ([[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]]) based tuning mechanism for wide and continuous tuning of the peak gain wavelength of the amplifier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineering.ucsb.edu/~memsucsb/Research/MT-VCSOA/MT-VCSOA.html|title=MEMS-Tunable Vertical-cavity SOA|website=Engineering.ucsb.edu|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref> SOAs have a more rapid gain response, which is in the order of 1 to 100 ps.\n\n===Tapered amplifiers===\nFor high output power and broader wavelength range, tapered amplifiers are used. These amplifiers consist of a lateral single-mode section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.\n\nTypical parameters:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hanel-photonics.com/tapered_amplifier.html |title=Tapered amplifiers \u2013 available wavelengths and output powers |publisher=Hanel Photonics |accessdate=Sep 26, 2014}}</ref>\n* wavelength range: 633 to 1480&nbsp;nm\n* input power: 10 to 50&nbsp;mW\n* output power: up to 3 W\n\n== Raman amplifier ==\n{{Main|Raman amplification}}\nIn a Raman amplifier, the signal is intensified by [[Raman amplification]]. Unlike the EDFA and SOA the amplification effect is achieved by a nonlinear interaction between the signal and a pump laser within an optical fiber.  There are two types of Raman amplifier: distributed and lumped. A distributed Raman amplifier is one in which the transmission fiber is utilised as the gain medium by multiplexing a pump wavelength with signal wavelength, while a lumped Raman amplifier utilises a dedicated, shorter length of fiber to provide amplification.  In the case of a lumped Raman amplifier, a highly nonlinear fiber with a small core is utilised to increase the interaction between signal and pump wavelengths, and thereby reduce the length of fiber required.\n\nThe pump light may be coupled into the transmission fiber in the same direction as the signal (co-directional pumping), in the opposite direction (contra-directional pumping) or both. Contra-directional pumping is more common as the transfer of noise from the pump to the signal is reduced.\n\nThe pump power required for Raman amplification is higher than that required by the EDFA, with in excess of 500&nbsp;mW being required to achieve useful levels of gain in a distributed amplifier.  Lumped amplifiers, where the pump light can be safely contained to avoid safety implications of high optical powers, may use over 1 W of optical power.\n\nThe principal advantage of Raman amplification is its ability to provide distributed amplification within the transmission fiber, thereby increasing the length of spans between amplifier and [[Signal regeneration|regeneration]] sites.  The amplification bandwidth of Raman amplifiers is defined by the pump wavelengths utilised and so amplification can be provided over wider, and different, regions than may be possible with other amplifier types which rely on dopants and device design to define the amplification 'window'.\n\nRaman amplifiers have some fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, which provides a cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2\u00b5m. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines can be used to increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification is that it is a relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide wavelength range.<ref name=\"Optical Amplifier Tutorial\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiberstore.com/Optical-Amplifier-Tutorial-aid-359.html|title=Optical Amplifier Tutorial - FS.COM|first=FiberStore|last=Team|website=Fiberstore.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, a number of challenges for Raman amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a fast response time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.<ref name=\"Optical Amplifier Tutorial\"/>\n\n''Note: The text of an earlier version of this article was taken from the public domain [[Federal Standard 1037C]].''\n\n== Optical parametric amplifier ==\nAn [[optical parametric amplifier]] allows the amplification of a weak signal-impulse in a [[Centrosymmetry|noncentrosymmetric]] nonlinear medium (e.g. [[Beta barium borate]] (BBO)). In contrast to the previously mentioned amplifiers, which are mostly used in telecommunication environments, this type finds its main application in expanding the frequency tunability of ultrafast [[solid-state laser]]s (e.g. [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:sapphire]]). By using a [[Collinear|noncollinear]] interaction geometry optical parametric amplifiers are capable of extremely broad amplification bandwidths.\n\n== Recent achievements ==\nThe adoption of high power [[fiber laser]]s as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing for several years and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5&nbsp;kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications have steadily progressed in the last few years from a few Watts of output power, initially to the tens of Watts and now into the hundreds of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the adoption of stimulated [[brillouin scattering]] (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design including large mode area (LMA) fibers with a low-aperture core <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koplow|first=Jeffrey P.|last2=Kliner|first2=Dahv A.
