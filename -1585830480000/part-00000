Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech.

Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff, and could be triggered automatically or manually.  At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracts its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords are sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle.  After the bolts attached at the structural attachments are sheared, the external tank separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the external tank to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The external tank was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.<ref name=etuse>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19940004970_1994004970.pdf NASA-CR-195281, \"Utilization of the external tanks of the space transportation system\"].

The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]]. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], Spacelab, and the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]].  Beginning with [[STS-74]], the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the [[Mir space station]].

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate.<ref name=challenger_report_ch3>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch3.htm |title= Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter III: The Accident |publisher=NASA |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 14, 2020}}</ref> Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings' safety when the temperature was below 53&nbsp;\u00b0F (12&nbsp;\u00b0C) had been ignored by NASA managers.<ref name=challenger_report_ch6>{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |publisher=Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident |date= June 6, 1986 |accessdate= March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn February 1, 2003, ''Columbia'' disintegrated during re-entry, killing its crew of seven, because of damage to the [[Reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon]] leading edge of the wing caused during launch.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned. ''Discovery'' was the first of NASA's three remaining operational Space Shuttles to be retired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |title=NASA\u2014NASA's Shuttle and Rocket Launch Schedule |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate= July 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe final Space Shuttle mission was originally scheduled for late 2010, but the program was later extended to July 2011 when Michael Suffredini of the ISS program said that one additional trip was needed in 2011 to deliver parts to the International Space Station.<ref>{{cite web |first=John|last= Pike |url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/library/news/2010/space-100506-rianovosti01.htm |title=Space Shuttle may continue through next year\u2014Roscosmos |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 7, 2010}}</ref> [[STS-135]] launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/launch/index.html |title= Launch and Landing |publisher=NASA |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Distribution of orbiters and other hardware===\nNASA announced it would transfer orbiters to education institutions or museums at the conclusion of the Space Shuttle program.

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

Committees of scientists and engineers are often involved in the planning of governmental and corporate research programs, including those devoted to the development of military technologies and weaponry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = F | year = 1972 | title = \"'\"Social ethics and the conduct of science \u2013 Specialization and the fragmentation of responsibility | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 196 | issue = 4| pages = 213\u2013222 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = M | year = 1971 | title = Social responsibility (II) \u2014 The classical scientific ethic and strategic-weapons development | url = | journal = Impact of Science on Society | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 123\u2013136 }}</ref> Many professional societies and national organizations, such as the [[National Academy of Science]] and the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the United States, have ethical guidelines (see [[Engineering ethics]] and [[Research ethics]] for the conduct of scientific research and engineering).<ref>National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, ''On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research'', The National Academies Press, 1995, http://www.nap.edu</ref> There is recognition that scientists and engineers, both individually and collectively, have a special and much greater responsibility than average citizens with respect to the generation and use of scientific knowledge.\n\nIt has been pointed out that the situation is, unfortunately, not that simple and scientists and engineers should not be blamed for all the evils created by new scientific knowledge and technological innovations.<ref name=\"auto\"/> First, there is the common problem of fragmentation and diffusion of responsibility. Because of the intellectual and physical division of labor, the resulting fragmentation of knowledge, the high degree of specialization, and the complex and hierarchical decision-making process within corporations and government research laboratories, it is exceedingly difficult for individual scientists and engineers to control the applications of their innovations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = F | year = 1972 | title = Social ethics and the conduct of science \u2013 Specialization and the fragmentation of responsibility | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 196 | issue = 4| pages = 213\u2013222 }}</ref> This fragmentation of both work and decision-making results in fragmented moral accountability, often to the point where \"everybody involved was responsible but none could be held responsible.\"<ref>Lowrance, W.W. (1985). ''Modern science and human values'', Oxford University Press, p. 75.</ref>\n\nAnother problem is ignorance. The scientists and engineers cannot predict how their newly generated knowledge and technological innovations may be abused or misused for destructive purposes in the near or distant future. While the excuse of ignorance is somewhat acceptable for those scientists involved in very basic and fundamental research where potential applications cannot be even envisioned, the excuse of ignorance is much weaker for scientists and engineers involved in applied scientific research and technological innovation since the work objectives are well known. For example, most corporations conduct research on specific products or services that promise to yield the greatest possible profit for share-holders. Similarly, most of the research funded by governments is mission-oriented, such as protecting the environment, developing new drugs, or designing more lethal weapons. In all cases where the application of scientific knowledge and technological innovation is well known ''a priori'', it is impossible for a scientist or engineer to escape responsibility for research and technological innovation that is morally dubious.<ref>Ravetz, J.R. (1996). ''Scientific knowledge and its social problems'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, p. 415.</ref> As John Forge writes in ''Moral Responsibility and the Ignorant Scientist'': \"Ignorance is not an excuse precisely because scientists can be blamed for being ignorant.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Forge | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = Moral responsibility and the ignorant scientist | url = | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 341\u2013349 }}</ref>\n\nAnother point of view is that responsibility falls on those who provide the funding for the research and technological developments, which in most cases are corporations and government agencies. Furthermore, because taxpayers provide indirectly the funds for government-sponsored research, they and the politicians that represent them, i.e., society at large, should be held accountable for the uses and abuses of science.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beckwith | first1 = J. | last2 = Huang | first2 = F. | year = 2005 | title = Should we make a fuss?

(1971). \"Social responsibility (II) \u2014 The classical scientific ethic and strategic-weapons development\", ''Impact of Science on Society'', 21(2):123\u2013136.</ref> Many professional societies and national organizations, such as the [[National Academy of Science]] and the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the United States, have ethical guidelines (see [[Engineering ethics]] and [[Research ethics]] for the conduct of scientific research and engineering).<ref>National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine, ''On Being a Scientist: Responsible Conduct in Research'', The National Academies Press, 1995, http://www.nap.edu</ref> There is recognition that scientists and engineers, both individually and collectively, have a special and much greater responsibility than average citizens with respect to the generation and use of scientific knowledge.\n\nIt has been pointed out that the situation is, unfortunately, not that simple and scientists and engineers should not be blamed for all the evils created by new scientific knowledge and technological innovations.<ref name=\"auto\"/> First, there is the common problem of fragmentation and diffusion of responsibility. Because of the intellectual and physical division of labor, the resulting fragmentation of knowledge, the high degree of specialization, and the complex and hierarchical decision-making process within corporations and government research laboratories, it is exceedingly difficult for individual scientists and engineers to control the applications of their innovations.<ref>Collins, F. (1972). \"Social ethics and the conduct of science \u2013 Specialization and the fragmentation of responsibility\", ''Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences'', 196(4):213\u2013222.</ref> This fragmentation of both work and decision-making results in fragmented moral accountability, often to the point where \"everybody involved was responsible but none could be held responsible.\"<ref>Lowrance, W.W. (1985). ''Modern science and human values'', Oxford University Press, p. 75.</ref>\n\nAnother problem is ignorance. The scientists and engineers cannot predict how their newly generated knowledge and technological innovations may be abused or misused for destructive purposes in the near or distant future. While the excuse of ignorance is somewhat acceptable for those scientists involved in very basic and fundamental research where potential applications cannot be even envisioned, the excuse of ignorance is much weaker for scientists and engineers involved in applied scientific research and technological innovation since the work objectives are well known. For example, most corporations conduct research on specific products or services that promise to yield the greatest possible profit for share-holders. Similarly, most of the research funded by governments is mission-oriented, such as protecting the environment, developing new drugs, or designing more lethal weapons. In all cases where the application of scientific knowledge and technological innovation is well known ''a priori'', it is impossible for a scientist or engineer to escape responsibility for research and technological innovation that is morally dubious.<ref>Ravetz, J.R. (1996). ''Scientific knowledge and its social problems'', New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NJ, p. 415.</ref> As John Forge writes in ''Moral Responsibility and the Ignorant Scientist'': \"Ignorance is not an excuse precisely because scientists can be blamed for being ignorant.\"<ref>Forge, J. (2000). \"Moral responsibility and the ignorant scientist\",  ''Science and Engineering Ethics'', 6(3):341\u2013349.</ref>\n\nAnother point of view is that responsibility falls on those who provide the funding for the research and technological developments, which in most cases are corporations and government agencies. Furthermore, because taxpayers provide indirectly the funds for government-sponsored research, they and the politicians that represent them, i.e., society at large, should be held accountable for the uses and abuses of science.<ref>Beckwith, J., and F. Huang. (2005). \"Should we make a fuss? A case for social ''Nature Biotechnology'', 23(12):1479\u20131480.</ref> Compared to earlier times when scientists could often conduct their own research independently, today's experimental research requires expensive laboratories and instrumentation, making scientists dependent on those who pay for their studies.\n\nQuasi-legal instruments, or [[soft law]] principle has received some normative status in relation to private and public corporations in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) ''Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights'' developed by the UNESCO [[International Bioethics Committee]] particularly in relation to child and maternal welfare.<ref>Faucet TA and Nasty H.

{"title_page": "Social accounting", "text_new": "'''Social accounting''' (also known as ''[[social accounting and auditing]]'', ''[[social accountability]]'', ''social and environmental accounting'', ''corporate social reporting'', ''corporate social responsibility reporting'', ''non-financial reporting'' or ''accounting'') is the process of communicating the social and environmental effects of organizations' economic actions to particular interest groups within society and to society at large.<ref>R.H. Gray, D.L. Owen & K.T. Maunders, ''Corporate Social Reporting: Accounting and accountability'' (Hemel Hempstead: Prentice Hall, 1987)p. IX.</ref> Social Accounting is different from [[public interest accounting]] as well as from  [[critical accounting]].\n\nSocial accounting is commonly used in the context of business, or [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR), although any organisation, including [[NGO]]s, [[charities]], and [[government agencies]] may engage in social accounting. Social Accounting can also be used in conjunction with [[community-based monitoring]] (CBM).\n\nSocial accounting emphasises the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. D. Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as \"an approach to reporting a firm\u2019s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behaviour, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques.\"<ref>D. Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'' (London: Financial Times Prentice Hall, 2000), p. 20.</ref> It is an important step in helping companies independently develop CSR programs which are shown to be much more effective than government mandated CSR.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=J.

Environmental accounting may account for an organisation's impact on the [[natural environment]]. [[Sustainability accounting]] is the quantitative analysis of social and economic [[sustainability]]. [[National accounting]] uses [[economics]] as a method of analysis.<ref name=\"Ruggles\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ruggles | first1 = Nancy D. | year = 1987 | title = social accounting | url = | journal = [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]] | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 377\u201382 }}</ref> The International Standards Organization (ISO) provides a standard, ISO 26000, that is a resource for social accounting. It addresses the seven core areas to be assessed for social responsibility accounting. <ref>ISO 26000 Social Responsibility Guidance. (2010).  (I. T. T. M. Board Ed. 1 ed.).</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nSocial accounting challenges conventional accounting, in particular [[financial accounting]], for giving a narrow image of the interaction between society and organizations, and thus artificially constraining the subject of accounting.\n\nSocial accounting, a largely [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] concept, seeks to broaden the scope of accounting in the sense that it should:\n* concern itself with more than only economic events;\n* not be exclusively expressed in financial terms;\n* be accountable to a broader group of stakeholders;\n* broaden its purpose beyond reporting financial success.\n\nIt points to the fact that companies influence their external environment ( some times positively and many times\nnegatively) through their actions and should, therefore, account for these effects as part of their standard\naccounting practices. Social accounting is in this sense closely related to the economic concept of externality.\n\nSocial accounting offers an alternative account of significant economic entities. It has the \"potential to expose the tension between pursuing economic profit and the pursuit of social and environmental objectives\".<ref name=\"Gray_etal_1996_ch1\">Gray R.H., D.L. Owen & C. Adams (1996) Accounting and Accountability: Changes and Challenges in Corporate Social and Environmental Reporting (London: Prentice Hall), Ch 1</ref>\n\nThe purpose of social accounting can be approached from two different angles, namely for management control purposes or accountability purposes.\n\n===Accountability vs authority===\n\nSocial accounting for accountability purposes is designed to support and facilitate the pursuit of society's objectives. \nThese objectives can be manifold but can typically be described in terms of social and environmental desirability and [[sustainability]]. In order to make informed choices on these objectives, the flow of information in society in general, and in accounting in particular, needs to cater to democratic decision-making. In democratic systems, Gray argues, there must then be flows of information in which those controlling the resources provide accounts to society of their use of those resources: a system of corporate accountability.<ref>Gray ''et al.'' (1996), esp Ch 3.</ref>\n\nSociety is seen to profit from implementing a social and environmental approach to accounting in a number of ways, e.g.:\n\n* Honoring stakeholders' [[rights of information]];\n* Balancing [[corporate power]] with [[corporate responsibility]];\n* Increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of corporate activity;\n* Identifying social and [[environmental cost]]s of economic success.\n\n===Management control===\nSocial accounting for the purpose of management control is designed to support and facilitate the achievement of an organization's own objectives.<br /> \nBecause social accounting is concerned with substantial self-reporting on a systemic level, individual reports are often referred to as social audits.  The first complete internal model for social accounting and audit, 1981, was designed for social enterprises to help plan and measure their social, environmental and financial progress towards achieving their planned objectives.<ref>Freer Spreckley, [http://www.locallivelihoods.com/cmsms/uploads/PDFs/Social%20Audit%20Toolkit%20-%204th%20Edition%202008.pdf Social Audit Toolkit]</ref>\n\nOrganizations are seen to benefit from implementing social accounting practices in a number of ways, e.g.:<ref>See R.H. Gray, 'Current Developments and Trends in Social and Environmental Auditing, Reporting & Attestation', International Journal of Auditing 4(3) (2000): pp247-268</ref><ref>Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'', esp Ch 2.</ref>\n\n* Increased information for decision-making;\n* Enhanced image management and [[Public Relations]];\n* Identification of social responsibilities;\n* Identification of market development opportunities;\n* Maintaining [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]].\n\nAccording to [[Business in the Community|BITC]] the \"process of reporting on responsible businesses performance to stakeholders\" (i.e. social accounting) helps integrate such practices into business practices, as well as identifying future risks and opportunities.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html Corporate responsibility reporting - Business in the Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815220804/http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html |date=August 15, 2008 }}</ref> The management control view thus focuses on the individual organization.\n\nCritics of this approach point out that the benign nature of companies is assumed. Here, responsibility, and accountability, is largely left in the hands of the organization concerned.<ref>Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 17.</ref>\n\n==Scope==\n\n===Formal accountability===\n\nIn social accounting the focus tends to be on larger organisations such as [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), and their visible, external accounts rather than informally produced accounts or accounts for internal use. The need for formality in making MNCs accountability is given by the spatial, financial and cultural distance of these organisations to those who are affecting and affected by it.<ref name=\"Gray_etal_1996_ch1\"/>\n\nSocial accounting also questions the reduction of all meaningful information to financial form. Financial data is seen as only one element of the accounting language.<ref>See M.R. Mathews,'Towards a Mega-Theory of Accounting' in: Gray and Guthrie, ''Social Accounting, Mega Accounting and Beyond: A Festschrift in Honour of MR Mathews'' (CSEAR Publishing, 2007).</ref>\n\n===Self-reporting and third party audits===\nIn most countries, existing legislation only regulates a fraction of accounting for socially relevant corporate activity. In consequence, most available social, environmental and sustainability reports are [[voluntary disclosure|produced voluntarily]] by organisations and in that sense often resemble [[financial statements]]. While companies' efforts in this regard are usually commended, there seems to be a tension between voluntary reporting and accountability, for companies are likely to produce reports favouring their interests.<ref name=\"Gray_2001\">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/1467-8608.00207 |title=Thirty Years of Social Accounting, Reporting and Auditing: what (if anything) have we learnt? |author=R.H.

This was the basis for the Co-operative Bank and Shell Corporation's social performance reports in the UK and subsequently many other private sector companies social responsibility reporting.\n\n[[Abt Associates]], the American consultancy firm, is one of the most cited early examples of businesses that experimented with social accounting. In the 1970s Abt Associates conducted a series of social audits incorporated into its annual reports. The social concerns addressed included \"productivity, contribution to knowledge, employment security, fairness of employment opportunities, health, education and self-development, physical security, transportation, recreation, and environment\".<ref>Abt Associates Annual Report and Social Audit 1974, quoted in D. Blake, W. Frederick, M.

Gray, D.L. Owen & K.T. Maunders, ''Corporate Social Reporting: Accounting and accountability'' (Hemel Hempstead: Prentice Hall, 1987)p. IX.</ref> Social Accounting is different from [[public interest accounting]] as well as from  [[critical accounting]].\n\nSocial accounting is commonly used in the context of business, or [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR), although any organisation, including [[NGO]]s, [[charities]], and [[government agencies]] may engage in social accounting. Social Accounting can also be used in conjunction with [[community-based monitoring]] (CBM).\n\nSocial accounting emphasises the notion of corporate [[accountability]]. D. Crowther defines social accounting in this sense as \"an approach to reporting a firm\u2019s activities which stresses the need for the identification of socially relevant behaviour, the determination of those to whom the company is accountable for its social performance and the development of appropriate measures and reporting techniques.\"<ref>D.

Environmental accounting may account for an organisation's impact on the [[natural environment]]. [[Sustainability accounting]] is the quantitative analysis of social and economic [[sustainability]]. [[National accounting]] uses [[economics]] as a method of analysis.<ref name=\"Ruggles\">Nancy  D. Ruggles, 1987. \"social accounting,\" ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 4, pp. 377\u201382.</ref> The International Standards Organization (ISO) provides a standard, ISO 26000, that is a resource for social accounting. It addresses the seven core areas to be assessed for social responsibility accounting. <ref>ISO 26000 Social Responsibility Guidance. (2010).  (I. T. T. M. Board Ed. 1 ed.).</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nSocial accounting challenges conventional accounting, in particular [[financial accounting]], for giving a narrow image of the interaction between society and organizations, and thus artificially constraining the subject of accounting.\n\nSocial accounting, a largely [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] concept, seeks to broaden the scope of accounting in the sense that it should:\n* concern itself with more than only economic events;\n* not be exclusively expressed in financial terms;\n* be accountable to a broader group of stakeholders;\n* broaden its purpose beyond reporting financial success.\n\nIt points to the fact that companies influence their external environment ( some times positively and many times\nnegatively) through their actions and should, therefore, account for these effects as part of their standard\naccounting practices. Social accounting is in this sense closely related to the economic concept of externality.\n\nSocial accounting offers an alternative account of significant economic entities. It has the \"potential to expose the tension between pursuing economic profit and the pursuit of social and environmental objectives\".<ref name=\"Gray_etal_1996_ch1\">Gray R.H., D.L. Owen & C. Adams (1996) Accounting and Accountability: Changes and Challenges in Corporate Social and Environmental Reporting (London: Prentice Hall), Ch 1</ref>\n\nThe purpose of social accounting can be approached from two different angles, namely for management control purposes or accountability purposes.\n\n===Accountability vs authority===\n\nSocial accounting for accountability purposes is designed to support and facilitate the pursuit of society's objectives. \nThese objectives can be manifold but can typically be described in terms of social and environmental desirability and [[sustainability]]. In order to make informed choices on these objectives, the flow of information in society in general, and in accounting in particular, needs to cater to democratic decision-making. In democratic systems, Gray argues, there must then be flows of information in which those controlling the resources provide accounts to society of their use of those resources: a system of corporate accountability.<ref>Gray ''et al.'' (1996), esp Ch 3.</ref>\n\nSociety is seen to profit from implementing a social and environmental approach to accounting in a number of ways, e.g.:\n\n* Honoring stakeholders' [[rights of information]];\n* Balancing [[corporate power]] with [[corporate responsibility]];\n* Increasing [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of corporate activity;\n* Identifying social and [[environmental cost]]s of economic success.\n\n===Management control===\nSocial accounting for the purpose of management control is designed to support and facilitate the achievement of an organization's own objectives.<br /> \nBecause social accounting is concerned with substantial self-reporting on a systemic level, individual reports are often referred to as social audits.  The first complete internal model for social accounting and audit, 1981, was designed for social enterprises to help plan and measure their social, environmental and financial progress towards achieving their planned objectives.<ref>Freer Spreckley, [http://www.locallivelihoods.com/cmsms/uploads/PDFs/Social%20Audit%20Toolkit%20-%204th%20Edition%202008.pdf Social Audit Toolkit]</ref>\n\nOrganizations are seen to benefit from implementing social accounting practices in a number of ways, e.g.:<ref>See R.H. Gray, 'Current Developments and Trends in Social and Environmental Auditing, Reporting & Attestation', International Journal of Auditing 4(3) (2000): pp247-268</ref><ref>Crowther, ''Social and Environmental Accounting'', esp Ch 2.</ref>\n\n* Increased information for decision-making;\n* Enhanced image management and [[Public Relations]];\n* Identification of social responsibilities;\n* Identification of market development opportunities;\n* Maintaining [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]].\n\nAccording to [[Business in the Community|BITC]] the \"process of reporting on responsible businesses performance to stakeholders\" (i.e. social accounting) helps integrate such practices into business practices, as well as identifying future risks and opportunities.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html Corporate responsibility reporting - Business in the Community] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815220804/http://www.bitc.org.uk/take_action/responsible_business/reporting/index.html |date=August 15, 2008 }}</ref> The management control view thus focuses on the individual organization.\n\nCritics of this approach point out that the benign nature of companies is assumed. Here, responsibility, and accountability, is largely left in the hands of the organization concerned.<ref>Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 17.</ref>\n\n==Scope==\n\n===Formal accountability===\n\nIn social accounting the focus tends to be on larger organisations such as [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), and their visible, external accounts rather than informally produced accounts or accounts for internal use. The need for formality in making MNCs accountability is given by the spatial, financial and cultural distance of these organisations to those who are affecting and affected by it.<ref name=\"Gray_etal_1996_ch1\"/>\n\nSocial accounting also questions the reduction of all meaningful information to financial form. Financial data is seen as only one element of the accounting language.<ref>See M.R. Mathews,'Towards a Mega-Theory of Accounting' in: Gray and Guthrie, ''Social Accounting, Mega Accounting and Beyond: A Festschrift in Honour of MR Mathews'' (CSEAR Publishing, 2007).</ref>\n\n===Self-reporting and third party audits===\nIn most countries, existing legislation only regulates a fraction of accounting for socially relevant corporate activity. In consequence, most available social, environmental and sustainability reports are [[voluntary disclosure|produced voluntarily]] by organisations and in that sense often resemble [[financial statements]]. While companies' efforts in this regard are usually commended, there seems to be a tension between voluntary reporting and accountability, for companies are likely to produce reports favouring their interests.<ref name=\"Gray_2001\">{{cite journal |doi= 10.1111/1467-8608.00207 |title=Thirty Years of Social Accounting, Reporting and Auditing: what (if anything) have we learnt? |author=R.H.

For example, [[H&M]], asks stakeholders how they would like to receive reports on its website; [[Vodafone]] publishes separate reports for 11 of its operating companies as well as publishing an internal report in 2005; [[Weyerhaeuser]] produced a tabloid-size, four-page mini-report in addition to its full sustainability report.<ref>[http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=4772 Ethical Corporation: Report Reviews - Reporting review of the year \u2013 Corporate responsibility reporting \u2013 The best of times, the worst of times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821060832/http://www.ethicalcorp.com/content.asp?ContentID=4772 |date=August 21, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nModern forms of social accounting first produced widespread interest in the 1970s. Its concepts received serious consideration from professional and academic accounting bodies, e.g. the [[Accounting Standards Board]]'s predecessor, the [[American Accounting Association]] and the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]].<ref>See Accounting Standards Committee, ''The Corporate Report'' (London: ICAEW, 1975.)</ref><ref>American Accounting Association, 'Report of the Committee on Human Resource Accounting', ''The Accounting Review Supplement to Vol. XLVIII''.</ref><ref>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, ''The Measurement of Corporate Social Performance'' (New York: AICPA, 1977).</ref>\nBusiness-representative bodies, e.g. the [[Confederation of British Industry]], likewise approached the issue.<ref>Confederation of British Industry. ''The Responsibility of the British Public Company'' (London: CBI, 1971).</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Freer Spreckley produced a short book entitled ''Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working''<ref>Freer Spreckley, ''[http://www.locallivelihoods.com/cmsms/uploads/PDFs/Social%20Audit%20-%20A%20Management%20Tool.pdf Social Audit - A Management Tool for Co-operative Working].</ref> designed as an internal organisational social accounting and audit model specifically for social enterprises who wished to measure their social, environmental and financial performance.  This was the basis for the Co-operative Bank and Shell Corporation's social performance reports in the UK and subsequently many other private sector companies social responsibility reporting.\n\n[[Abt Associates]], the American consultancy firm, is one of the most cited early examples of businesses that experimented with social accounting. In the 1970s Abt Associates conducted a series of social audits incorporated into its annual reports. The social concerns addressed included \"productivity, contribution to knowledge, employment security, fairness of employment opportunities, health, education and self-development, physical security, transportation, recreation, and environment\".<ref>Abt Associates Annual Report and Social Audit 1974, quoted in D. Blake, W. Frederick, M. Myers, ''Social Auditing'', (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1976), p.149.\n</ref> The social audits expressed Abt Associates performance in this areas in financial terms and thus aspired to determine the company's net social impact in balance sheet form.<ref>R. A. Bauer and D. H. Fenn, What is a corporate social audit?, Harvard Business Review, 1973, pp.42-43.</ref> Other examples of early applications include Laventhol and Horwath, then a reputable accounting firm, and the First National Bank of Minneapolis (now U.S. Bancorp).<ref>Blake et al., ''Social Auditing'', p. 149. '</ref>\n\nYet social accounting practices were only rarely codified in legislation; notable exceptions include the French [[bilan social]] and the British [[2006 Companies Act]].<ref>Gray, 'Current Developments', p. 5.</ref><ref>[http://www.trucost.com/pressreleases/CompaniesAct.html Press Release - Changes to the Companies Act 2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Interest in social accounting cooled off in the 1980s and was only resurrected in the mid-1990s, partly nurtured by growing ecological and environmental awareness.<ref name=\"Gray_2001\"/>{{rp|9}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Accountancy]]\n* [[AccountAbility (Institute of Social and Ethical AccountAbility)]]\n* [[Centre for Social and Environmental Accounting Research]]\n* [[Corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Corporate sustainability]]\n* [[Environmental audit]]\n* [[Environmental economics]]\n* [[Global Reporting Initiative]]\n* [[Human resource accounting]]\n* [[Natural resource economics]]\n* [[National accounts]]\n* [[Robert Hugh Gray]]\n* [[Socially responsible investing]]\n* [[Social return on investment]]\n* [[Stakeholder (corporate)]]\n* [[Sustainability]]\n* [[Sustainability measurement]]\n* [[United Nations Global Compact]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite news|title=Fast and Flawed Inspections of Factories Abroad|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 2, 2013|author=Clifford, Stephanie|author2=Steven Greenhouse|page=A1 ff}}\n* Amat, O., & Gowthorpe, C.
