An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

The [[Greater Poland uprising (1846)|Greater Poland uprising]] ended in a fiasco in early 1846. In the [[Krak\u00f3w uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow]] into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units. This resulted in the [[Galician slaughter]] of 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> a large-scale rebellion of [[serfdom|serf]]s seeking relief from their post-feudal condition of [[Serfdom in Poland|mandatory labor]] as practiced in ''[[folwark]]s''. The uprising freed many from bondage and hastened decisions that led to the [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|abolition of Polish serfdom]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1848. A new wave of Polish involvement in revolutionary movements soon took place in the partitions and in other parts of Europe in the context of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]] revolutions of 1848 (e.g. [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]'s participation in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutions in Austria]] and [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungary]]). The 1848 [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|German revolutions]] precipitated the [[Greater Poland uprising (1848)|Greater Poland uprising of 1848]],<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> in which peasants in the Prussian Partition, who were by then largely enfranchised, played a prominent role.<ref name=\"Gierowski 232\u2013287\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=232\u2013287}}.</ref>\n\n====The Uprising of January 1863====\n\n[[File:Romuald Traugutt 111.PNG|thumb|upright|right|[[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the [[January Uprising|1863 Uprising]]]]\n\nAs a matter of continuous policy, the Russian autocracy kept assailing Polish national core values of language, religion and culture.<ref name=\"Burant 131\u2013156\">{{Harvnb|Burant|1985|pp=131\u2013156}}.</ref> In consequence, despite the limited liberalization measures allowed in [[Congress Poland]] under the rule of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], a renewal of popular liberation activities took place in 1860\u20131861. During large-scale demonstrations in Warsaw, Russian forces inflicted numerous casualties on the civilian participants. The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals. In order to cripple the manpower potential of the Reds, [[Aleksander Wielopolski]], the conservative leader of the government of Congress Poland, arranged for a partial selective conscription of young Poles for the Russian army in the years 1862 and 1863.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> This action hastened the outbreak of hostilities. The [[January Uprising]], joined and led after the initial period by the Whites, was fought by partisan units against an overwhelmingly advantaged enemy. The uprising lasted from January 1863 to the spring of 1864,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> when [[Romuald Traugutt]], the last supreme commander of the insurgency, was captured by the tsarist police.<ref name=\"Gierowski 287\u2013311\">{{Harvnb|Gierowski|1986b|pp=287\u2013311}}.</ref><ref name=\"Biel, czerwie\u0144, czer\u0144\">{{Harvnb|Zdrada|2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1864, the Russian authority, compelled by the uprising to compete for the loyalty of Polish peasants, officially published an [[Abolition of serfdom in Poland|enfranchisement decree in Congress Poland]] along the lines of an earlier land reform proclamation of the insurgents. The act created the conditions necessary for the development of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system on central Polish lands.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government. The [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (an [[academy of sciences]]) was founded in Krak\u00f3w in 1872.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/>\n\nSocial activities termed \"[[organic work]]\" consisted of self-help organizations that promoted economic advancement and work on improving the competitiveness of Polish-owned businesses, industrial, agricultural or other. New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education. Scientific and educational societies were active in a number of cities. Such activities were most pronounced in the Prussian Partition.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref>\n\n[[Positivism in Poland]] replaced Romanticism as the leading intellectual, social and literary trend.<ref name=\"Lukowski 182\u2013187\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=182\u2013187}}.</ref><ref name=\"Lukowski 192\u2013194\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=192\u2013194}}.</ref> It reflected the ideals and values of the emerging urban [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=66\u201367}}.</ref> Around 1890, the urban classes gradually abandoned the positivist ideas and came under the influence of modern pan-European [[nationalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|pp=297\u2013298}}.</ref>\n\n====Economic development and social change====\n\n[[File:Gierymski Feast of trumpets I.jpg|thumb|right|Many [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]] emigrated from the Polish\u2013Lithuanian lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but most remained to form a large [[Minority group|ethnic minority]]]]\n\nUnder the partitioning powers, economic diversification and progress, including large-scale [[industrialisation]], were introduced in the traditionally agrarian Polish lands, but this development turned out to be very uneven. Advanced agriculture was practiced in the Prussian Partition, except for [[Upper Silesia]], where the coal-mining industry created a large labor force. The densest network of railroads was built in German-ruled western Poland. In Russian Congress Poland, a striking growth of industry, railways and towns took place, all against the background of an extensive, but less productive agriculture.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=187\u2013192, 199}}.</ref> The industrial initiative, capital and know-how were provided largely by entrepreneurs who were not ethnic Poles.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wereszycki|1990|p=294}}.</ref> Warsaw (a metallurgical center) and [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (a textiles center) grew rapidly, as did the total proportion of urban population, making the region the most economically advanced in the Russian Empire (industrial production exceeded agricultural production there by 1909). The coming of the railways spurred some industrial growth even in the vast Russian Partition territories outside of Congress Poland. The Austrian Partition was rural and poor, except for the industrialized [[Cieszyn Silesia]] area. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad.

The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition.

The Stalinist attempts at establishing collective farms generally failed. Due to urbanization, the national percentage of the rural population decreased in communist Poland by about 50%.

The authorities responded with a major crackdown on opposition activity, including the firing of faculty and the dismissal of students at universities and other institutions of learning.

Using the context of the military victory of [[Israel]] in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, some in the Polish communist leadership waged an antisemitic campaign against the remnants of the Jewish community in Poland. The targets of this campaign were accused of disloyalty and active sympathy with Israeli aggression. Branded \"[[Zionism|Zionists]]\", they were scapegoated and blamed for the unrest in March 1968, which eventually led to the emigration of much of Poland's remaining Jewish population (about 15,000 Polish citizens left the country).<ref name=\"Poland under Communism 148-163\"/>\n\nWith the active support of the Gomu\u0142ka regime, the [[Polish People's Army]] took part in the infamous [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968, after the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was informally announced.<ref name=\"Poland under Communism 163-171\">{{Harvnb|Kemp-Welch|2008|pp=163\u2013171}}.</ref>\n\nIn the final major achievement of Gomu\u0142ka diplomacy, the governments of Poland and [[West Germany]] signed in December 1970 the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], which normalized their relations and made possible meaningful cooperation in a number of areas of bilateral interest.

The December 1989 Sejm statute of credit relations reform introduced an \"incredible\" system of privileges for banks, which were allowed to unilaterally alter interest rates on already existing contracts. The exceedingly high rates they instantly introduced ruined many previously profitable enterprises and caused a complete breakdown of the apartment block construction industry, which had long-term deleterious effects on the state budget as well.

After 1945, the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing and a considerable degree of popular support in Poland.

An inseparable part of [[western civilization]], Poland's intricate history extends from [[Lechites|ancient tribes]], [[Baptism of Poland|Catholic baptism]], [[Kingdom of Poland|rule of kings]], [[Polish Golden Age|cultural prosperity]], [[Polonization|expansionism]] and becoming one of the largest [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|European powers]] to its [[Partitions of Poland|collapse and partitions]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Polish People's Republic|communism]] and restoration of [[democracy]].   \n\nThe roots of Polish history are traced to the [[Iron Age]], when the territory of present-day Poland was settled by innumerable tribes, most notably [[Celts]], [[Scythians]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic clans]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Balts]]. However, it was the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] peoples or the ancient [[Lechites]], the closest ancestors of ethnic [[Poles]], who established permanent settlements in the [[geography of Poland|Polish lands]] during the [[Early Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"UzP 122-143\">{{Harvnb|Derwich|\u017burek|2002|pp=122\u2013143}}.</ref> Concurrently, the Lechitic tribe of [[Polans (western)|Western Polans]], meaning \"people living in open fields\", dominated the region and gave [[Name of Poland|Poland its name]] in reference to the generally flat [[North European Plain|North-Central European Plain]] on which the country is located.\n\nThe first ruling dynasty, the [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]], emerged in the 10th century AD. Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] is considered the ''de facto'' creator of the Polish state and is widely recognized for the [[Christianization of Poland|adoption of Western Christianity]] that followed his Catholic baptism in 966 AD. Mieszko's dominion was formally reconstituted as a [[High Middle Ages|medieval]] kingdom in 1025 by his son [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]], known for military expansion under his rule. The most successful and the last Piast monarch, [[Casimir III the Great]], presided over a brilliant period of economic prosperity and territorial aggrandizement before his death in 1370 without male heirs. The period of the [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] in the 14th\u201316th centuries brought close ties with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], a cultural [[Renaissance in Poland]] and continued territorial expansion as well as [[Polonization]] that culminated in the establishment of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1569, one of Europe's largest countries.\n\nThe Commonwealth was able to sustain the levels of prosperity achieved during the Jagiellonian period, while its political system matured as a unique [[Golden Liberty|noble democracy]] with an [[elective monarchy]]. From the mid-17th century, however, the huge state entered a period of decline caused by devastating wars and the deterioration of its political system. Significant internal reforms were introduced in the late 18th century, such as Europe's first [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]], but neighboring powers did not allow the reforms to advance. The existence of the Commonwealth ended in 1795 after a series of invasions and [[partitions of Poland|partitions of Polish territory]] carried out by the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. From 1795 until 1918, no truly independent Polish state existed, although strong [[Resistance movements in partitioned Poland (1795\u20131918)|Polish resistance movements]] operated. The opportunity to regain sovereignty only materialized after [[World War I]], when the three partitioning imperial powers were fatally weakened in the wake of war and revolution.\n\nThe [[Second Polish Republic]] was established in 1918 and existed as an independent state until 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], marking the beginning of [[World War II]]. Millions of Polish citizens of [[Untermensch|different faiths or identities]] perished in the course of the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupation of Poland]] between 1939 and 1945 through planned genocide and [[Holocaust|extermination]]. A [[Polish government-in-exile]] nonetheless functioned throughout the war and the [[Polish contribution to World War II|Poles contributed]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory through participation in military campaigns on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War II)|western]] fronts. The westward advances of the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1944 and 1945 compelled Nazi Germany's forces to retreat from Poland, which led to the establishment of a [[satellite state|satellite]] [[communism|communist]] country under Soviet influence, known from 1952 as the [[Polish People's Republic]].\n\nAs a result of territorial adjustments mandated by the Allies at the end of World War II in 1945, Poland's [[Territorial evolution of Poland|geographic centre of gravity shifted towards the west]] and the re-defined Polish lands largely lost their [[Demographic history of Poland|historic multi-ethnic character]] through the extermination, expulsion and migration of various [[ethnic group]]s during and after the war. By the late 1980s, the Polish reform movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] became crucial in bringing about a peaceful transition from a [[Planned economy|communist state]] to a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economic system and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]]. This process resulted in the creation of the [[History of Poland (1989\u2013present)|modern Polish state]], the Third Polish Republic, founded in 1989.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Prehistory and protohistory==\n\n{{further|Prehistory and protohistory of Poland|Poland in the Early Middle Ages}}\n\n[[File:Biskupin_brama_od_wewnatrz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement of the [[Lusatian culture]], 8th century BC]]\n\nIn [[prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[protohistory|protohistoric]] times, over a period of at least 500,000 years, the area of present-day Poland was intermittently inhabited by members of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]''.

In the [[Krak\u00f3w uprising]] of February 1846,<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> patriotic action was combined with revolutionary demands, but the result was the incorporation of the [[Free City of Cracow]] into the Austrian Partition. The Austrian officials took advantage of peasant discontent and incited villagers against the noble-dominated insurgent units.

The \"[[Reds (January Uprising)|Red]]\", or [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] faction of Polish activists, which promoted peasant enfranchisement and cooperated with Russian revolutionaries, became involved in immediate preparations for a national uprising. The \"[[Whites (January Uprising)|White]]\", or [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] faction, was inclined to cooperate with the Russian authorities and countered with partial reform proposals.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the \"Kingdom of Poland\" to the \"[[Vistula Land]]\" and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[German language|German]] languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression. Public education was increasingly subjected to [[Russification]] and [[Germanisation]] measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in the [[Polish language]] was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (western Ukraine and southern Poland) experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.  Economically and socially backward, it was under the milder rule of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]] and from 1867 was increasingly allowed limited autonomy.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> ''Sta\u0144czycy'', a conservative Polish pro-Austrian faction led by great land owners, dominated the Galician government.

New commercial methods of generating higher productivity were discussed and implemented through [[trade association]]s and special interest groups, while Polish banking and cooperative financial institutions made the necessary business loans available. The other major area of effort in organic work was educational and intellectual development of the common people. Many libraries and reading rooms were established in small towns and villages, and numerous printed periodicals manifested the growing interest in popular education.

[[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]n economic expansion after 1890 included oil extraction and resulted in the growth of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w, Lviv)]] and [[Krak\u00f3w]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\nEconomic and social changes involving [[land reform]] and industrialization, combined with the effects of foreign domination, altered the centuries-old social structure of Polish society. Among the newly emergent strata were wealthy industrialists and financiers, distinct from the traditional, but still critically important landed aristocracy. The [[intelligentsia]], an educated, professional or business [[middle class]], often originated from lower gentry, landless or alienated from their rural possessions, and from urban people. Many smaller agricultural enterprises based on serfdom did not survive the land reforms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=44}}.</ref> The industrial [[proletariat]], a new [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged]] class, was composed mainly of poor peasants or townspeople forced by deteriorating conditions to migrate and search for work in urban centers in their countries of origin or abroad.

The degree of industrialisation, relatively fast-paced in some areas, lagged behind the advanced regions of [[Western Europe]]. The three partitions developed different economies and were more economically integrated with their mother states than with each other. In the Prussian Partition, for example, agricultural production depended heavily on the German market, whereas the industrial sector of Congress Poland relied more on the Russian market.<ref name=\"Lukowski 187\u2013192, 199\"/>\n\n====Nationalism, socialism and other movements====\n\n[[File:RLuxemburgCpWz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Mariecurie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Marie Curie]], discoverer of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive elements]]]]\n\nIn the 1870s\u20131890s, large-scale [[socialism|socialist]], [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and other political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist [[Proletariat (party)|First Proletariat]] was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of [[National Democracy]]) in 1887, the [[Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia|Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia]] in 1890, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1892, the [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] in 1897. [[Christian democracy]] regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the [[Polish Christian Democratic Party]] in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including [[Ukrainians]], [[Lithuanians]], [[Belarusians]] and [[Jews]], were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on the part of those Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or the rise of a Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as [[Prometheism]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 194\u2013203\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=194\u2013203}}.</ref>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, the [[Young Poland]] [[cultural movement]], centered in [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] Galicia, took advantage of a milieu conducive to liberal expression in that region and was the source of Poland's finest artistic and literary productions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 207\u2013209\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=207\u2013209}}.</ref> In this same era, [[Marie Curie|Marie Sk\u0142odowska Curie]], a pioneer [[ionizing radiation|radiation]] scientist, performed her groundbreaking research in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 190\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|p=190}}.</ref>\n\n====The Revolution of 1905====\n\n[[File:Skoczylas Street demonstration.jpg|Demonstrators attacked during the [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]  [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u201307)|in Poland]]|thumb|left]]\n\n[[File:Roman Dmowski in color.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy]] ideology proved highly influential in Polish politics.

The revolt was part of much broader disturbances throughout the Russian Empire associated with the general [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]]. In Poland, the principal revolutionary figures were [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. Dmowski was associated with the right-wing nationalist movement [[National Democracy]], whereas Pi\u0142sudski was associated with the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. As the authorities re-established control within the Russian Empire, the revolt in Congress Poland, placed under martial law, withered as well, partially as a result of tsarist concessions in the areas of national and workers' rights, including Polish representation in the newly created Russian [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Duma]]. The collapse of the revolt in the Russian Partition, coupled with intensified Germanization in the Prussian Partition, left [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Austrian Galicia]] as the territory where Polish patriotic action was most likely to flourish.<ref name=\"Lukowski 203\u2013208\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=203\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Austrian Partition, Polish culture was openly cultivated, and in the Prussian Partition, there were high levels of education and living standards, but the Russian Partition remained of primary importance for the Polish nation and its aspirations. About 15.5 million Polish-speakers lived in the territories most densely populated by Poles: the western part of the Russian Partition, the Prussian Partition and the western Austrian Partition.

All three of the monarchies that had benefited from the partition of Polish territories (Germany, Austria and Russia) were dissolved by the end of the war, and many of their territories were dispersed into new political units. At the start of the war, the Poles found themselves conscripted into the armies of the partitioning powers in a war that was not theirs.  Furthermore, they were frequently forced to fight each other, since the armies of Germany and Austria were allied against Russia. Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary units stationed in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] were turned into the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] in 1914 and as a part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] fought on the Russian front until 1917, when the formation was disbanded.<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Pi\u0142sudski, who refused demands that his men fight under German command, was arrested and imprisoned by the Germans and became a heroic symbol of Polish nationalism.<ref name=\"Lukowski 217\u2013222\">{{Harvnb|Lukowski|Zawadzki|2006|pp=217\u2013222}}.</ref><ref name=\"playground II 279\u2013290\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005b|pp=279\u2013290}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ignacy Paderewski 02.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] was a pianist and a statesman]]\n\nDue to a series of German victories on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the area of [[Congress Poland]] became occupied by the [[Central Powers]] of Germany and Austria;<ref name=\"playground II xxi\"/> Warsaw was captured by the Germans on 5 August 1915.

According to the language criterion of the [[Polish census of 1931]], the Poles constituted 69% of the population, Ukrainians 15%, Jews (defined as speakers of the [[Yiddish]] language) 8.5%, Belarusians 4.7%, Germans 2.2%, Lithuanians 0.25%, Russians 0.25% and Czechs 0.09%, with some geographical areas dominated by a particular minority. In time, the ethnic conflicts intensified, and the Polish state grew less tolerant of the interests of its national minorities. In interwar Poland, compulsory free general education substantially reduced illiteracy rates, but discrimination was practiced in a way that resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of [[Ukrainian language]] schools and official restrictions on Jewish attendance at selected schools in the late 1930s.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\nThe population grew steadily, reaching 35 million in 1939. However, the overall economic situation in the interwar period was one of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. There was little money for investment inside Poland, and few foreigners were interested in investing there.<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> Total industrial production barely increased between 1913 and 1939 (within the area delimited by the 1939 borders), but because of population growth (from 26.3 million in 1919 to 34.8 million in 1939),<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/> the ''per capita'' output actually decreased by 18%.<ref>{{Harvnb|Buszko|1986|p=360}}.</ref>\n\nConditions in the predominant agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, which resulted in rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities. It was firmly repressed by the authorities. According to [[Norman Davies]], the failures of the Sanation regime (combined with the objective economic realities) caused a radicalization of the Polish masses by the end of the 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more repressive regimes of [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"playground 291\u2013321\"/>\n\n===Final Sanation years (1935\u20131939)===\n\n[[File:Sk\u0142adkowski premierem.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A year after Pi\u0142sudski's death, his former personal assistant General [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]] became the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s last prime minister]]\n\nAfter Pi\u0142sudski's death in 1935, Poland was governed until (and initially during) the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of 1939]] by old allies and subordinates known as \"[[Pi\u0142sudski's colonels]]\".

The first male-to-female genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term \"transsexual\" had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.\n\nLili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou developed the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou's work, gender affirmation surgery became available at some academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, a shift in paradigm occurred, with most surgeries performed by private practicing surgeons. These operations are again returning to academic centers in the United States and formal training programs for this type of surgery are under development.\n\n==Medical uses==\nVaginoplasty is the description of the following surgical interventions:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* separation of congenitally fused urethra and vagina<ref name=Hiort2014/>\n* repair of a urethra that is short<ref name=Hiort2014>{{cite book | last = Hiort | first = O | title = Understanding differences and disorders of sex development (DSD) | publisher = Karger | location = Basel | year = 2014 | isbn = 9783318025590|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]]}}</ref><!-- p 104 -->\n* vaginal construction<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ>{{cite web \n| title = 2016 ICD-10-PCS Procedure Code 0UQG0ZZ : Repair Vagina, Open Approach \n| url = http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10PCS/Codes/0/U/Q/G/0UQG0ZZ |publisher=ICD10Data.com\n| accessdate = 2016-03-03 }}</ref>\n* vaginal [[Plastic surgery|reconstruction]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* vaginal vault [[prolapse]]{{sfn|Baggish|page=467-474}}\n* vaginal suspension and fixation<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* operations on [[Recto-uterine pouch|cul-de-sac]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* repair of [[cystocele]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->and [[rectocele]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/>\n* [[retropubic paravaginal repair]]{{sfn|Baggish|page=409-412}}\n* the repair of a cystocele using a [[graft (surgery)|graft]] or [[prosthesis]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* the repair of a cystocele and a rectocele in the same procedure using a graft or prosthethic device<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 --><ref name=icd100UQGOZZ/>\n* the repair of a rectocele using a [[Graft (surgery)|graft]] or [[Surgical mesh|prosthetic material]]<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* the vaginal construction using a graft or [[prosthetic]] material<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 --><ref name = acien/>\n* the vaginal reconstruction using a graft or prosthetic material<ref name=Hoffman2012/><!-- pages 1068-1157 -->\n* the vaginal suspension and stabilization using with graft or prosthetic material\n* treatment of [[MRKH syndrome]] (vaginal agenesis)<ref name = acien/>\n* [[hymenorrhaphy]]\n{{div col end}}\nIn some instances, extra tissue is needed to reconstruct or construct the vagina.

The inverted penile skin uses inferior pedicle skin or abdominal skin for the lining of the neovagina. The skin is cut to form an appropriate-sized flap.

Diet is restricted to ice chips on postoperative day 0, then advanced to clear liquids on postoperative day 1 and later to a regular diet as tolerated. A stool softener is administered for bowel regimen. Activity is initially restricted to bed rest in beach chair position to avoid undue tension on the suture lines or pressure on the grafts until the dressings and drains are removed on postoperative day 2 to 3. After drain removal, activity can be increased to light ambulation. \n\n\nTight vaginal packing and an indwelling bladder catheter remain in place until postoperative day 6 to 7, when they are removed and vaginal dilation is taught. Vaginal dilation is performed using progressively larger rigid dilators three times daily for 12 weeks, then once to twice daily for another 12 weeks. Six months after surgery, patients are encouraged to dilate at least weekly if they are sexually active, or daily if they are not.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Focus area\n!Instructions\n|-\n|Activity\n|Avoid strenuous activity for 6 weeks. Avoid swimming or bike riding for 3 months.\n|-\n|Sitting\n|For the first month post-op, sitting may be uncomfortable, but not unsafe. Recommendation to use donut ring to relieve pressure at surgical site.\n|-\n|Bathing\n|Resume showering following first postoperative visit, patting incisional areas dry. Do not take baths or submerge in water for 8 weeks post-op.\n|-\n|Swelling\n|Labial swelling is normal and will gradually resolve 6-8 weeks postoperatively. Swelling may be aggravated with long-term sitting or standing. For the first week post-op, applying ice on the perineum for 20 minutes every hour can assist in relieving some swelling.\n|-\n|Sexual intercourse\n|You may resume sexual intercourse 3 months after surgery, unless you have been instructed otherwise.\n|-\n|Hygiene\n|Wash hands before and after any contact with the genital area. Shower or wash daily. When washing, wipe from front to back to avoid contamination by bacteria from the anal region. Avoid tight clothing; friction may facilitate bacteria transfer.\n|-\n|Vaginal discharge\n|Vaginal discharge that is brownish yellow should be expected in the first 4-6 weeks postoperatively. Bleeding and spotting should be expected in the first 8 weeks postoperatively. Soap and water douche should help reduce this. Chamomile or lavender liquid soap can help cleanse the neo vagina as well.\n|-\n|Tobacco/smoking\n|Avoid tobacco use or smoking 1 month postoperatively, as this can interfere with the healing process.\n|-\n|Diet/nausea/constipation\n|Begin with a liquid diet and increase to your usual diet as tolerated. Anti-nausea medication may be prescribed. Narcotic pain medication may cause constipation; a stool softener such as Colace can help prevent constipation.\n|-\n|Pain medication\n|Postoperative pain is normal, and pain medication may be prescribed. Pain medication is to be taken as prescribed, and can be switched for Extra Strength Tylenol at any time.\n|-\n|Dilation\n|Dilation is an important part of recovery.

Stop immediately if there is too much resistance or severe pain.\n* Insert the dilator into the full depth of the vagina (until you feel moderate pressure or resistance) and leave in place for 10 minutes. You should be inserting until only one or two white dots remain outside of the vagina.\n* Start dilating three times daily for three months on the day the vaginal packing is removed.\n* You may start using the next size dilator after three months of dilating. You should use the next size for three months.\n* Dilation frequency: 0-3 months after surgery 3 times/day for 10 minutes each time, 3-6 months after surgery 1/day for 10 minutes each time, more than 6 months after surgery 2-3/week for 10 minutes each time, more than 9 months 1-2x/week.\n* If the vagina begins to feel tight, increase the frequency of the dilation schedule.\n* You should use soap and water to cleanse the vaginal canal after each dilation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table 2.

The first male-to-female genital surgeries were performed in the 1930s in Germany. At that time, the term \"transsexual\" had been coined by the sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, who cared for and studied transgender individuals.\n\nLili Elbe, a Danish transgender woman, is historically regarded as one of the first to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Dresden, Germany, in the 1930s. She underwent several surgeries and died from complications related to her final surgery. Wide publicity and attention was brought to the United States in the 1950s when Christine Jorgensen, a former United States Army soldier, was the first American to undergo gender affirmation surgery in Europe.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the French plastic surgeon Dr. Georges Burou developed the modern penile inversion vaginoplasty technique. Modifications of this technique are still commonly used today. Nearly a decade after Dr. Burou's work, gender affirmation surgery became available at some academic centers in the United States, including Johns Hopkins Medical Center and Stanford University. Since the late 1970s and early 1980s, a shift in paradigm occurred, with most surgeries performed by private practicing surgeons.

The inverted penile skin uses inferior pedicle skin or abdominal skin for the lining of the neovagina. The skin is cut to form an appropriate-sized flap.

Diet is restricted to ice chips on postoperative day 0, then advanced to clear liquids on postoperative day 1 and later to a regular diet as tolerated. A stool softener is administered for bowel regimen. Activity is initially restricted to bed rest in beach chair position to avoid undue tension on the suture lines or pressure on the grafts until the dressings and drains are removed on postoperative day 2 to 3. After drain removal, activity can be increased to light ambulation. \n\n\nTight vaginal packing and an indwelling bladder catheter remain in place until postoperative day 6 to 7, when they are removed and vaginal dilation is taught. Vaginal dilation is performed using progressively larger rigid dilators three times daily for 12 weeks, then once to twice daily for another 12 weeks. Six months after surgery, patients are encouraged to dilate at least weekly if they are sexually active, or daily if they are not.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Focus area\n!Instructions\n|-\n|Activity\n|Avoid strenuous activity for 6 weeks. Avoid swimming or bike riding for 3 months.\n|-\n|Sitting\n|For the first month post-op, sitting may be uncomfortable, but not unsafe. Recommendation to use donut ring to relieve pressure at surgical site.\n|-\n|Bathing\n|Resume showering following first postoperative visit, patting incisional areas dry. Do not take baths or submerge in water for 8 weeks post-op.\n|-\n|Swelling\n|Labial swelling is normal and will gradually resolve 6-8 weeks postoperatively. Swelling may be aggravated with long-term sitting or standing. For the first week post-op, applying ice on the perineum for 20 minutes every hour can assist in relieving some swelling.\n|-\n|Sexual intercourse\n|You may resume sexual intercourse 3 months after surgery, unless you have been instructed otherwise.\n|-\n|Hygiene\n|Wash hands before and after any contact with the genital area. Shower or wash daily. When washing, wipe from front to back to avoid contamination by bacteria from the anal region. Avoid tight clothing; friction may facilitate bacteria transfer.\n|-\n|Vaginal discharge\n|Vaginal discharge that is brownish yellow should be expected in the first 4-6 weeks postoperatively. Bleeding and spotting should be expected in the first 8 weeks postoperatively. Soap and water douche should help reduce this. Chamomile or lavender liquid soap can help cleanse the neo vagina as well.\n|-\n|Tobacco/smoking\n|Avoid tobacco use or smoking 1 month postoperatively, as this can interfere with the healing process.\n|-\n|Diet/nausea/constipation\n|Begin with a liquid diet and increase to your usual diet as tolerated. Anti-nausea medication may be prescribed. Narcotic pain medication may cause constipation; a stool softener such as Colace can help prevent constipation.\n|-\n|Pain medication\n|Postoperative pain is normal, and pain medication may be prescribed. Pain medication is to be taken as prescribed, and can be switched for Extra Strength Tylenol at any time.\n|-\n|Dilation\n|Dilation is an important part of recovery.
