Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction). [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.

Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells. From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the bloodstream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s. Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]]. Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by the host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins. The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of the host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium. Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protrusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) that provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]]. Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the bloodstream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells act as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved the killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]]. Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however, the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering the formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system. Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevent the action of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by the host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18). IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection. T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers are associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis. Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective. People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Gassiep 2020\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response. However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear. Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment. [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]].

However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria.

They currently play in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Tre\u0107a HNL - Jug]], the Croatian third division.\n\n==History==\nThe first football club in Zadar was established in 1876 and was named [[:it:Associazione Calcio Dalmazia|AC Dalmazia]]. The club played mostly in Italian leagues until the city annexation to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945.  On April 26, 1945, a new club named ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zadar'' was founded, with departments of football, [[basketball]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]]. On February 9, 1949, the football department was spun off as NK Zadar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724162129/http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |title=History of the club on the official website |archivedate=24 July 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nZadar played in the [[Yugoslav Second League]] on a number of occasions, most recently in 1986.\n\nIn 1992, as ''Zadarkomerc'' the club was a founding member of the [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian First League]]. Since 2001, the club has officially been called NK Zadar.\n\nThe club's greatest success in the [[Croatian Football Cup]] was achieved in season [[1995\u201396 Croatian Football Cup|1995\u201396]], when they lost in the semi-final against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Croatia Zagreb]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa96.html RSSSF.com]</ref>\n\nNK Zadar played in the top tier from 1992 to 1999, from 2001 to 2005, and from 2007 to 2015. Most recently, the club has been experiencing financial difficulties, and after two seasons spent in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Croatian Third League \u2013 South]] (2016\u201317, 2017\u201318), the club was promoted to the [[Croatian Second Football League|Croatian Second League]].

Adriatic coast, best known for playing in the top flight of Croatian football for almost twenty years. They currently play in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Tre\u0107a HNL - Jug]], the Croatian third division.\n\n==History==\nThe first football club in Zadar was established in 1876 and was named [[:it:Associazione Calcio Dalmazia|AC Dalmazia]]. The club played mostly in Italian leagues until the city annexation to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1945.  On April 26, 1945, a new club named ''Fiskulturno dru\u0161tvo Zadar'' was founded, with departments of football, [[basketball]] and [[sport of athletics|athletics]]. On February 9, 1949, the football department was spun off as NK Zadar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724162129/http://www.nkzadar.hr/CMS/0157/Default.aspx?EID=11099 |title=History of the club on the official website |archivedate=24 July 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nZadar played in the [[Yugoslav Second League]] on a number of occasions, most recently in 1986.\n\nIn 1992, as ''Zadarkomerc'' the club was a founding member of the [[Croatian First Football League|Croatian First League]]. Since 2001, the club has officially been called NK Zadar.\n\nThe club's greatest success in the [[Croatian Football Cup]] was achieved in season [[1995\u201396 Croatian Football Cup|1995\u201396]], when they lost in the semi-final against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Croatia Zagreb]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kroa96.html RSSSF.com]</ref>\n\nNK Zadar played in the top tier from 1992 to 1999, from 2001 to 2005, and from 2007 to 2015. Most recently, the club has been experiencing financial difficulties, and after two seasons spent in the [[Croatian Third Football League|Croatian Third League \u2013 South]] (2016\u201317, 2017\u201318), the club was promoted to the [[Croatian Second Football League|Croatian Second League]]. After a mid-table finish in 2018\u201319, Zadar were administratively relegated to the Third League. As of June 2019, the club had hired an attorney to appeal against their relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antenazadar.hr/clanak/2019/06/nk-zadar-angazirao-odvjetnika-i-ulozio-zalbu-na-odluku-hns-a-o-izbacivanju-iz-druge-lige/|title=NK Zadar anga\u017eirao odvjetnika i ulo\u017eio \u017ealbu na odluku HNS-a o izbacivanju iz Druge lige|date=6 June 2019|publisher=Antena Zadar}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nNK Zadar's home stadium is the [[Stadion Stanovi|Stanovi]] with a capacity of 5,500 persons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nkzadar.hr/klub/stadion/|title=Stadion|publisher=NK Zadar}}</ref>\n\n==Supporters==\nThe club's supporters are known as the [[Tornado Zadar]].\n\n==Honours==\n*[[Prva HNL|Prva B HNL]]:\n**Runners-up (1): [[1995\u201396 Prva HNL|1995\u201396]]\n*[[Druga HNL]]:\n**Runners-up (1): [[2006\u201307 Druga HNL|2006\u201307]]\n\n==Current squad==\n{{updated|1 February 2020}}\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=CRO|name=Josip Bender|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=CRO|name=Antonio Repi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=CRO|name=Matteo Prani\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=CRO|name=Ante Sari\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=CRO|name=Josip Ivelji\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=CRO|name=Ivan Toki\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=CRO|name=Karlo Torbarina|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=BIH|name=Tarik Hand\u017ei\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=CRO|name=[[Dragan \u017dupan]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=CRO|name=Josip Maji\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=CRO|name=Jakov Pin\u010di\u0107|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=CRO|name=Mario Pedi\u0161i\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs mid}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=CRO|name=Josip Ani\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=CRO|name=Jure Jerbi\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=BIH|name=Zvonimir Begi\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=CRO|name=Tin Mati\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=CRO|name=Tomislav Reni\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=CRO|name=Kristijan Juri\u0107|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=CRO|name=Ivan Lepinjica|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=CRO|name=Franko Sura\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=26|nat=CRO|name=Josip Jurjevi\u0107|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=27|nat=CRO|name=Vinko Petkovi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=28|nat=CRO|name=Vedran Smokrovi\u0107|pos=FW}}\n{{Fs player|no=99|nat=CRO|name=Vlatko Bla\u017eevi\u0107|pos=GK}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Season\n!colspan=9|League\n!rowspan=2 width=\"30\"|[[Croatian Football Cup|Cup]]\n!colspan=2 width=\"200\"|Top goalscorer\n|-\n!Division\n!width=\"25\"|P\n!width=\"25\"|W\n!width=\"25\"|D\n!width=\"25\"|L\n!width=\"25\"|F\n!width=\"25\"|A\n!width=\"25\"|Pts\n!width=\"40\"|Pos\n!Player\n!Goals\n|-\n|1992\n|[[1992 Croatian First Football League|1.

Colonies on culture medium may grow to several centimetres in height. Older colonies become grey to brown in colour due to the development of spores.\n\n''Mucor'' [[spores]] or sporangiospores can be simple or branched and form apical, globular [[sporangia]] that are supported and elevated by a  column-shaped columella. ''Mucor'' species can be differentiated from moulds of the genera ''[[Absidia]]'', ''[[Rhizomucor]]'', and ''[[Rhizopus]]'' by the shape and insertion of the columella, and the lack of [[stolon]]s and [[rhizoid]]s. Some ''Mucor'' species produce [[chlamydospore]]s. They form mold with irregular non-septate hyphae branching at wide angles (>90\u00b0).\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Mucor mucedo'' (genus species) use asexual reproduction. When erect hyphal sporangiophores are formed. The tip of the sporangiophore swells to form a globose sporangium that contains [[uninucleate]], haploid sporangiospores. An extension of the sporangiophore called the columella protrudes into the sporangium. The sporangium walls are easily ruptured to release the spores, which germinate readily to form a new mycelium on appropriate substrates.\n\nDuring sexual reproduction, compatible strains form short, specialized hyphae called ''gametangia''.  At the point where two complementary gametangia fuse, a thick-walled, spherical zygosporangium develops. The zygosporangium typically contains a single zygospore. Nuclear [[karyogamy]] and [[meiosis]] (sexual recombination) occur within the zygospores, which are thought to be long-lived and resistant to adverse conditions.  They may germinate to form hyphae or a sporangium.  ''Mucor'' includes both [[homothallic]] (self-compatible) and [[heterothallic]] species.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nMost species of 'Mucor' are unable to infect humans and [[endothermic]] animals due to their inability to grow in warm environments close to 37 degrees. Thermotolerant species such as ''[[Mucor indicus]]'' sometimes cause opportunistic, and often rapidly spreading, [[necrotizing]] infections known as [[zygomycosis]].\n\n==Species==\n* ''[[Mucor amphibiorum|M. amphibiorum]]''\n* ''[[Mucor circinelloides|M. circinelloides]]''\n* ''[[Mucor ellipsoideus|M. ellipsoideus]]''\n* ''[[Mucor hiemalis|M. hiemalis]]''\n* [[Mucor hiemalis f. silvaticus|''M. hiemalis'' f.

Born in [[Cambridge]] in 1911, he was largely [[self-educated]], and developed an early interest in books and [[natural history]]. His initial work experience was at a Cambridge bookshop, but he also had a position as an assistant in the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden|university botany department]]. At the age of 29 he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford, who later became his collaborator. He died in London in 2001, survived by his widow and three children.\n\nWhile at the bookshop, he was offered a position as a [[librarian]] at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in London (1933\u20131952). From there he moved to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952\u20131976). After his retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the [[Linnean Society]], of which he became president. He also taught botany at [[Cambridge University]] as a visiting professor (1977\u20131983).\n\nStearn is known for his work in [[taxonomy (biology)|botanical taxonomy]] and [[botanical history]], particularly classical botanical literature, [[botanical illustration]] and for his studies of the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]]. His best known books are his ''Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners'', a popular guide to the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of plants, and his ''Botanical Latin'' for scientists.\n\nStearn received many honours for his work, at home and abroad, and was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1997. Considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time, he is remembered by an essay prize in his name from the [[Society for the History of Natural History]], and a named [[cultivar]] of ''[[Epimedium]]'', one of many [[genera]] he produced [[monographs]] on. He is the [[botanical authority]] for over 400 plants that he named and described.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image | header = Childhood| align = right | direction = vertical | width =  | float = none\n| image1 = Springfield Road, Cambridge.jpg\n| caption1 =  Springfield Road, [[Cambridge]], looking north.

Chesterton was then a village on the north bank of the [[River Cam]], about two miles north of Cambridge's city centre, where Springfield Road ran parallel to [[A1309 road|Milton Road]] to the west.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}} William Stearn's early education was at the nearby Milton Road Junior Council School (''see [[#MJRS|image]]'').{{efn|Opened in 1908, closed in 2006 and demolished in 2007, the site is now occupied by the Cambridge Manor Care Home<ref name=Cambridge2000MiltonRoad/><ref name=GeographMiltonSchool/>}} Despite not having any family background in science (though he recalled that his grandfather was the university rat-catcher){{sfn|Times|2001}} he developed a keen interest in [[natural history]] and books at an early age. He spent his school holidays on his uncle's Suffolk farm, tending cows grazing by the roadside where he would observe the [[wild flowers]] of the [[hedgerows]] and fields.{{sfnm|Heywood|2002|Times|2001|Barker|2001}} Stearn's father died suddenly in 1922 when Stearn was only eleven, leaving his working-class family in financial difficulties as his widow (Stearn's mother) had no pension.{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2001}}\n\nThat year, William Stearn succeeded in obtaining a scholarship to the local [[Cambridge High School for Boys]] on [[Hills Road]], close to the [[Cambridge Botanic Garden]], which he attended for eight years till he was 18.{{sfn|Prance|2014}} The school had an excellent reputation for biology education,{{sfn|Festing|1978}} and while he was there, he was encouraged by Mr Eastwood, a biology teacher who recognised his talents.{{sfn|Barker|2001}} The school also provided him with a thorough education in both [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]].{{sfn|Barker|2001}} He became secretary of the school's Natural History Society, won an essay prize from the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] and spent much of his time at the Botanic Garden.{{efn|He later said \"I was interested as much in birds and insects as in plants but I think it was my interest in gardening which made me choose plants. I gardened at home and knew the botanic garden at Cambridge well.\"{{sfn|Country Life|1996}}}} Stearn also gained horticultural experience by working as a gardener's boy during his school holidays, to supplement the family income.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}}{{sfn|Prance|2001}}\n\nStearn attended evening lectures on [[paleobotany]] given by [[Albert Seward]] ([[Regius Professor of Botany (Cambridge)|chair of botany]] at [[Cambridge University]] 1906\u20131936), and [[Harry Godwin]].{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} Seward was impressed by the young Stearn, giving him access to the [[herbarium]] of the [[Cambridge University Department of Botany|Botany School]] (now Department of Plant Sciences\u2014''see [[#1904image|1904 photograph]]'') and allowing him to work there as a part-time research assistant.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}} Later, Seward also gave Stearn access to the [[Cambridge University Library]] to pursue his research.{{sfn|Prance|2014}}{{sfn|Festing|1978}}\n\n===Later life===\nStearn was largely self-educated and his widowed mother worked hard to support him while at school but could not afford a university education for him, there being no [[grants]] available then.{{sfn|Akeroyd|2006a}} When not at the Botany School, he attended evening classes to develop linguistic and [[bibliographic]] skills.

He continued his research, visiting the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew]], in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris, with the aid of a \u00a315 grant from the [[Royal Society]] to study ''[[Epimedium]]''.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Heywood|2002|Robson|2001}} Also in 1930, the Fifth [[International Botanical Congress]] was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.{{sfn|Festing|1978}}\n\n=== Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society (1933\u20131952) ===\nIn 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the [[Lindley Library]], [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now assistant director at the [[Kew Gardens]], put forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as assistant librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained his appointment at such a young age as being the result of [[World War I]]: \"All the people who should have had those jobs were dead.\"{{sfn|Times|2001}} There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant [[monographs]], such as Bowles' ''Handbook of Crocus''{{sfn|Bowles|1952}} and their work on ''[[Anemone japonica]]'' (''Anemone hupehensis'' var. ''japonica'').{{sfn|Bowles|Stearn|1947}}{{efn|''Anemone hupehensis'' var. ''japonica'' (Thunb.) Bowles & Stearn, now considered a synonym of ''Anemone scabiosa'' H.

In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the society's [[Vincent Square]] headquarters, but the role of the library was somewhat downgraded. [[Frederick Chittenden]] had been appointed as Keeper of the Library (1930\u20131939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related that when he reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}}\n\nLindley was one of Stearn's inspirations, also being a librarian who had a long association with the RHS. Lindley also [[bequeathed]] his herbarium to the Cambridge University Herbarium, where it now forms the Lindley Collection.<ref name=HerbariumLindley/> As Stearn remarked \"I came to know his numerous publications and to admire the industry, tenacity and ability with which he undertook successfully so many different things\".{{sfn|Stearn|1992|p=vii}} Later Stearn would publish a major work on Lindley's life and work.{{sfn|Stearn|1999a}} Lindley's contributions to horticultural taxonomy were matched only by those of Stearn himself.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn soon set about using his antiquarian knowledge to reorganise the library, forming a pre-Linnean section.{{sfn|Barker|2001}} Not long after his arrival the library acquired one of its largest collections, the [[Reginald Cory]] Bequest (1934),{{sfn|Elliott|1999}}{{sfn|Elliott|2009|pp=7, 9}} which Stearn set about cataloguing on its arrival two years later, resulting in at least fifteen publications.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Walters|2001}}\n\nWhile at the library he continued his self-education through evening classes, learning Swedish, and travelling widely. Stearn used his three-week annual leaves in the pre-war years to visit other European botanical libraries, botanic gardens, museums, herbaria and collections, as well as collecting plants, with special emphasis on ''[[Epimedium]]'' and ''[[Allium]]''.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}} His travels took him to Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Sweden.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Walters|2001}}\n\n==== War years (1941\u20131946) ====\nThe only break from this employment was the [[World War II|war years]] 1941\u20131946, leaving his assistant Ms. Cardew as acting librarian.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} Initially Stearn served as an [[air raid warden]], before [[enlisting]]. As a [[conscientious objector]], he could not serve in a [[combatant]] role, but was accepted into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Medical Services|Medical Services]], as he had previously worked with the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]]. He served in the RAF in both England, and Asia (India and Burma, where he worked in [[military intelligence|intelligence]], and was awarded the [[Burma Star]]).

He had now achieved his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants.{{sfn|Barker|2001}} During this time the museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the [[Dicotyledons]] in the [[Bentham & Hooker system]], i.e., [[Monochlamydae]]){{efn|The system by which the herbarium was arranged when the museum's collections were moved from [[Bloomsbury]] to [[Kensington]] in 1881}} and [[floristic]] treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the museum's ''Flora of Jamaica''{{sfn|Fawcett|Rendle|1910\u20131939}} and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war.{{sfn|Hara et al.|1978\u20131982}}{{sfn|Robson|2001}} Seven volumes of the ''Flora of Jamaica'' had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of [[field work]] in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir [[Hans Sloane]] (1660\u20131753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum.{{sfn|Barker|2001}}<ref name=FrodinJamaica/> Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on ''Allium'',{{sfn|Stearn|1978}} ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]''.{{sfn|Times|2001}} He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States,{{sfn|Barker|2001}} and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.{{sfn|Humphries|2002}}\n\nWhile at the museum, Stearn became increasingly involved in the work of the [[Linnean Society]] during his Kensington years.

''Botanical Latin'' (four editions 1966\u20131992),{{sfn|Stearn|1992}} is his best known work,{{sfn|Walters|2001}}{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant [[taxonomists]] and a [[philological]] masterwork.{{sfn|Times|2001}} It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a \"do-it-yourself Latin kit\" for taxonomists.{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} Later, the work evolved into an [[etymological]] dictionary,{{sfnm|Walters|2001|Walters|1992b|Iltis|2001}} but then Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he could have written this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names.{{sfn|Barker|2001}}{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the [[lingua franca]] of botany.{{sfn|Times|2001}} In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his ''Five Brethren of the Rose'' (1965).{{sfn|Stearn|1965a}}\n\nHis best known popular work is his ''Dictionary of Plant Names'', which found its way into the libraries of most horticulturalists.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Stearn|2002}} One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the [[Caribbean]], where he carried out [[field work]].{{sfn|Prance|2001}} Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany.{{sfn|Prance|2014}} William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including ''Botanical Latin''<ref name=Botlatfm/> and ''Dictionary of Plant Names'' and translating German botanical history into English.{{sfn|Baumann|1993}} Just before his death he completed a revision of his original ''Epimedium'' monograph.{{sfn|Stearn|2002}}{{sfn|Mathew|2002}}\n\n====Botanical history====\n[[File:Makers of British botany, Plate 14 (John Lindley).png|thumb|upright|[[John Lindley]], {{circa|1865|lk=on}}|alt=Portrait of John Lindley c. 1865]]\nWilliam Stearn wrote extensively on the history of botany and horticulture,{{sfn|Stearn|1986}}{{sfn|Stearn|1965}} from [[Ancient Greece]] to his own times.

Between 1953 and 1994 he produced more than 20 works describing Linnaeus' life and work.{{sfn|Nelson|Desmond|2002}}{{sfn|Stearn|1959}}{{sfn|Stearn|1958}}\n\nOf Stearn's writings on Linnaeus, the most well known is his edition of the 1753 ''[[Species plantarum]]'', published in [[facsimile]] by the [[Ray Society]] in 1957,{{sfn|Ray Society|2017}} for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753}}<ref name=RayLinnaeus/>{{efn|Volume 1 (1957) ''An introduction to the Species plantarum and cognate botanical works of Carl Linnaeus'', pp.&nbsp;1\u2013176. Volume 2 (1959) ''An appendix to the Species plantarum of Carl Linnaeus'', pp.&nbsp;1\u2013147 includes notes on the illustrations by Stearn with an index to species and genera{{sfn|Desmond|2002}}}} Concerned that Linnaeus' methods were imperfectly understood by his contemporaries, Stearn wrote that his introduction \"provided concisely all the information about his [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' life, herbaria, publications, methodology etc. which a botanical taxonomist needs to know\". ''The Times'' stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what is considered one of the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently, Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'',{{sfn|Linnaeus|1754}} ''[[Mantissa plantarum altera|Mantissa plantarum]]''{{sfn|Linnaeus|1767\u20131771}} and ''{{vanchor|Flora Anglica}}''.{{sfn|Desmond|2002}}{{efn|In 1973 Stearn produced an edited work for the Ray Society dealing with the flora of the British Isles.<ref name=RayLinnaeusGrufberg/> This consisted of two works, the posthumous third edition of John Ray's ''Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum'' (1724),{{sfn|Ray|1724}} together with Linnaeus' ''Flora Anglica'' (1754){{sfn|Linnaeus|Grufberg|1754}} which was based on the former work{{sfn|Stearn|1973a}}}} Later, he would produce a [[anniversary|bicentenary]] guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society.{{sfn|Prance|2014}}{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2001}}{{sfn|Stearn|Bridson|1978}}\n\nAlthough Stearn spent much of his life studying and writing about Linnaeus, he did not admire the man's character, describing him as mean\u2014\"a jealous egoist, with a driving ambition\". When asked which botanists in history he did admire, he cited [[John Lindley]], [[Carolus Clusius]] (1526\u20131609) and [[Olof Swartz]] (1760\u20131818).{{sfn|Barker|2001}}\n\n====Botanical taxonomy====\nStearn made major contributions to [[plant taxonomy]] and its history.{{sfn|Stearn|1973}} In 1950 the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] was held in Stockholm, and the RHS would have been represented by Chittenden, but he had been taken ill. Bowles then arranged for Stearn and Gilmour to represent the society in his stead.{{sfn|Akeroyd|2006a}}{{efn|Stearn later provided a detailed account of this in an address to the International Horticultural Congress in 1986{{sfn|Stearn|1986}}}} The congress appointed a special committee to consider nomenclatural issues related to cultivated plants, which became known as the Committee for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (the \"Stockholm Committee\"), with Stearn as secretary (1950\u20131953).{{sfn|Barker|2001}}{{efn|This committee was chaired by Wendel Holmes Camp (USA), who would also chair the upcoming joint committee of the Botanical and Horticultural Congresses in London in 1951}} Stearn then proposed an [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (the \"Cultivated Code\"), producing the first draft that day. The code was accepted in principle by the committee, conditional on its approval by a parallel committee of the [[International Horticultural Congress]] (the Horticultural Nomenclature Committee), which would next meet in London in 1952 (the \"London Committee\").{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} Later that year Stearn was also appointed secretary of the London Committee{{sfn|Stearn|1952a}}{{efn|Stearn succeeded Chittenden in this position, upon the latter's death. The Horticultural Nomenclature Committee was renamed the International Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature and Registration in 1951}} so that he now represented both organisations. The two committees then met jointly on 22\u201324 November 1951 at the RHS building in London to draft a final joint proposal that was published by Stearn as secretary of an editorial committee and adopted by the 13th International Horticultural Congress the following year.{{sfnm|Heywood|2002|Stearn|1953|Stearn|1952b}}\n\nThe resulting code was formulated as a supplement to the existing [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]].{{sfn|Stearn|1952}}{{sfn|Wyman|1956|p=65}}{{efn|In 1952 Stearn described the history of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature from 1864{{sfn|Stearn|1952a}}}} Stearn introduced two important concepts, the terms \"[[cultivar]]\" and \"[[Grex (horticulture)|grex]]\". Cultivar, a term first proposed by [[L. H. Bailey]] in 1923,{{sfn|Bailey|1923|loc=vol.&nbsp;I pp.&nbsp;116ff}} refers to a distinctive genus or species variety raised or maintained in cultivation, such as ''[[Euphorbia|Euphorbia dulcis]]'' \"Chameleon\". Grex (Latin for \"[[flock (birds)|flock]]\" or \"[[herd]]\") refers to a group of hybrids of common parentage, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' Pink Perfection Group.{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} These concepts contributed a similar clarity to the nomenclature of garden or agricultural plants that Linnaeus had brought to the naming of native plants two centuries earlier.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn continued to play an active part in the International Botanical Congresses over many years, where he was remembered for his rhetorical persuasion on nomenclatural matters.{{sfnm|Heywood|2002|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001}} He was also a pioneer in the application of computer-aided technology to ([[numerical taxonomy]]), as in his work on ''[[Columnea]]'' (1969).{{sfn|Walters|2001}}{{sfn|Stearn|1969}}\n\n====Botanical bibliography====\nMotivated by his interest in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including [[William Herbert (botanist)|William Herbert]]'s work on [[Amaryllidaceae]] (1821, 1837){{sfn|Stearn|1952}}{{sfn|Festing|1978}}{{sfn|Goodwin|Stearn|Townsend|1962}} and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989).{{sfn|Stearn|1989a}} At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} He quickly realised that one of the major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of [[botanical nomenclature]], which gives [[botanical names]] priority based on dates of publication.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation{{sfn|Stearn|1937}} of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of [[Canary Islands]] [[flora]] by [[Philip Barker-Webb|Webb]] and [[Sabin Berthelot|Berthelot]] (1836\u20131850).{{sfn|Webb|Berthelot|1836\u20131850}} Another important work from this period was on [[\u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat|Ventenat]]'s ''Jardin de la Malmaison'' (1803\u20131804), also published in the new ''[[Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History]]''.{{sfnm|Stearn|1939|Ventenat|1803\u20131804}}{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title \"Revised and enlarged by W.

Born in [[Cambridge]] in 1911, he was largely [[self-educated]], and developed an early interest in books and [[natural history]]. His initial work experience was at a Cambridge bookshop, but he also had a position as an assistant in the [[Cambridge University Botanic Garden|university botany department]]. At the age of 29 he married Eldwyth Ruth Alford, who later became his collaborator. He died in London in 2001, survived by his widow and three children.\n\nWhile at the bookshop, he was offered a position as a [[librarian]] at the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in London (1933\u20131952). From there he moved to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] as a scientific officer in the botany department (1952\u20131976). After his retirement, he continued working there, writing, and serving on a number of professional bodies related to his work, including the [[Linnean Society]], of which he became president. He also taught botany at [[Cambridge University]] as a visiting professor (1977\u20131983).\n\nStearn is known for his work in [[taxonomy (biology)|botanical taxonomy]] and [[botanical history]], particularly classical botanical literature, [[botanical illustration]] and for his studies of the Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]]. His best known books are his ''Dictionary of Plant Names for Gardeners'', a popular guide to the [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] of plants, and his ''Botanical Latin'' for scientists.\n\nStearn received many honours for his work, at home and abroad, and was made a [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1997. Considered one of the most eminent British botanists of his time, he is remembered by an essay prize in his name from the [[Society for the History of Natural History]], and a named [[cultivar]] of ''[[Epimedium]]'', one of many [[genera]] he produced [[monographs]] on. He is the [[botanical authority]] for over 400 plants that he named and described.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image | header = Childhood| align = right | direction = vertical | width =  | float = none\n| image1 = Springfield Road, Cambridge.jpg\n| caption1 =  Springfield Road, [[Cambridge]], looking north.

In addition to Professor Seward, those influencing him included the [[morphologist]] [[Agnes Arber]], Humphrey Gilbert-Carter the first [[Director, Cambridge University Botanic Garden|scientific director of the Botanic Garden]], [[John Gilmour (botanist)|John Gilmour]] then curator of the university [[herbarium]] and later director of the Garden (1951\u20131973), the horticulturalist [[Edward Augustus Bowles|E.

He continued his research, visiting the [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew]], in 1930, at the age of 19, and also spent two weeks at the herbarium of the [[Mus\u00e9e National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris, with the aid of a \u00a315 grant from the [[Royal Society]] to study ''[[Epimedium]]''.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Heywood|2002|Robson|2001}} Also in 1930, the Fifth [[International Botanical Congress]] was held at Cambridge, and Stearn was able to attend.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} During this time he commuted between the bookshop, the Botany School, Botanic Garden and home by bicycle, his preferred means of transportation throughout his life.{{sfn|Festing|1978}}\n\n=== Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society (1933\u20131952) ===\nIn 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, who was the Librarian at the [[Lindley Library]], [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now assistant director at the [[Kew Gardens]], put forward Stearn's name, together with Bowles, a vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as assistant librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained his appointment at such a young age as being the result of [[World War I]]: \"All the people who should have had those jobs were dead.\"{{sfn|Times|2001}} There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant [[monographs]], such as Bowles' ''Handbook of Crocus''{{sfn|Bowles|1952}} and their work on ''[[Anemone japonica]]'' (''Anemone hupehensis'' var. ''japonica'').{{sfn|Bowles|Stearn|1947}}{{efn|''Anemone hupehensis'' var. ''japonica'' (Thunb.) Bowles & Stearn, now considered a synonym of ''Anemone scabiosa'' H.

In 1930, the library had been rehoused in a new floor added to the society's [[Vincent Square]] headquarters, but the role of the library was somewhat downgraded. [[Frederick Chittenden]] had been appointed as Keeper of the Library (1930\u20131939), and Hutchinson reported directly to him. Stearn related that when he reported for duty, Hutchinson was completely unaware of the appointment of his new assistant.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}}\n\nLindley was one of Stearn's inspirations, also being a librarian who had a long association with the RHS. Lindley also [[bequeathed]] his herbarium to the Cambridge University Herbarium, where it now forms the Lindley Collection.<ref name=HerbariumLindley/> As Stearn remarked \"I came to know his numerous publications and to admire the industry, tenacity and ability with which he undertook successfully so many different things\".{{sfn|Stearn|1992|p=vii}} Later Stearn would publish a major work on Lindley's life and work.{{sfn|Stearn|1999a}} Lindley's contributions to horticultural taxonomy were matched only by those of Stearn himself.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn soon set about using his antiquarian knowledge to reorganise the library, forming a pre-Linnean section.{{sfn|Barker|2001}} Not long after his arrival the library acquired one of its largest collections, the [[Reginald Cory]] Bequest (1934),{{sfn|Elliott|1999}}{{sfn|Elliott|2009|pp=7, 9}} which Stearn set about cataloguing on its arrival two years later, resulting in at least fifteen publications.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Walters|2001}}\n\nWhile at the library he continued his self-education through evening classes, learning Swedish, and travelling widely. Stearn used his three-week annual leaves in the pre-war years to visit other European botanical libraries, botanic gardens, museums, herbaria and collections, as well as collecting plants, with special emphasis on ''[[Epimedium]]'' and ''[[Allium]]''.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}} His travels took him to Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and Sweden.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Walters|2001}}\n\n==== War years (1941\u20131946) ====\nThe only break from this employment was the [[World War II|war years]] 1941\u20131946, leaving his assistant Ms. Cardew as acting librarian.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} Initially Stearn served as an [[air raid warden]], before [[enlisting]]. As a [[conscientious objector]], he could not serve in a [[combatant]] role, but was accepted into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[RAF Medical Services|Medical Services]], as he had previously worked with the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]]. He served in the RAF in both England, and Asia (India and Burma, where he worked in [[military intelligence|intelligence]], and was awarded the [[Burma Star]]). While there he undertook studies of [[Indo-Malayan]] and [[Sikkim]]-[[Himalaya]]n tropical vegetation,{{sfn|Festing|1978}}  carried out [[botanical explorations]], taught biology to troops and began work on his ''Botanical Latin''.{{efn|\"When I had to sit for hour after hour, day after day, staring at the sky from a Royal Air Force ambulance awaiting planes which, fortunately rarely crashed, I filled in time by extracting the descriptive epithets from a series of Floras lent me by the Lindley Library of the Royal Horticultural Society in the hope of producing some day an etymological dictionary of botanical names\"{{sfn|Stearn|1992|p=vi}}}} His wartime observations led to collaborative publications such as ''An enumeration of the flowering plants of Nepal'' (1978\u20131982),{{sfn|Hara et al.|1978\u20131982}} ''Beautiful Indian Trees'' (2nd ed. 1954),{{sfn|Blatter|Millard|1954}} as well as works on [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] species of ''Allium''.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Heywood|2002|Stearn|1994}} On returning from the war, Stearn and his new wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, were obliged to live in the Lindley Library for a while till they found a more permanent home, due to the acute housing shortage in London.{{sfn|Barker|2001}}{{sfn|Elliott|2002}}\n\n===Natural History Museum (1952\u20131976)===\nFrom the Lindley Library, Stearn (''see [[#1950Image|1950 Photograph]]'') moved to the Botany Department at the [[British Museum of Natural History|Natural History Museum]], [[South Kensington]]{{efn| The Natural History Museum was then still called the British Museum (Natural History)}} in 1952, and by the time he retired in 1976, he was the Senior Principal Scientific Officer there. He had now achieved his aim of becoming a research scientist, despite lack of formal qualifications, enabling him to spend more of his time collecting and studying plants.{{sfn|Barker|2001}} During this time the museum was undergoing steady expansion, with new staff and programmes. At the museum he was put in charge of Section 3 of the General Herbarium (the last third of the [[Dicotyledons]] in the [[Bentham & Hooker system]], i.e., [[Monochlamydae]]){{efn|The system by which the herbarium was arranged when the museum's collections were moved from [[Bloomsbury]] to [[Kensington]] in 1881}} and [[floristic]] treatment of the regions of Europe, Jamaica, the United States, Australia and Nepal, including work on the museum's ''Flora of Jamaica''{{sfn|Fawcett|Rendle|1910\u20131939}} and the Nepal flora he started work on during the war.{{sfn|Hara et al.|1978\u20131982}}{{sfn|Robson|2001}} Seven volumes of the ''Flora of Jamaica'' had appeared prior to the Second World War. Although the project was revived after the war, and Stearn carried out six months of [[field work]] in Jamaica, it never came to fruition; no further volumes appeared. In Jamaica, Stearn followed in the footsteps of Sir [[Hans Sloane]] (1660\u20131753), whose collection had been left to the Natural History Museum.{{sfn|Barker|2001}}<ref name=FrodinJamaica/> Stearn's generic work at the museum concentrated on ''Allium'',{{sfn|Stearn|1978}} ''[[Lilium]]'' and ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]''.{{sfn|Times|2001}} He continued to travel widely, with field work in Europe (particularly Greece), Australia, and the United States,{{sfn|Barker|2001}} and published 200 papers during his twenty-four years at the museum, and although the library was not his responsibility, he spent much time there adding written notes to many of the critical texts.{{sfn|Humphries|2002}}\n\nWhile at the museum, Stearn became increasingly involved in the work of the [[Linnean Society]] during his Kensington years. He was also offered the George A.

It became one of the genera which he was best known, and many [[species]] of which now bear his name.{{sfn|Avent|2010}}{{sfn|Rix|2003}} ''Epimedium'' and the related [[woodland]] [[perennial]] ''[[Vancouveria]]'' ([[Berberidaceae]]) would be the subject of his first [[monograph]] (1938){{sfn|Stearn|1938}}  and were genera to which he would return at the end of his life.{{sfn|Stearn|2002}} At the time the taxonomy of this genus was very confused, and with the help of the Cambridge Herbarium he obtained specimens from all over Europe to produce a comprehensive monograph.{{sfn|Prance|2001}} The work was so thorough that it was mistakenly considered a doctoral thesis by other botanists. He also began a series of contributions to the catalogue of the Herbarium, together with Gilmour and Tutin.{{sfn|Heywood|2002}}\n\n===Later work===\nAfter moving to London, Stearn produced a steady output of publications during his years at the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library (1933\u20131952). These covered a wide range of topics from bibliography to plant nomenclature, taxonomy and garden plants, with a particular emphasis on ''Vinca'', ''Epimedium'' and ''[[Lilium]]''.{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} Within two years of joining the library in 1933, he had produced his first major monograph, ''Lilies'' (1935),{{sfn|Woodcock|Coutts|1935}} in collaboration with [[Drysdale Woodcock]] and John Coutts.{{sfn|Mathew|2002}}{{efn|''Lilies'' was published under Woodcock and Coutts' names but was largely written by Stearn.{{sfn|The Linnean Society|1976|p=300}}{{sfn|Mathew|2002}} The copy in the Lindley Library belonged to Fred Stoker of the RHS Lily Committee, who had reviewed it.

In 1950, [[Frederick Chittenden]], a previous director of RHS [[Wisley Garden|Wisley]] and Keeper of the Library, died leaving unfinished the four volume RHS ''Dictionary of Gardening'' that the society had commissioned from him before the war. The war had interrupted the work as many of the expected contributors were unavailable.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} Stearn, together with [[Patrick Synge]], the RHS Publications Editor, undertook to complete the work, particularly volume IV (R\u2013Z), a task he completed within six months, with 50 new articles. The finished work was published in 1951{{sfn|Huxley et al.|1992}} and not only did he undertake the role of editing this large work but his contributions covered 50 genera, 600 species and complex identification keys such as ''[[Solidago]]'' and ''[[Viola (plant)|Viola]]''.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Since Stearn's entries in volume IV extended from ''[[Soldanella]]'' to ''[[Zygotritonia]]'', he would jest that he was but \"a peculiar authority on plants from 'So-' onwards\". He issued a revised version in 1956 with Synge in which he added a further 86 articles.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Prance|2001}} His recollection of this task was that he acquired \"that occupational hazard of compilers of encyclopaedias\", encyclopedic knowledge.{{sfn|Times|2001}}\n\nMany of Stearn's collaborative works used his bibliographic skills. While his genus monographs largely concentrated on [[Mediterranean]] [[flora]], notably ''Epimedium'',{{sfn|Stearn|2002}} ''Allium''{{sfn|Stearn|1944}}{{sfn|Stearn|1981a}} and ''[[Peony|Paeonia]]'',{{sfn|Stearn|Davis|1984}} he was also the author of species articles both popular and technical as well as a number of classical treatises.{{sfn|Iltis|2001}} In addition he produced [[floristic]] treatments of a number of regions such as Jamaica{{sfn|Stearn|1959}} and [[Nepal]].{{sfn|Hara et al.|1978\u20131982}} He also contributed to many national [[flora (publication)|Florae]] as diverse as [[Bhutan]]{{sfn|Stearn|1994}} and Greece,{{sfn|Stearn|Landstr\u00f6m|1991}} as well as major regional florae including the ''[[Flora Europaea]]''{{sfnm|Stearn|1964|Stearn|1972|Stearn|1980}} and ''European Garden Flora''.{{sfnm|1a1=Stearn|1a2=Campbell|1y=1986|2a1=Stearn|2y=1989|3a1=Stearn|3y=1995}}\n\nWhile his output covered a wide range of topics, he is best known for his contributions to [[botanical history]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], botanical bibliography, and botanical illustration. ''Botanical Latin'' (four editions 1966\u20131992),{{sfn|Stearn|1992}} is his best known work,{{sfn|Walters|2001}}{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant [[taxonomists]] and a [[philological]] masterwork.{{sfn|Times|2001}} It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a \"do-it-yourself Latin kit\" for taxonomists.{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} Later, the work evolved into an [[etymological]] dictionary,{{sfnm|Walters|2001|Walters|1992b|Iltis|2001}} but then Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he could have written this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names.{{sfn|Barker|2001}}{{sfn|Desmond|2002}} The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the [[lingua franca]] of botany.{{sfn|Times|2001}} In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his ''Five Brethren of the Rose'' (1965).{{sfn|Stearn|1965a}}\n\nHis best known popular work is his ''Dictionary of Plant Names'', which found its way into the libraries of most horticulturalists.{{sfnm|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001|Stearn|2002}} One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the [[Caribbean]], where he carried out [[field work]].{{sfn|Prance|2001}} Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany.{{sfn|Prance|2014}} William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including ''Botanical Latin''<ref name=Botlatfm/> and ''Dictionary of Plant Names'' and translating German botanical history into English.{{sfn|Baumann|1993}} Just before his death he completed a revision of his original ''Epimedium'' monograph.{{sfn|Stearn|2002}}{{sfn|Mathew|2002}}\n\n====Botanical history====\n[[File:Makers of British botany, Plate 14 (John Lindley).png|thumb|upright|[[John Lindley]], {{circa|1865|lk=on}}|alt=Portrait of John Lindley c. 1865]]\nWilliam Stearn wrote extensively on the history of botany and horticulture,{{sfn|Stearn|1986}}{{sfn|Stearn|1965}} from [[Ancient Greece]] to his own times.

Between 1953 and 1994 he produced more than 20 works describing Linnaeus' life and work.{{sfn|Nelson|Desmond|2002}}{{sfn|Stearn|1959}}{{sfn|Stearn|1958}}\n\nOf Stearn's writings on Linnaeus, the most well known is his edition of the 1753 ''[[Species plantarum]]'', published in [[facsimile]] by the [[Ray Society]] in 1957,{{sfn|Ray Society|2017}} for which he wrote both a 176-page introduction and an appendix.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753}}<ref name=RayLinnaeus/>{{efn|Volume 1 (1957) ''An introduction to the Species plantarum and cognate botanical works of Carl Linnaeus'', pp.&nbsp;1\u2013176.

''The Times'' stated that no other botanist possessed the historical knowledge and linguistic skills to write, what is considered one of the classic studies of the Swedish naturalist and a highpoint of 20th century botanical scholarship. Subsequently, Stearn became a recognised authority on Linnaeus.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn produced similar introductions to a number of other editions of Linnaeus' works, including ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'',{{sfn|Linnaeus|1754}} ''[[Mantissa plantarum altera|Mantissa plantarum]]''{{sfn|Linnaeus|1767\u20131771}} and ''{{vanchor|Flora Anglica}}''.{{sfn|Desmond|2002}}{{efn|In 1973 Stearn produced an edited work for the Ray Society dealing with the flora of the British Isles.<ref name=RayLinnaeusGrufberg/> This consisted of two works, the posthumous third edition of John Ray's ''Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum'' (1724),{{sfn|Ray|1724}} together with Linnaeus' ''Flora Anglica'' (1754){{sfn|Linnaeus|Grufberg|1754}} which was based on the former work{{sfn|Stearn|1973a}}}} Later, he would produce a [[anniversary|bicentenary]] guide to Linnaeus (1978) for the Linnean Society.{{sfn|Prance|2014}}{{sfn|Daily Telegraph|2001}}{{sfn|Stearn|Bridson|1978}}\n\nAlthough Stearn spent much of his life studying and writing about Linnaeus, he did not admire the man's character, describing him as mean\u2014\"a jealous egoist, with a driving ambition\". When asked which botanists in history he did admire, he cited [[John Lindley]], [[Carolus Clusius]] (1526\u20131609) and [[Olof Swartz]] (1760\u20131818).{{sfn|Barker|2001}}\n\n====Botanical taxonomy====\nStearn made major contributions to [[plant taxonomy]] and its history.{{sfn|Stearn|1973}} In 1950 the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] was held in Stockholm, and the RHS would have been represented by Chittenden, but he had been taken ill. Bowles then arranged for Stearn and Gilmour to represent the society in his stead.{{sfn|Akeroyd|2006a}}{{efn|Stearn later provided a detailed account of this in an address to the International Horticultural Congress in 1986{{sfn|Stearn|1986}}}} The congress appointed a special committee to consider nomenclatural issues related to cultivated plants, which became known as the Committee for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants (the \"Stockholm Committee\"), with Stearn as secretary (1950\u20131953).{{sfn|Barker|2001}}{{efn|This committee was chaired by Wendel Holmes Camp (USA), who would also chair the upcoming joint committee of the Botanical and Horticultural Congresses in London in 1951}} Stearn then proposed an [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]] (the \"Cultivated Code\"), producing the first draft that day. The code was accepted in principle by the committee, conditional on its approval by a parallel committee of the [[International Horticultural Congress]] (the Horticultural Nomenclature Committee), which would next meet in London in 1952 (the \"London Committee\").{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} Later that year Stearn was also appointed secretary of the London Committee{{sfn|Stearn|1952a}}{{efn|Stearn succeeded Chittenden in this position, upon the latter's death. The Horticultural Nomenclature Committee was renamed the International Committee on Horticultural Nomenclature and Registration in 1951}} so that he now represented both organisations. The two committees then met jointly on 22\u201324 November 1951 at the RHS building in London to draft a final joint proposal that was published by Stearn as secretary of an editorial committee and adopted by the 13th International Horticultural Congress the following year.{{sfnm|Heywood|2002|Stearn|1953|Stearn|1952b}}\n\nThe resulting code was formulated as a supplement to the existing [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]].{{sfn|Stearn|1952}}{{sfn|Wyman|1956|p=65}}{{efn|In 1952 Stearn described the history of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature from 1864{{sfn|Stearn|1952a}}}} Stearn introduced two important concepts, the terms \"[[cultivar]]\" and \"[[Grex (horticulture)|grex]]\". Cultivar, a term first proposed by [[L. H. Bailey]] in 1923,{{sfn|Bailey|1923|loc=vol.&nbsp;I pp.&nbsp;116ff}} refers to a distinctive genus or species variety raised or maintained in cultivation, such as ''[[Euphorbia|Euphorbia dulcis]]'' \"Chameleon\". Grex (Latin for \"[[flock (birds)|flock]]\" or \"[[herd]]\") refers to a group of hybrids of common parentage, such as ''[[Lilium]]'' Pink Perfection Group.{{sfn|Stearn|1986}} These concepts contributed a similar clarity to the nomenclature of garden or agricultural plants that Linnaeus had brought to the naming of native plants two centuries earlier.{{sfn|Times|2001}} Stearn continued to play an active part in the International Botanical Congresses over many years, where he was remembered for his rhetorical persuasion on nomenclatural matters.{{sfnm|Heywood|2002|Prance|2014|Daily Telegraph|2001}} He was also a pioneer in the application of computer-aided technology to ([[numerical taxonomy]]), as in his work on ''[[Columnea]]'' (1969).{{sfn|Walters|2001}}{{sfn|Stearn|1969}}\n\n====Botanical bibliography====\nMotivated by his interest in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including [[William Herbert (botanist)|William Herbert]]'s work on [[Amaryllidaceae]] (1821, 1837){{sfn|Stearn|1952}}{{sfn|Festing|1978}}{{sfn|Goodwin|Stearn|Townsend|1962}} and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989).{{sfn|Stearn|1989a}} At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} He quickly realised that one of the major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of [[botanical nomenclature]], which gives [[botanical names]] priority based on dates of publication.{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation{{sfn|Stearn|1937}} of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of [[Canary Islands]] [[flora]] by [[Philip Barker-Webb|Webb]] and [[Sabin Berthelot|Berthelot]] (1836\u20131850).{{sfn|Webb|Berthelot|1836\u20131850}} Another important work from this period was on [[\u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat|Ventenat]]'s ''Jardin de la Malmaison'' (1803\u20131804), also published in the new ''[[Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History]]''.{{sfnm|Stearn|1939|Ventenat|1803\u20131804}}{{sfn|Elliott|2002}} In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title \"Revised and enlarged by W.
