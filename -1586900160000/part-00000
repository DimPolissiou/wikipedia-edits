The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\". Their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", and \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\". The band currently consists of lead vocalist/guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist [[Dale Stewart]], drummer John Humphrey and guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Seether has undergone several changes since their formation in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist/vocalist Dale Stewart, being the only constant members while John Humphrey has been their longtime drummer since joining the band in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in [[South Africa]] in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">[https://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004) ===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''.

Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced in June 15, 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 Jul 2006 |accessdate=15 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts.

The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of October 23.

Do NOT change to \"is\" Addl NOTE: only in Afrikaans; though traditional English is a minority language, it still is based on UK English--> a South African [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1999 in [[Pretoria]], [[Gauteng]]. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\", and their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", and \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\". The band currently consists of lead vocalist/guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist [[Dale Stewart]], drummer John Humphrey and guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Seether has undergone several changes since their formation in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist/vocalist Dale Stewart, being the only constant members while John Humphrey has been their longtime drummer since joining the band in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in [[South Africa]] in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">[https://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004) ===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks.\n\n===''Karma and Effect'' (2005\u20132006)===\nSeether's follow-up album, ''[[Karma and Effect]]'', was released in May 2005. Originally titled ''Catering to Cowards'', the name was changed at the record label's demand.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |title=Seether : Seether Frontman Shaun Morgan Is Very Angry |publisher=VH1.com |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901033029/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |archivedate=1 September 2009 }}</ref> ''Karma and Effect'' debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Truth (Seether song)|Truth]]\", and \"[[The Gift (Seether song)|The Gift]]\". \"Remedy\" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit.\n\nSeether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled ''[[One Cold Night]]'', recorded at the Grape Street Club in [[Philadelphia]], on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced in June 15, 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 Jul 2006 |accessdate=15 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of October 23. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category \"Best Rock: English\", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for \"Best Alternative Artist\".\n\nA tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008.

According to Suraiya, he first thought of Dubyaman as a kind of a superman type hero who would signify the military might and muscle of America, but unfortunately has the brain of a George W. Bush, thereby making him more dangerous. The idea was to show that far from being some sort of a superpatriot, this man could be a potential danger not just to his supposed enemies, but also to his friends and to his own country's people.

It is loosely based on US President [[George W. Bush]]. According to Suraiya, he first thought of Dubyaman as a kind of a superman type hero who would signify the military might and muscle of America, but unfortunately has the brain of a George W. Bush, thereby making him more dangerous. The idea was to show that far from being some sort of a superpatriot, this man could be a potential danger not just to his supposed enemies, but also to his friends and to his own country's people. Slowly but steadily Dubyaman has acquired local flavour with Jug frequently making fun of Indian politicians.\n\nHe became the first Asian to win the [[Pacific Asia Travel Association]] gold award in 1983,<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.ndtv.com/ent/booksreview.asp?arch=1&id=1430&slug=Where+on+Earth+am+I%3F\n|title =  Book Reviews\n|accessdate = 2007-01-02\n|publisher = NDTV}}</ref> for travel writing.\n\n==Anthologies of his humorous writings==\n* Delhi Belly and other misadventures in the middle kingdom (1991)\n* A Taste for the Jugular (1994)\n* The Great Indian Bores (1996)\n* Juggling Act (2005)\n* A Tika for Jung Bahadur (2006)\n\n==Books on travel and non-fiction==\n* The interview and other stories (1971)\n* Homecoming (1977)\n* Rickshaw Ragtime (1993)\n* Word Is a Four-Letter Word: Selected Writings (1994)\n* A Portable India (co authored with Anurag Mathur) (1994)\n* Mind Matters (2003)\n* Where on Earth Am I? \u2013 Confusions of a Travelling Man (2004)\n* Calcutta: A City Remembered (2005)\n\n==Life==\nSuraiya spent a good chunk of his life in Kolkata, where he grew up.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}.

He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture. The [[red wolf]] of the [[southeastern United States]] is a hybrid animal with 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry. In addition, there was found to be 60%:40% wolf to coyote genetics in [[Eastern wolf|Eastern timber wolves]], and 75%:25% in the [[Great Lakes region]] wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nIn more recent times, some male [[Italian wolf|Italian wolves]] originated from dog ancestry, which indicates that female wolves will breed with male dogs in the wild.<ref name=Iacolina2010/> In the [[Caucasus Mountains]], 10% of dogs including [[livestock guardian dog]]s, are first generation hybrids.<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> Although mating between golden jackals and wolves has never been observed, evidence of [[jackal-wolf hybrid]]ization was discovered through mitochondrial DNA analysis of jackals living in the Caucasus Mountains<ref name=Kopaliani2014/> and in Bulgaria.<ref name=Moura2013/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Canis lupus laying.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a reclining North American wolf looking directly at the photographer |A North American wolf]]\nThe wolf is the largest member of the [[Canidae]] family,<ref name=Mech1974/> and is further distinguished from coyotes and jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=129\u2013132}}<ref name=Mech1974/> It is slender and powerfully built with a large, deeply descending [[rib cage]], a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=13}} The ears are relatively small and triangular.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=166}} The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt muzzle.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The skull averages {{convert|230|\u2013|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|130|\u2013|150|mm|in|abbr=on}} in width.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=14}} The teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids.

One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes.

When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves.

Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s.

Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf.

The character as been interpreted as an allegorical [[sexual predator]].{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=64\u201370}} Villainous wolf characters also appear in ''[[The Three Little Pigs]]'' and \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Goats]]\".{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=263}} The hunting of wolves, and their attacks on humans and livestock, feature prominently in [[Russian literature]], and are included in the works of [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Nikolay Nekrasov]], [[Ivan Bunin]], [[Leonid Pavlovich Sabaneyev]], and others. Tolstoy's ''[[War and Peace]]'' and Chekhov's ''Peasants'' both feature scenes in which wolves are hunted with hounds and [[Borzoi]]s.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=21, 123}} The musical ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' involves a wolf being captured for eating a farm duck, but is spared and sent to a zoo.{{sfn|Marvin|2012|p=162}}\n\nWolves are among the central characters of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. His portrayal of wolves has been praised posthumously by wolf biologists for his depiction of them: rather than being villainous or gluttonous, as was common in wolf portrayals at the time of the book's publication, they are shown as living in amiable family groups and drawing on the experience of infirm but experienced elder pack members.<ref name=Kipling/> [[Farley Mowat]]'s largely fictional 1963 memoir ''[[Never Cry Wolf]]'' is widely considered to be the most popular book on wolves, having been adapted into a [[Never Cry Wolf (film)|Hollywood film]] and taught in several schools decades after its publication. Although credited with having changed popular perceptions on wolves by portraying them as loving, cooperative and noble, it has been criticized for its idealization of wolves and its factual inaccuracies.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=294}}<ref name=Jones/><ref name=\"Nevercrywolf\"/> [[L\u00fc Jiamin]]'s 2004 semi-autobiographical novel ''[[Wolf Totem]]'' uses wolves as symbols of freedom and independence. He associates the Mongolian nomads with wolves and compares the Han Chinese of the present day to sheep, claiming they accept any leadership. As such, the novel as caused controversy with the [[Chinese Communist Party]].<ref name=\"DS20060321\"/><ref name=\"NYT20051103\"/>\n\n==== In heraldry and emblems ====\n{{Main|Wolves in heraldry}}\n[[File:Pawnee flag.svg|thumb|right|alt=Pawnee Nation tribal flag in red white and blue featuring a stylized wolf and a U.S. flag, a hatchet crossed with a pipe, and eight arrow heads|The Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma tribal flag]]\nThe wolf is a frequent [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[English heraldry]]. It is illustrated as a [[supporter]] on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shields]] of [[Lord Welby]], [[Lord Rendel|Rendel]], and [[Viscount Wolseley]], and can be found on the [[coat of arms]] of Lovett and the vast majority of the [[Wilson (name)|Wilsons]] and Lows. The demi-wolf is a common [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]], appearing in the arms and crests of members of many families, including that of the Wolfes, whose crest depicts a demi-wolf holding a crown in its paws, in reference to the assistance the family gave to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] during the [[Battle of Worcester]]. Wolf heads are common in [[Scottish heraldry]], particularly in the coats of [[Clan Donnachaidh|Clan Robertson]] and [[Clan Skene|Skene]]. The wolf is the most common animal in [[Spanish heraldry]] and is often depicted as carrying a lamb in its mouth, or across its back.<ref name=Heraldry/>\n\nThe wolf is featured on the [[flag]]s of the [[Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation]], the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and the Pawnee.<ref name=NAflags/> The [[Chechen wolf]] has been a symbol of the [[Chechens|Chechen Nation]].<ref name=JaimoukhaWolf/> In modern times, the wolf is widely used as an emblem for military and paramilitary groups. It is the unofficial symbol of the [[spetsnaz]], and serves as the logo of the Turkish [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Gray Wolves]]. During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], several [[Serb paramilitary]] units adopted the wolf as their symbol, including the White Wolves and the [[Wolves of Vu\u010djak]].{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n=== Conflicts ===\nHuman presence appears to stress wolves, as seen by increased cortisol levels in instances such as snowmobiling near their territory.<ref name=Creel/>\n\n==== Wolf predation on livestock ====\n[[File:The Allendale Wolf.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of a dead wolf with \"The Allendale Wolf\" written on the bottom|A 1905 postcard of the [[Hexham wolf]], an escaped captive wolf shot for killing livestock in England]]\nLivestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation. As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression. The historical use of shepherd dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation,<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Coppinger1995 /> especially when confining sheep in the presence of several livestock guardian dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Espuno2004/> Shepherd dogs are sometimes killed by wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\n==== Wolf attacks on humans ====\n{{Main|Wolf attack|List of wolf attacks}}\n[[File:Grenier Saint Martin loup MdlaC.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a wolf snarling at three children entitled ''Country children surprised by a wolf''  by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin|''Country children surprised by a wolf'' (1833) by Fran\u00e7ois Grenier de Saint-Martin]]\nThe fear of wolves has been pervasive in many societies, though humans are not part of the wolf's natural prey.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> How wolves react to humans depends largely on their prior experience with people: wolves lacking any negative experience of humans, or which are food-conditioned, may show little fear of people.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=300\u2013304}} Although wolves may react aggressively when provoked, such attacks are mostly limited to quick bites on extremities, and the attacks are not pressed.<ref name=\"Linnell\"/>\n\nPredatory attacks may be preceded by a long period of [[habituation]], in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men. During the 50 years to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 200 in southern Asia.<ref name=\"Linnell\" />\n\n==== Human hunting of wolves ====\n{{Main|Wolf hunting|Wolf hunting with dogs}}\n{{See also|Wolf hunting#Quarry|l1=Human uses of hunted wolves}}\n[[File:Provedenie meropriyatii po otstrelu vrednyh givotnyh na territorii Kamyshinskogo raiona Volgogradskoi oblasti.jpg|thumb|alt=Two men with guns pose behind nine carcasses of hunted wolves|Carcasses of hunted wolves in [[Volgograd Oblast]], Russia]]\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] stated that wolves are difficult to hunt because of their elusiveness, sharp senses, high endurance, and ability to quickly incapacitate and kill hunting dogs.<ref name=\"Roosevelt\"/> Historic methods included killing of spring-born litters in their dens, [[coursing]] with dogs (usually combinations of [[sighthound]]s, [[Bloodhound]]s and [[Fox Terrier]]s), poisoning with [[strychnine]], and [[trapping]].{{sfn|Lopez|1978|p=108}}{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}}\n\nA popular method of wolf hunting in Russia involves trapping a pack within a small area by encircling it with [[fladry]] poles carrying a human scent. This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s. Although closely related to domestic dogs, wolves do not show the same tractability as dogs in living alongside humans, being generally less responsive to human commands and more likely to act aggressively.

It is the largest [[Neontology|extant]] member of [[Canidae]], males averaging {{convert|40|kg|abbr=on}} and females {{convert|37|kg|abbr=on}}. On average, wolves measure {{convert|105|\u2013|160|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|80|\u2013|85|cm|in|abbr=on}} at shoulder height. The wolf is also distinguished from other ''[[Canis]]'' species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller ''Canis'' species, such as the [[coyote]] and the [[golden jackal]], to produce fertile [[Canid hybrid|hybrid]]s with them. The [[Agouti (coloration)|banded]] fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black. Up to 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of wolf]] have been recognized including the [[Dog|domestic dog]].\n\nOf all members of the [[genus]] ''Canis'', the wolf is most [[Generalist and specialist species|specialized]] for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more [[Sociality|social nature]], and its highly advanced [[Wolf communication|expressive behaviour]]. It travels in [[Nuclear family|nuclear families]] consisting of a [[mated pair]] accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a [[carnivore]] and feeds primarily on large wild [[hooved mammal]]s, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, [[carrion]], and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. [[Pathogen]]s and parasites, notably [[rabies]], may infect wolves.\n\nThe global wolf population was estimated to be 300,000 in 2003 and is considered to be of [[Least-concern species|Least Concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). Wolves have a long history of interactions with humans, having been despised and hunted in most [[Pastoralism|pastoral]] communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Although the fear of wolves exists in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. [[Wolf attack]]s on humans are rare because wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans because of their experiences with hunters, ranchers, and shepherds.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{See also|Wolf (name)}}\nThe English \"wolf\" stems from the [[Old English]] {{wikt-lang|ang|wulf}}, which is itself thought to be derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|*wulfaz}}. The [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''{{PIE|[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os|w\u013a\u0325k\u02b7os]]}}'' may also be the source of the [[Latin]] word for the animal ''lupus'' (*''{{PIE|l\u00fak\u02b7os}}'').<ref>{{OEtymD|wolf}}</ref><ref name=Lehrman/> The name \"gray wolf\" refers to the grayish colour of the species.<ref name=Goldman/>\n\nSince pre-Christian times, [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Anglo-Saxon]]s took on ''wulf'' as a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]] in their names. Examples include Wulfhere (\"Wolf Army\"), Cynewulf (\"Royal Wolf\"), C\u0113nwulf (\"Bold Wolf\"), Wulfheard (\"Wolf-hard\"), Earnwulf (\"Eagle Wolf\"), Wulfst\u0101n (\"Wolf Stone\") \u00c6\u00f0elwulf (\"Noble Wolf\"), Wolfhroc (\"Wolf-Frock\"), Wolfhetan (\"Wolf Hide\"), Isangrim (\"Gray Mask\"), Scrutolf (\"Garb Wolf\"), Wolfgang (\"Wolf Gait\") and Wolfdregil (\"Wolf Runner\").{{sfn|Marvin|2012|pp=74\u201375}}\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{cladogram|title=Canine phylogeny with ages of divergence\n|caption=Cladogram and divergence of the gray wolf (including the domestic dog) among its closest extant relatives<ref name=Koepfli-2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade| style=font-size:85%;line-height:75%;width:600px;\n|sublabel1=''3.50 [[Million years ago|mya]]''<!--E-->\n|1={{clade\n   |sublabel1=''3.06 mya''<!--F-->\n   |1={{clade\n      |sublabel1=''2.74 mya''<!--G-->\n      |1={{clade\n         |sublabel1=''1.92 mya''<!--H-->\n         |1={{clade\n            |sublabel1=''1.62 mya''<!--I-->\n            |1={{clade\n               |sublabel1=''1.32 mya''<!--J-->\n               |1={{clade\n                  |sublabel1=''1.10 mya''<!--K-->\n                  |1={{clade\n                     |1='''Gray wolf''' [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).png|50 px]]\n                     |2=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).png|50 px]]\n                     }}\n                  |2=[[African golden wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XI).jpg|50 px]]\n                  }}\n               |2=[[Ethiopian wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate VI).png|50 px]]\n               }}\n            |2=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).png|50 px]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Dhole]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLI).png|50 px]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[African wild dog]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XLIV).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   |sublabel2=''2.62 mya''<!--D-->\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[Side-striped jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XIII).png|50 px]]\n      |2=[[Black-backed jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate XII).png|50 px]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]].<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"[[dog]]\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the doglike carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and [[jackal]]s. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata''\u2013its upturning tail\u2013which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{Main|Subspecies of Canis lupus}}\nIn the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the [[mammalogist]] [[W. Chris Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under ''C. lupus'' 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: ''familiaris'' (Linnaeus, 1758) and ''[[dingo]]'' (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included ''hallstromi''\u2013the [[New Guinea singing dog]]\u2013as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 [[mitochondrial DNA]] study as one of the guides in forming his decision, and listed the 38 [[Subspecies of Canis lupus|subspecies of ''C. lupus'']] under the biological [[common name]] of \"wolf\", the [[nominate subspecies]] being the [[Eurasian wolf]] (''C. l. lupus'') based on the [[type specimen]] that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.<ref name=Wozencraft2005/> Studies using [[Paleogenomics|paleogenomic]] techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=Larson2014/> In 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n=== Evolution ===\n{{Main|Evolution of the wolf}}\n{{Further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|alt=Skull of ''Canis etruscus'' |A ''[[Canis etruscus]]'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum]]\nThe [[phylogenetic]] descent of the extant wolf ''C. lupus'' from ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'' through ''[[Canis mosbachensis|C. mosbachensis]]'' is widely accepted.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=239\u2013245}} The earliest fossils of ''C. lupus'' were found in what was once eastern [[Beringia]] at [[Old Crow, Yukon]], Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, [[Fairbanks]], Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the [[Late Pleistocene]]. They had more robust skulls and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]], a pronounced development of the [[temporalis]] muscle, and robust [[premolar]]s. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct [[dire wolf]]. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. Compared with those found in the modern [[spotted hyena]], the frequency and location of tooth fractures found in these wolves indicates that they were habitual bone crackers.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\n[[Genome|Genomic]] studies suggest that modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=Freedman2014/><ref name=Skoglund2015/><ref name=Fan2016/> that existed 20,000 years ago.<ref name=Freedman2014/> Studies in 2017 and 2018 found that the [[Himalayan wolf]] is part of a [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] that is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to other wolves and [[Cladogenesis|split]] from them 691,000\u2013740,000 years ago.<ref name=Werhahn2017/><ref name=Werhahn2018/> Other wolves appear to have originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes that occurred during the close of the Late Pleistocene.<ref name=Werhahn2018/> A study in 2016 indicates that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid [[Adaptive radiation|radiation]] from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.<ref name=Koblmuller2016/>\n\nA 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100\u201312,300 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/> An extinct [[Megafaunal wolf|Late Pleistocene wolf]] may have been the ancestor of the dog,<ref name=Freedman2017/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> with the dog's similarity to the extant wolf being the result of [[genetic admixture]] between the two.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> The dingo, [[Basenji]], [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the [[Mexican wolf]] diverged around 5,400 years ago.<ref name=Fan2016/>\n\n===Admixture with other canids===\n{{Main|Canid hybrid}}\n[[File:F1 wolf-dog hybrids from Wildlife Park Kadzidlowo, Poland.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Photographs of two wolf-dog hybrids standing outdoors on snowy ground|[[Wolfdog|Wolf-dog hybrid]]s in the Wild Animal Park at [[Kadzid\u0142owo]], Poland. The first is the product of a male wolf and a female [[spaniel]], the second from a female wolf and a male [[West Siberian Laika]].]]\n\nIn the distant past, there has been [[gene flow]] between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackal]]s, and gray wolves. The African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically admixed canid of 72% wolf and 28% Ethiopian wolf ancestry. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] shows admixture with Middle Eastern wolves and dogs.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. This indicates that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=Sinding2018/>\n\nThe common ancestor of the coyote and the wolf has admixed with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid. This canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and evolved after the divergence of the [[African hunting dog]] from the other canid species. The basal position of the [[coyote]] compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unidentified canid.<ref name=Gopalakrishnan2018/> Similarly, a museum specimen of a wolf from southern China collected in 1963 showed a genome that was 12\u201314% admixed from this unknown canid.<ref name=Wang2019/> In North America, most coyotes and wolves show varying degrees of past genetic admixture.

Though they mostly avoid areas within human sight, wolves have been known to nest near [[Architecture|domiciles]], paved [[road]]s and [[railway]]s.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=234\u2013238}} During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are less likely to occur.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\nThe [[gestation period]] lasts 62\u201375 days with pups usually being born in the spring months or early summer in very cold places such as on the tundra. Young females give birth to four to five young, and older females from six to eight young and up to 14. Their mortality rate is 60\u201380%.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}} Newborn wolf pups look similar to [[German Shepherd|German Shepherd Dog]] pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=47}} They are born blind and deaf and are covered in short soft grayish-brown fur. They weigh {{convert|300|\u2013|500|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth and begin to see after nine to 12 days. The milk canines erupt after one month. Pups first leave the den after three weeks. At one-and-a-half months of age, they are agile enough to flee from danger. Mother wolves do not leave the den for the first few weeks, relying on the fathers to provide food for them and their young. Pups begin to eat solid food at the age of three to four weeks. They have a fast growth rate during their first four months of life: during this period, a pup's weight can increase nearly 30 times.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=249\u2013254}}{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=46\u201349}} Wolf pups begin play-fighting at the age of three weeks, though unlike young coyotes and foxes, their bites are gentle and controlled. Actual fights to establish hierarchy usually occur at five to eight weeks of age. This is in contrast to young coyotes and foxes, which may begin fighting even before the onset of play behaviour.<ref name=Fox1978/> By autumn, the pups are mature enough to accompany the adults on hunts for large prey.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=42\u201346}}\n\n===Hunting===\nSingle wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs; single wolves have occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and [[muskox]]en unaided.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}}<ref name=Thurber1993/> This contrasts with the commonly held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting to bring down large game.<ref name=Thurber1993/> The size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. The optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nAs well as their physical adaptations for hunting hoofed mammals, wolves possess certain behavioural, cognitive, and psychological adaptations to assist with their hunting lifestyle. Wolves are excellent learners that match or outperform domestic dogs. They can use gaze to focus attention on where other wolves are looking. This is important because wolves do not use vocalization when hunting. In laboratory tests they appear to exhibit insight, foresight, understanding, and the ability to plan. {{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} To survive, wolves must be able to solve two problems\u2014finding a prey animal, then confronting it.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Tracking====\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of a wolf trotting across an arid terrain|An Indian wolf trotting at [[Blackbuck National Park]]]]\n\nWolves move around their territory when hunting, using the same trails for extended periods. After snowfalls, wolves find their old trails and continue using them. These follow the banks of rivers, the shorelines of lakes, through ravines overgrown with shrubs, through plantations, or roads and human paths.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=233}} Wolves are nocturnal predators. During the winter, a pack will commence hunting in the twilight of early evening and will hunt all night, traveling tens of kilometers. Sometimes hunting large prey occurs during the day. During the summer, wolves generally tend to hunt individually, ambushing their prey and rarely giving pursuit.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=240}}\n\nThe wolf usually travels at a loping pace, placing one of its paws directly in front of the other. This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of {{convert|8|\u2013|9|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=32}} On bare paths, a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of {{convert|50|-|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The wolf has a running gait of {{convert|55|-|70|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, can leap {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} horizontally in a single bound, and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes.<ref name=Nowak1983/> A wolf's foot is large and flexible, which allows it to tread on a wide variety of terrain. A wolf's legs are long compared to their body size allowing them to travel up to {{cvt|76|km|mi}} in 12 hours. This adaptation allows wolves to locate prey within hours, but it can take days to find prey that can be killed without great risk. Moose and deer live singly in the summer. Caribou live in herds of thousands which presents dangers for wolves. Elk live in small herds and these are a safer target.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\nWolves carry their heads at the same level as their back, raising it only when alert.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} In one study, wolves detected moose using scent 10 times, vision six times, and once by following tracks in the snow. Their vision is as good as that of humans, and they can smell prey at least {{convert|2.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. One wolf travelled to a herd {{convert|103|km|mi|abbr=on}} away. A human can detect the smell of a forest fire over the same distance if it is downwind. The wolf's sense of smell is at least comparable to that of the domestic dog. Both have a sense of smell at least 10,000 times more sensitive than that of humans.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Pursuit====\n[[File:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of an American bison standing its ground surrounded by six wolves in winter|An [[American bison]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] standing its ground. Bison, elk, and moose will usually stand their ground against a pack of wolves.]]\nWhen hunting large gregarious prey, wolves will try to isolate an individual from its group.<ref name=MacNulty2007/> If successful, a wolf pack can bring down game that will feed it for days, but one error in judgement can lead to serious injury or death. Most large prey have developed defensive adaptations and behaviours. Wolves have been killed while attempting to bring down [[bison]], elk, moose, muskoxen, and even by one of their smallest hoofed prey, the white-tailed deer.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} Although people often believe that wolves can easily overcome any of their prey, their success rate in hunting hoofed prey is usually low.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=7}}\n\nGenerally, bison, elk, and moose will stand their ground, then the wolves must struggle with them to bring them down. Often caribou and deer will flee, but sometimes deer also make a stand. With smaller prey like [[beaver]], geese, and hares, there is no risk to the wolf.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} If the targeted animal stands its ground, wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.{{snf|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=119\u2013121}} Wolves, or even a wolf on its own, will attempt to frighten a herd into panicking and dispersing.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=241\u2013242}}\n\nWhen wolves encounter prey that flees, they give chase. The speed of sprinting prey is closely related to the speed of their main predators. Wolves can run at {{convert|56|-|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} across several kilometers and will often pursue prey for at least {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}. One wolf chased a caribou for {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}}, another chased and tracked a deer for {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and one 11-year-old wolf chased and caught an [[Arctic hare]] after seven minutes. Most wolf prey will try to run to water, where they will either escape or be better placed to attempt to ward off the wolves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}}\n\n====Disablement====\nThe wolf must give chase and gain on its fleeing prey, slow it down by biting through thick hair and hide, and then disable it enough to begin feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=1\u20133}} After chasing and then confronting a large prey animal, the wolf makes use of its {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} fangs and its powerful [[masseter muscle]]s to deliver a [[Bite force quotient|bite force]] of {{convert|28|kg/cm2|lb/in2|abbr=on}}, which is capable of breaking open the skulls of many of its prey animals. The wolf leaps at its quarry and tears at it. One wolf was observed being dragged for dozens of metres attached to the hind leg of a moose; another was seen being dragged over a fallen log while attached to a bull elk's nose.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe most common point of wolf attacks on moose is the upper hind legs.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|pp=28\u201345}}<ref name=Peterson2007/><ref name=Buskirk1978/> Hind leg wounds are inflicted from the rear, midway up the [[Hock (anatomy)|hock]] with the canine teeth. These leave gaping skin perforations over {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Although blood loss, muscle damage, and tendon exposure may occur, there is no evidence of [[hamstringing]]. Attacks also occur on the fleshy nose, the back and sides of the neck, the ears, and the [[perineum]].<ref name=Buskirk1978/> Wolves may wound large prey and then lie around resting for hours before killing it when it is weaker due to blood loss, thereby lessening the risk of injury to themselves.{{sfn|Mech|Smith|MacNulty|2015|p=82\u201389}}\n[[File:Wolves eating deer.jpeg|thumb|right|alt=Photograph of two wolves eating a deer carcass at night|Two wolves feeding on a [[white-tailed deer]] kill]]\nWith medium-sized prey, such as roe deer or [[sheep]], wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the [[carotid artery]], thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute. With small, [[mouse]]like prey, wolves leap in a high arc and immobilize it with their forepaws.<ref name=Zimen/> When prey is vulnerable and abundant, wolves may occasionally [[Surplus killing|surplus kill]]. Such instances are common with domestic animals, but rare with wild prey. In the wild, surplus killing occurs primarily during late winter or spring, when snow is unusually deep (thus impeding the movements of prey){{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=144}} or during the denning period, when den bound wolves require a ready supply of meat.{{sfn|Lopez|1978|pp=54\u201355}} Medium-sized prey are especially vulnerable to surplus killing, as the swift throat-biting method allows wolves to kill one animal quickly and move on to another.<ref name=Zimen/>\n\n====Feeding====\nOnce prey is brought down, wolves begin to feed excitedly, ripping and tugging at the carcass in all directions, and bolting down large chunks of it.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=185}} The breeding pair typically monopolizes food to continue producing pups. When food is scarce, this is done at the expense of other family members, especially non-pups.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=58}} The breeding pair typically eats first. They usually work the hardest at killing prey, and may rest after a long hunt and allow the rest of the family to eat undisturbed. Once the breeding pair has finished eating, the rest of the family tears off pieces of the carcass and transports them to secluded areas where they can eat in peace. Wolves typically commence feeding by consuming the larger internal organs, like the [[heart]], [[liver]], [[lung]]s, and [[stomach]] lining. The [[kidney]]s and [[spleen]] are eaten once they are exposed, followed by the muscles.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=122\u2013125}} A wolf can eat 15\u201319% of its body weight in a single feeding.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=201}}\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Viral and bacterial ===\n[[File:Arctic-Lineage-Canine-Distemper-Virus-as-a-Cause-of-Death-in-Apennine-Wolves-(Canis-lupus)-in-Italy-pone.0082356.s001.ogv|thumb|alt=Footage of a wolf with advanced canine distemper|Footage of a wolf taken from [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo Natural Park]] showing advanced signs of [[canine distemper]]]]\n\n[[Viral disease]]s carried by wolves include: [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[canine parvovirus]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], [[papillomatosis]], and [[canine coronavirus]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}} Wolves are a major host for rabies in Russia, Iran, [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and India.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} In wolves, the [[incubation period]] is eight to 21 days, and results in the host becoming agitated, deserting its pack, and travelling up to {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} a day, thus increasing the risk of infecting other wolves. Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, it has not been recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by [[dehydration]], [[electrolyte imbalance]], and [[Endotoxin|endotoxic]] shock or [[sepsis]], is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups. Wolves may catch infectious canine hepatitis from dogs, though there are no records of wolves dying from it. Papillomatosis has been recorded only once in wolves, and likely does not cause serious illness or death, though it may alter feeding behaviours. The canine coronavirus has been recorded in Alaskan wolves, infections being most prevalent in winter months.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=208\u2013211}}\n\n[[Bacterial diseases]] carried by wolves include: [[brucellosis]], [[Lyme disease]], [[leptospirosis]], [[tularemia]], [[bovine tuberculosis]],{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}} [[listeriosis]] and [[anthrax]].{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Wolves can catch ''[[Brucella suis]]'' from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not to show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, it does not appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause [[fever]], [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], vomiting, [[anemia]], [[hematuria]], [[Jaundice|icterus]], and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from [[lagomorph]] prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have killed two wolf pups in Canada.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Parasitic ===\n[[File:Wild Wolf Afflicted with Mange.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a wolf afflicted with sarcoptuc mange eating at a kill|A wolf in the Yellowstone National Park afflicted with [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\n\nWolves carry [[ectoparasite]]s and [[endoparasite]]s; those in the former [[Soviet Union]] have been recorded to carry at least 50 species.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}} Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} [[Parasitic infection]] in wolves is of particular concern to people. Wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=77\u201385}}\n\nWolves are often infested with a variety of [[arthropod]] exoparasites, including [[flea]]s, [[tick]]s, [[Louse|lice]], and [[mite]]s. The most harmful to wolves, particularly pups, is the mange mite (''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]''),{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} though they rarely develop full-blown [[mange]], unlike foxes.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} Lice, such as ''[[Trichodectes canis]]'', may cause sickness in wolves, but rarely death. Ticks of the genus ''[[Ixodes]]'' can infect wolves with Lyme disease and [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]].{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} The tick ''[[Dermacentor]] pictus'' also infests wolves. Other ectoparasites include [[Mallophaga|chewing lice]], [[Sucking louse|sucking lice]] and the fleas ''[[Pulex irritans]]'' and ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]''.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}}\n\nEndoparasites known to infect wolves include: [[protozoan]]s and [[helminth]]s ([[Trematoda|flukes]], [[tapeworm]]s, [[roundworm]]s and [[thorny-headed worm]]s). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a few have been recorded to infect wolves: ''[[Isospora]]'', ''[[Toxoplasma]]'', ''[[Sarcocystis]]'', ''[[Babesia]]'', and ''[[Giardia]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}} Some wolves carry ''[[Neospora caninum]]'', which can be spread to cattle and is correlated with bovine [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=Dubey2011/> Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is ''[[Alaria (trematode)|Alaria]]'', which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, ''Alaria'' migrates to the wolf's intestine, but does little harm. ''[[Metorchis conjunctus]]'', which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing [[liver disease]], inflammation of the pancreas, and [[emaciation]]. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though ''[[Paragonimus westermani]]'' lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include [[constipation]], toxic and [[allergic reaction]]s, irritation of the [[intestinal mucosa]], and [[malnutrition]]. Infections by the tapeworm ''[[Echinococcus granulosus]]'' in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed ''Echinoccocus'' eggs in their feces onto grazing areas.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\nWolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. ''[[Ancylostoma caninum]]'' attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause [[hyperchromic anemia]], emaciation, [[diarrhea]], and possibly death. ''[[Toxocara canis]]'', a [[hookworm]] known to infect wolf pups in the uterus, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch ''[[Dioctophyma renale]]'' from [[American mink|mink]]s, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}}. ''D. renale'' causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of ''[[Dirofilaria immitis]]'' for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and [[congestive hepatopathy]]. Wolves probably become infected with ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'' by eating infected ungulates. Although ''T. spiralis'' is not known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: ''[[Nicolla skrjabini]]'', ''Macrocantorhynchus catulinus'', and ''[[Moniliformis moniliformis]]''.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|pp=202\u2013208}}\n\n==Status and conservation==\n{{Further|List of gray wolf populations by country}}\nThe global wolf population in 2003 was estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=230}} Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s. This has fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range as a result of legal protection, changes in land use, and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the wolf. Despite these threats, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] classifies the wolf as [[Least Concern]] on its [[IUCN Red List|Red List]] due to its relatively widespread range and stable population.

As well as causing economic losses, the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers, and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programs or state insurance.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=309}} Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves, as they have been bred under constant human protection, and are thus unable to defend themselves very well.{{sfn|Mech|1981|p=173}} Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted. In Eurasia, a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock, while such incidents are rare in North America, where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}\n\nThe majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period, untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=307}} The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep (Europe), [[Reindeer herding|domestic reindeer]] (northern Scandinavia), [[goat]]s (India), [[horse]]s (Mongolia), [[cattle]] and [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]] (North America).{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}} The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species: most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death, while turkeys, sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=306}} Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing, though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures.{{sfn|Graves|2007|p=45}}\n\n==== Conflicts with dogs ====\nA review of the studies on the competitive effects of dogs on [[Sympatry|sympatric]] carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.<ref name=Vanak2014/><ref name=Lescureaux2014 /> Competition would favour the wolf, which is known to kill dogs; however wolves usually live in pairs or in small packs in areas with high human persecution, giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Boitani1983/>\n\nWolves kill dogs on occasion, and some wolf populations rely on dogs as an important food source. In Croatia, wolves kill more dogs than sheep, and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations. Wolves may display unusually bold behaviour when attacking dogs accompanied by people, sometimes ignoring nearby humans. Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests. Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin.{{sfn|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}<ref name=\"Jess\" /> The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are [[Harrier (dog)|Harrier]]s, older animals being most at risk, likely because they are less timid than younger animals, and react to the presence of wolves differently. Large hunting dogs such as [[J\u00e4mthund|Swedish Elkhound]]s are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves.<ref name=\"Jess\" />\n\nAlthough the numbers of dogs killed each year by wolves are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to prey on dogs. In many cultures, there are strong bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses, with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 />\n\nDogs that are employed to guard sheep help to mitigate human\u2013wolf conflicts, and are often proposed as one of the non-lethal tools in the conservation of wolves.<ref name=Lescureaux2014 /><ref name=Shivik2006/> Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive, but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviours, such as barking, social greeting, invitation to play or aggression.

The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June\u2013August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock [[grazing]] or berry and mushroom picking) increase.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in [[Belarus]], [[Kirov Oblast|Kirov]] and [[Irkutsk Oblast|Irkutsk]] oblasts, [[Karelia]] and [[Ukraine]]. Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|pp=164\u2013270}} The majority of victims of predatory wolf attacks are children under the age of 18 and, in the rare cases where adults are killed, the victims are almost always women.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Indian wolves have a history of preying on children, a phenomenon called \"child-lifting\". They may be taken primarily in the summer period in the evening hours, and often within human settlements.<ref name=\"Rajpurohit1999\"/>\n\nCases of rabid wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes. Incidents of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]]. Wolves apparently develop the \"furious\" phase of rabies to a very high degree. This, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals.<ref name=\"Linnell\" /> Bites from rabid wolves are 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs.{{sfn|Heptner|Naumov|1998|p=267}} Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though most cases involve adult men.

This method relies heavily on the wolf's fear of human scents, though it can lose its effectiveness when wolves become accustomed to the odor. Some hunters can lure wolves by imitating their calls. In [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], wolves are traditionally hunted with eagles and falcons, though this practice is declining, as experienced falconers are becoming few in number. Shooting wolves from aircraft is highly effective, due to increased visibility and direct lines of fire.{{sfn|Graves|2007|pp=121\u2013140}} Several types of dog, including the Borzoi and [[Taigan|Kyrgyz Tajgan]], have been specifically bred for wolf hunting.<ref name=Lescureaux2014/>\n\n=== As pets and working animals ===\n{{Main|Wolves as pets and working animals}}\nWolves and [[wolf-dog hybrid]]s are sometimes kept as [[exotic pet]]s.

In 1935, she recorded four sides for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] (\"You Hit The Spot\", \"You Let Me Down,\" \"Don't Mention Love To Me,\" and \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind\"), and another four sides for [[RCA Records|Victor]].  The 4 Brunswick sides are excellent examples of mid-1930s sophisticated New York [[cabaret]] singing. She later recorded for Capitol, Columbia, Decca, and, most importantly, for MGM Records, which issued her only complete album of songs, in 1954. In February 1956, Thompson wrote and recorded the song \"Eloise\" at [[Cadence Records]] with an orchestra conducted by [[Archie Bleyer]]. The song debuted on March 10, 1956, and became a Top 40 hit, selling over 100,000 copies.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Thompson mentored the solo career of the young [[Andy Williams]]. She helped land him a regular singing spot on NBC-TV's new late-night series, ''[[The Tonight Show]],'' hosted by Steve Allen. She got her friend Archie Bleyer to add Williams to the roster of artists on his label [[Cadence Records]] where she wrote many of the songs he recorded, including the 1958 Top 20 hit \"[[Promise Me, Love]]\". In 1963, Thompson paired the Christmas song \"''Holiday Season''\" -a song she had written and first performed in 1945- with the 1942 [[Irving Berlin]] Christmas song [[Happy_Holiday_(song)|Happy Holiday]], and gave it to Williams to sing.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Golden Age of Christmas |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/christmas-mormon-tabernacle-choir/music-2018-concert/golden-age-christmas/ |website=PBS.org |publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc. |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204130151/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/christmas-mormon-tabernacle-choir/music-2018-concert/golden-age-christmas/ |archivedate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Irvin |first1=Sam (Kay Thompson Biographer) |title=Part Three: The Music Compositions: |url=http://www.kaythompsonwebsite.com/kayographies_3_compositions.htm |website=Kaythompsonwebsite.com |publisher=Sam Irvin |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204130030/http://www.kaythompsonwebsite.com/kayographies_3_compositions.htm |archivedate=4 December 2019 |language=English}}</ref> This medley arrangement and recording became a very popular hit, and has since been covered by many artists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allmusic.com search: \"Happy Holiday/Holiday Season\" |url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/happy%20holiday__holiday%20season |website=Allmusic.com |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20191204134413/https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/happy%20holiday__holiday%20season |archivedate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it had been denied for decades, Williams claimed in his 2009 memoir, ''Moon River and Me'' (Viking Press), that he and Thompson had been secret lovers for several years, despite the age gap between them.

She served as an adviser to [[Patti Page]]'s 1957 television series, ''The Big Record.'' {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThompson kept busy with nightclub and television performances, as well as overseeing her successful \"Eloise\" franchise. She returned to live in New York in 1969. Immediately following the death of Judy Garland in 1969, Thompson appeared with goddaughter Liza Minnelli in ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]'' (1970).

Most of her work for MGM has been preserved and released on Rhino/Turner Classic Movies original soundtrack series, including little-known contributions she did for films such as ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944) and ''[[Abbott and Costello in Hollywood]]'' (1945). Her 1930s recordings are available on the CD \"Kay Thompson: Queen of Swing Vocal & Her Rhythm Singers\" (Baldwin Street Records), produced and annotated by Ted Ono.

The 4 Brunswick sides are excellent examples of mid-1930s sophisticated New York [[cabaret]] singing. She later recorded for Capitol, Columbia, Decca, and, most importantly, for MGM Records, which issued her only complete album of songs, in 1954. In February 1956, Thompson wrote and recorded the song \"Eloise\" at [[Cadence Records]] with an orchestra conducted by [[Archie Bleyer]]. The song debuted on March 10, 1956, and became a Top 40 hit, selling over 100,000 copies.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Thompson mentored the solo career of the young [[Andy Williams]]. She helped land him a regular singing spot on NBC-TV's new late-night series, ''[[The Tonight Show]],'' hosted by Steve Allen. She got her friend Archie Bleyer to add Williams to the roster of artists on his label [[Cadence Records]] where she wrote many of the songs he recorded, including the 1958 Top 20 hit \"[[Promise Me, Love]]\". In 1963, Thompson paired the Christmas song \"''Holiday Season''\" -a song she had written and first performed in 1945- with the 1942 [[Irving Berlin]] Christmas song [[Happy_Holiday_(song)|Happy Holiday]], and gave it to Williams to sing.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Golden Age of Christmas |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/christmas-mormon-tabernacle-choir/music-2018-concert/golden-age-christmas/ |website=PBS.org |publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc. |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204130151/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/christmas-mormon-tabernacle-choir/music-2018-concert/golden-age-christmas/ |archivedate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Irvin |first1=Sam (Kay Thompson Biographer) |title=Part Three: The Music Compositions: |url=http://www.kaythompsonwebsite.com/kayographies_3_compositions.htm |website=Kaythompsonwebsite.com |publisher=Sam Irvin |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191204130030/http://www.kaythompsonwebsite.com/kayographies_3_compositions.htm |archivedate=4 December 2019 |language=English}}</ref> This medley arrangement and recording became a very popular hit, and has since been covered by many artists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allmusic.com search: \"Happy Holiday/Holiday Season\" |url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/happy%20holiday__holiday%20season |website=Allmusic.com |accessdate=4 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20191204134413/https://www.allmusic.com/search/all/happy%20holiday__holiday%20season |archivedate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it had been denied for decades, Williams claimed in his 2009 memoir, ''Moon River and Me'' (Viking Press), that he and Thompson had been secret lovers for several years, despite the age gap between them. She later recorded a spoken-word album for [[Signature Records]], ''[[Let's Talk About Russia]],'' which detailed her adventures in Moscow. Signature released a single of two songs by Thompson, \"Dasvidanya\" and \"Moscow Cha Cha\". She served as an adviser to [[Patti Page]]'s 1957 television series, ''The Big Record.'' {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThompson kept busy with nightclub and television performances, as well as overseeing her successful \"Eloise\" franchise. She returned to live in New York in 1969. Immediately following the death of Judy Garland in 1969, Thompson appeared with goddaughter Liza Minnelli in ''[[Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon]]'' (1970). In 1974, Thompson directed a fashion show at the Palace of Versailles, featuring a performance by Minnelli and the collections of [[Halston]], [[Bill Blass]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], and [[Anne Klein]].<ref name=\"biographygenealogy\"/>\n\n==Death==\nThompson eventually moved into Minnelli's [[Upper East Side]] penthouse. On July 2, 1998, she was found unconscious in bed and rushed to Lenox Hill Hospital, where she was officially pronounced dead, aged 88.\n\n==Personal life==\nThompson was married twice:\n* Jack Jenney, trombonist and bandleader, married 1937, divorced 1939\n* [[William Spier]], radio producer, married 1942, divorced 1947\n\n{{cns|date=June 2018|text=After her 2nd marriage failed, Thompson began a secret affair with [[Andy Williams]] (who was half her age) from 1947 to 1961.}} In December 1961 Williams married [[Claudine Longet]].  Thompson moved to Rome and never remarried.\n\n==Legacy==\n*The original soundtrack to ''[[Funny Face]]'' has been remastered and reissued as an expanded 60th anniversary edition, with eight alternate tracks, including four featuring Thompson. Most of her work for MGM has been preserved and released on Rhino/Turner Classic Movies original soundtrack series, including little-known contributions she did for films such as ''[[Meet the People]]'' (1944) and ''[[Abbott and Costello in Hollywood]]'' (1945). Her 1930s recordings are available on the CD \"Kay Thompson: Queen of Swing Vocal & Her Rhythm Singers\" (Baldwin Street Records), produced and annotated by Ted Ono. The rest of her recording career is compiled on the 3-CD box set \"Think Pink! A Kay Thompson Party\" (Sepia Records), produced and annotated by Thompson biographer [[Sam Irvin]].\n* In 2003 Thompson was posthumously inducted into the [[St. Louis Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|title=St. Louis Walk of Fame Inductees|last=St. Louis Walk of Fame|publisher=stlouiswalkoffame.org|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031162946/http://www.stlouiswalkoffame.org/inductees/?view=achievement|archive-date=October 31, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Minnelli recreated Thompson's nightclub act for her 2009 Tony Award-winning Broadway event, ''[[Liza's at the Palace]]''. A CD cast recording, a PBS television special, and a DVD followed. ''[[Liza's at the Palace]]'' opened at New York's Palace theater, an affectionate salute to Thompson, her godmother. Supported by a quartet of singer-dancers standing in for the original Williams Brothers, Minnelli performed songs (with the original vocal arrangements) from Thompson's act, including \"[[Clap Yo' Hands]]\" <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neaSsFwBKk0 \"Kay Thompson & Fred Astaire - Clap Yo' Hands - Song from Funny Face (9 of 10) - YouTube\"]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67BYy_2gVqk \"Liza's At The Palace - Clap Yo' Hands - YouTube\"]</ref> and \"[[Hello, Hello]]\".<ref>[http://kaythompsonwebsite.com/kayographies_3_compositions.htm \"Kay Thompson Website\"]</ref><ref>[http://kaythompsonwebsite.com/Endnotes_05_05_2013.pdf \"kaythompsonwebsite.com\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131339/http://kaythompsonwebsite.com/Endnotes_05_05_2013.pdf |date=August 31, 2017 }}, page 244, 311.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h0dzaYrRrs\"Liza's At The Palace - Hello, Hello - YouTube\"]</ref>\n* There is an exhaustively-researched list of all of Thompson's hundreds of credits for radio, TV, movies, stage, books, and music at the \"Kayographies\" tab at Kay Thompson Website.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010. Web.|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref> The bill had been supported by the pro-Nazi [[Union of Bulgarian National Legions]], the [[Ratniks]], [[Brannik]] (a Bulgarian version of Nazi Germany's [[Hitlerjugend]]), and other right-wing conservative organisations such as the Federation of Reserve Officers, the Federation of Reserve Sergeants and Soldiers, the Merchants' Association, the Students' Union, the Bulgarian Youth League, and the Pharmacists' Association.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was also supported by leading delegate Dimitar Peshev, who later had a role in the rescue.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> On the other hand, the bill was criticised by deputies from the parliamentary opposition (Communists and non-Communists alike) and even former cabinet ministers like Dimo Kazasov, [[Yanko Sakazov]], and Stoyan Kosturkov. The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

The rise of [[Hitler]] saw an increasingly radicalised Bulgaria, as it eventually adopted anti-Semitic legislation, based on the German one. Bulgaria's alliance with Germany during [[World War II]] placed the former into a position of obedience and conformity. In addition, the Bulgarian government was ridden with politicians that held pro-fascist and anti-democratic sentiments. Such was the case of Prime Minister [[Bogdan Filov]], who on 8 October 1940 marginalised the country's [[Jewry]] by introducing the bill culminating in the passage of the [[Law for Protection of the Nation|Law for the Protection of the Nation]] ({{lang-bg|Zakon za Zashtita na Naciyata}}), which entered into force in January 1941 and which restricted the rights and activities of Jews.<ref name=\"auto\" /> Saliently, it forbade the granting of Bulgarian citizenship to Jews.<ref name=\"ragaru\" /> [[Alexander Belev]] had been sent by the interior minister [[Petar Gabrovski]] to Germany in order to study the racial laws; the legislation was modelled on the racial code of Nazi Germany, the [[Nuremberg Laws]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://newpol.org/issue_post/rescue-bulgarias-jews-world-war-ii/|title=\"The Rescue of Bulgaria's Jews in World War II, by Rossen Vassilev.\"|work= Newpol.org. 2010. Web.|accessdate=6 March 2020}}</ref> The bill had been supported by the pro-Nazi [[Union of Bulgarian National Legions]], the [[Ratniks]], [[Brannik]] (a Bulgarian version of Nazi Germany's [[Hitlerjugend]]), and other right-wing conservative organisations such as the Federation of Reserve Officers, the Federation of Reserve Sergeants and Soldiers, the Merchants' Association, the Students' Union, the Bulgarian Youth League, and the Pharmacists' Association.<ref name=\"auto\" /> It was also supported by leading delegate Dimitar Peshev, who later had a role in the rescue.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> On the other hand, the bill was criticised by deputies from the parliamentary opposition (Communists and non-Communists alike) and even former cabinet ministers like Dimo Kazasov, [[Yanko Sakazov]], and Stoyan Kosturkov. The professional associations of Bulgarian lawyers, physicians, craftsmen and the Union of Artists' Societies opposed the law with petitions.<ref name=\"auto\" /> The Holy Synod, governing body of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], was also quite critical, with high clergy such as [[Stefan I of Bulgaria|Archbishop Stefan of Sofia]] and bishops Neofit of Vidin and [[Cyril of Bulgaria|Kyril of Plovdiv]] leading the opposition.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nIn January 1942, Germany outlined what it called the [[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]] at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. This included the creation of camps designed, not to house deportees, but solely to execute them as quickly as possible after they arrived. Shortly thereafter in June 1942, Gabrovski created within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior a Commissariat for the Jewish Affairs, and chose Belev to lead it. The new department began to prepare for the Final Solution. Belev signed a secret agreement with Germany's [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Theodor Dannecker]] on 22 February 1943 to deport 20,000 Jews, starting from the occupied Greek areas of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] and Yugoslav areas of [[Vardar Macedonia]] and [[Morava Valley|Pomoravlje]] first, which had been conquered by Germany but had since 1941 been under occupation by the Bulgarian authorities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe deportation of 11,343 Jews (7,122 from Macedonia and 4,221 from Thrace) was organised and executed by the Bulgarian authorities, with the [[Treblinka extermination camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|Nazi-occupied Poland]] as their final destination.

The passing of the law by Parliament in January 1941 paved the way for the first deportations to take place in November of the same year. \n\nAnti-Jewish propaganda gradually intensified with Bulgaria's rising economic and political dependence on Nazi Germany. This led to the introduction of antisemitic legislation, starting with the Law for Protection of the Nation in 1940. This restricted the civil rights of Jews and was complemented by further laws, such as the establishment of a Commission on Jewish Affairs on 29 August 1942. The commission was tasked with the organisation of the expulsion of Jews and the liquidation of their property. This Act can be interpreted as the immediate precursor of the decision to deport Jews to extermination camps in March 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Fate of the Bulgarian Jews during the Holocaust \u2014 the Menace, the Rescue, the Aliya|first=Rumyana Dimitrova|last=Marinova-Christidi|url=https://shalom.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Holocoust-ENG.pdf|website=shalom.bg}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bulgarian government]] termed the deportations as \"resettlement,\" but Bulgarian citizens were not convinced.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Expressions of dissent grew as Bulgarians protested against any Jews being deported from Bulgarian soil, and the [[Bulgarian government]] was flooded with petitions from organisations of writers and artists, lawyers, and religious leaders, among others.

The forced labour service (''trudova povinnost'') set up by the government of [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] supplied cheap labour for government projects and employment for demobilised soldiers from the [[Bulgaria during World War I|First World War]].

Instead, prosecutions were mainly for \"incidental malfeasance\" and convictions were hard to secure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=140-141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Now fighting with the Soviets against the Nazis, the Bulgarian Army tried to shield from liability officers who had abused Jewish forced labourers and lawyers engaged in the liquidation of Jews' assets mostly escaped sanction.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> Most defendants were acquitted or received lenient penalties and most offenders were never charged.<ref name=\":5\" /> Two death sentences were handed down, including one for Alexander Belev, but he had already died in 1944 and was tried ''in absentia''.<ref name=\":5\" /> Shortly afterwards, records of the ''People's Court Panel VII'' trial were suppressed, including the \"abundant testimony\", and secreted, unpublished, in the exclusive archives of the communist [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]'s Interior Ministry.

State-controlled [[historiography]] attributed the survival to principled and righteous popular action by the Bulgarian people inspired by the then-outlawed Bulgarian Communist Party in 1943. The fate of the Jews of Macedonia and Thrace was \"simply ignored\", by which means \"the narrative cast Bulgaria alongside [[Denmark in World War II|Denmark]] as a nation of rescuers, even exceeding that Scandinavian country in the percentage of Jews saved\".<ref name=\":5\" /> One work to make the comparison was Haim Oliver's ''We Were Saved: How the Jews in Bulgaria Were Kept from the Death Camps'', published in Bulgarian and in English in 1967. Most of Bulgaria's surviving Jews emigrated soon after the war, joining the global ''[[Aliyah]]''. Some Jews who stayed in the country were committed Communists that assisted in spreading the story of the 'rescue' through various media including articles in the state-controlled Sofia Jewish organization's annual volume ''Godishnik'', and a small museum in Sofia.<ref name=\":5\" /> A publication by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1978 was typical - it was entitled: ''The Struggle of the Bulgarian People for the Defence and Salvation of the Jews in Bulgaria during the Second World War''.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the November 1989 fall of Communism in Bulgaria, the fate of Bulgaria's Jews remained \"a cornerstone of national pride\" and \"an unassailable historiographic ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Historiographical debate focused on who should be credited with responsibility for the early 1943 'rescue'. The Tsar, the Church, and the legislators led by Dimitar Peshev all joined the Communists among those to whom responsibility was being apportioned.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn reaction to the view promulgated officially by Communist Bulgarian state, a dissenting view emerged that the Tsar Boris was not an antisemite or a convinced Nazi-sympathizer and should be credited with the Jews' survival.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=141-142|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> [[Binyamin Arditi]], an Israeli politician of Bulgarian Jewish origin and sometime chair of the pre-war Zionist Organization of Bulgaria in Sofia, published ''The Role of King Boris in the Expulsion of Bulgarian Jewry'' in 1952.

The perspective favouring the Tsar was also useful to his son and briefly heir as [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Tsar Simeon II of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]. During his tenure as Prime Minister of Bulgaria under the name Simeon Sakskoburggotsk, a 2003 resolution in the [[United States Congress]] honoured Bulgaria's saving of the Jews.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nBy contrast, in [[Israel]] controversy arose in 2000 over a memorial to Tsar Boris at [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]].

He said: \"when we express justifiable pride at what we have done to save Jews, we do not forget that at the same time there was an anti-Semitic regime in Bulgaria and we do not shirk our responsibility for the fate of more than 11,000 Jews who were deported from Thrace and Macedonia to death camps\".<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/1.5012166 Bulgaria Accepts Blame for Deaths of 11,000 Jews in Shoah] - article in Haaretz, 28 March 2008</ref>\n\nThe role of Dimitar Peshev, recognized as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by Yad Vashem, was emphasized by Italian journalist of Bulgarian Jewish heritage [[Gabriele Nissim]] in his 1998 ''L\u2019uomo che ferm\u00f2 Hitler'' [''\"The Man Who Stopped Hitler''\"]. His petition of 17 March 1943 was inspired by Jewish residents in his constituency, who were ultimately not exterminated on the same timetable as Jews outside the 1940 borders of Bulgaria as planned but were nonetheless deported from Kyustendil for ghettos in the countryside.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Sage|first=Steven F.|date=2017-05-04|title=The Holocaust in Bulgaria: Rescuing History from \u2018Rescue\u2019|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|journal=Dapim: Studies on the Holocaust|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143|doi=10.1080/23256249.2017.1346743|issn=2325-6249|via=}}</ref> [[Tzvetan Todorov]] highlighted Peshev's role in 1999 using excerpts of Peshev's post-war diary in ''La fragilit\u00e9 du bien: le sauvetage des juifs bulgares'' [''\"The Fagility of Good: the Rescue of the Bulgarian Jews\"'']. After the judgement reached in 2000 in Israel on the culpability of Boris III for the massacre of the Macedonian and Thracian Jews, Todorov's book's English translation was released in 2001 with the subtitle's wording changed to ''Why Bulgaria\u2019s Jews Survived the Holocaust''.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nAlso in 1999, Nissim's work ''L\u2019uomo che ferm\u00f2 Hitler'' appeared in Bulgarian translation, published with assistance from the Bulgarian National Assembly.
