She and her husbands [[Ned Lyons]] and Billy Burke were among the most sought-after career criminals in the U.S. and Canada, being wanted in several major cities including New York City [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], Detroit [[Detroit]] and [[Montreal]] from the 1860s until the turn of the 20th century.\n\nShe and Lyons were prominent underworld figures in [[New York City]] during the post-[[American Civil War]] era as associates of [[Marm Mandelbaum]], Lyons being a member of Mandelbaum's \"inner circle\" during the 1860s and 1870s.<ref>[[Herbert Asbury|Asbury, Herbert]].

Her mother, [[Baltimore]] shoplifter Sophie Elkins,<ref>La Fountaine, George. ''The Scott-Dunlap Ring''. New York: Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1978. (pg. 113)</ref> was a \"keeper of a [[disorderly house]]\" on New York's [[East Side (Manhattan)|East Side]], and supposedly forced her out into the street to steal.

During her youth, she became known as a skilled pickpocket and confidence woman.

Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her youngest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother. How can I tell you are when you have two husbands with whom you go all over the country, stealing everywhere?\" These accusations caused a disturbance in the court room and the magistrate called for a [[Recess (break)|recess]] to listen to both mother and son in private.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\nLyons confessed to her criminal past and being the wife of Ned, however she maintained that she had spent considerable time and effort trying to keep her children from becoming criminals. She had sent George to three colleges in Canada, and her two daughters attended schools in Germany,<ref name=\"Houdini\"/> but George returned to New York and began frequenting underworld resorts, including [[Dan Kerrigan]]'s infamous [[6th Street (Manhattan)|Sixth Street]] saloon, where he performed as a singer and associated with known criminals. She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]]. The magistrate ruled that George would be held in custody until the claims of both parties could be investigated. George, being informed that he would not be released, had to be escorted from the court room by police and attempted to choke himself by swallowing a handkerchief.<ref name=\"Article\"/>\n\n===Last days in New York===\nLyons spent much of the 1890s in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] as a member of a burglary gang led by Billy Burke, whom she would later marry.

Lyons, then using the alias Mary Watson, was approached by [[store detective]] Mary Plunkett, who had recognized her, and who informed her she was wanted by local police. When Lyons dismissed her, Plunkett grabbed her arm, attempting to bring her in by force. A crowd began to gather as the argument escalated. Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them. At that point, Lyons got free of Plunkett and left the store with the detective in pursuit. Plunkett pursued Lyons onto a [[streetcar]], where she informed the driver that Lyons was wanted by police. The driver allowed Lyons onto the streetcar, replying to Plunkett that it was none of his business. As they reached [[18th Street (Manhattan)|Eighteenth Street]], Plunkett was able to call two patrolmen and had Lyons placed under arrest.\n\nLyons refused to be taken back to the dry goods store, insisting that she be searched to prove her innocence, but was instead arrested and taken to the [[Mercer Street (Manhattan)|Mercer Street]] police station. She was held at the precinct until her arraignment at the Jefferson Market police court on June 22. She was charged with the theft of a pocketbook from an unknown woman in [[New Jersey]], which contained $12 and a railroad ticket, and it was requested by the court that she be [[Remand (detention)|remanded]]. Her lawyer, Emanuel Friend, successfully argued for her release by pointing out the largely vague circumstances of the charges and the absence of the store detective. The magistrate agreed that the city had no evidence to prosecute Lyons and dismissed her case.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05E6D71338E233A25751C2A9609C94679ED7CF \"Sophie Lyons Again Arrested.; This Time There Was No Evidence Against the Woman\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 22, 1896</ref>\n\n===Retirement and later years===\nFollowing her \"retirement\" from crime in 1913, Lyons eventually settled in Detroit, where she wrote her memoir, ''Why Crime Does Not Pay'', and became a known philanthropist and prison reformer. She also owned 40 houses, not including vacant property, due to real estate and business investments worth $500,000<ref>\"Queen Of Crooks Reforms; Mrs. Lyons-Burke Will Devote Half-Million to Aiding Convicts\". ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 13, 1913</ref> (approximately $12.7 million in 2018). She publicly offered to provide rent-free homes for any criminals with families who were brought to Detroit by the Pathfinders' Club reform group. On February 2, 1916, she announced at the Pathfinders' annual dinner that she would be donating land worth $35,000 to establish a building for juvenile delinquents.\n\nThe Pathfinders' Club operated a similar \"character building\" facility at [[Lafayette Boulevard]] on Twenty-Fourth Street. Lyons specified that the gift was offered on the following condition: \"The home is to be devoted to the work of convincing children who have begun to be criminals that they have chosen the wrong path, and also to training them so that they will have the strength to go alright. A secondary purpose is to provide a place in which adults who have fallen into crime may get a new start in life.\"<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70813F6355C13738DDDAA0894DA405B868DF1D3 \"Sophie Lyons Offers Gift.; Retired Thief Has Site for Criminals Home in Detroit\"]. ''[[The New York Times]], February 3, 1916</ref>\n\nIn July 1922, the 73-year-old Lyons discovered that her house had been robbed of between $6,000{{ndash}}7,000 in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and $13,000 in diamonds. She had returned home after a day trip to [[Put-in-Bay]] to find her house \"ransacked and the floor strewn with empty boxes, books and other articles\". She claimed the diamonds were a gift from her son, who had recently died in [[Seattle]]. She commented to reporters, \"I have no idea who did the 'job,' and I am unhappy to think that men would do such a thing to an old woman who devotes a large income to prison relief work.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17448997/sophie-lyons-detroit-home-robbed/ |title=Rob Ex-Confidence Woman; Burglars Sack Sophie L.

The Scouting was organized among the Slovene ethnic groups in neighboring countries: The Slovene Carinthian Scouts organisation (1957) in [[Austria]] (today part of the [[Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen \u00d6sterreichs]]); the Slovene Scouts of Trieste (Slovenska Zamejska Skavtska Organizacija) (1951 at [[Trieste]]) for boys and in 1958 for girls; and the Slovene Scouts of [[Gorizia]] (SZSO - Slovenski gori\u0161ki skavti) (1963) for girls and 1964 for boys as well.\n\n==ZSKSS establishment==\nIn 1984, a secondary school [[student]] from Ljubljana, '''Peter Lov\u0161in''', became acquainted with the Scout Movement. He decided to begin apolitical Scouting in [[Ljubljana]]. In the summer of 1985 he went to camp with Scouts from [[Gorizia]], and in 1986 he made the Scout Promise as one of their rank. In the same year he gathered a group of young people around him in one of the Catholic [[parish]]es of Ljubljana, with assistance from slovene Scouts from [[Trieste]] and [[Gorizia]]. The group was growing and in autumn 1988 was moved to another parish of Ljubljana. During the [[Saint George]] feast of 1989, 12 boys and girls made the Scout Promise, and by 1990, there were 21 Girl Guides and 18 Boy Scouts. The Catholic Scout Movement began to spread all over [[Slovenia]]. On March 31, 1990, the Zdru\u017eenje slovenskih katoli\u0161kih skavtinj in skavtov (ZSKSS) was established. The first legal Scout Promises were made by 29 Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, in a suburb of Ljubljana on May 20 of that year. Officially the ZSKSS was registered on Sunday, October 22, 1992.\n[[File:WSJ2007 Slovenian Scouts.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Slovene Scouts ([[Zveza tabornikov Slovenije|ZTS]] and ZSKSS) at 21st World Scout Jamboree ]]\n\n==International membership==\nIn 1996 ZSKSS was accepted as an associate member of [[WAGGGS]].
