His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised.

In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She also appeared briefly in ''[[Stardust Memories]]''.\n\nIn 1969, Allen cast [[Diane Keaton]] in his Broadway show ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]].'' During the run she and Allen became romantically involved. Although they broke up after a year, she continued to star in his films, including ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' as a futuristic poet and ''[[Love and Death]]'' as a composite character based on the novels of [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]]. ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was very important in Allen's and Keaton's careers. It is said that the role was written for her, as Keaton's birth name was Diane Hall. She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

He was later hired as a full-time writer for humorist [[Herb Shriner]], initially earning $25 a week.<ref name=\"timemag\" /> He began writing scripts for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen|The Tonight Show]]'', specials for Sid Caesar post-''[[Caesar's Hour]]'' (1954\u20131957), and other television shows.<ref name=\"Lax Bio\" />{{sup|p.111}} By the time he was working for Caesar, he was earning $1,500 a week.

His contemporaries during those years included [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Shelley Berman]], the team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Mort Sahl]], his personal favorite. Comedy historian [[Gerald Nachman (journalist)|Gerald Nachman]] notes that Allen, while not the first to do stand-up, would eventually have greater impact than all the others in the 1960s, and would redefine the meaning of stand-up comedy: \"He helped turn it into biting, brutally honest satirical commentary on the cultural and psychological tenor of the times.\"<ref name=\"Nachman\">{{cite book |last1=Nachman |first1=Gerland |title=Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s |url=https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach |url-access=registration |date=2003 |publisher=Pantheon |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-375-41030-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/seriouslyfunnyre00nach/page/659 659]}}</ref>{{rp|525}}\n\nAfter Allen was taken under the wing of his new manager, [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]], who had recently discovered Nichols and May, Rollins suggested he perform his written jokes as a stand-up. Allen was resistant at first, but after seeing [[Mort Sahl]] on stage, he felt safer to give it a try: \"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}} Allen made his professional stage debut at the Blue Angel nightclub in Manhattan in October 1960, where comedian [[Shelley Berman]] introduced him as a young television writer who would perform his own material.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|545}}\n\nHis early stand-up shows with his different style of humor were not always well received or understood by his audiences. Unlike other comedians, Allen spoke to his audiences in a gentle and conversational style, often appearing to be searching for words, although he was well rehearsed. He acted \"normal\", dressed casually, and made no attempt to project a stage \"personality\". And he did not improvise: \"I put very little premium on improvisation,\" he told [[Studs Terkel]].<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|532}} His jokes were created from life experiences, and typically presented with a dead serious demeanor that made them funnier: \"I don't think my family liked me. They put a live teddy bear in my crib.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|533}}\n\nThe subjects of his jokes were rarely topical, political or socially relevant. Unlike Bruce and Sahl, he did not discuss current events such as civil rights, women's rights, the Cold War, or Vietnam. And although he was described as a \"classic nebbish\", he did not tell Jewish jokes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/stars-of-david-10-jewish-hollywood-icons/|title=Let There Be Laughter \u2013 Jewish Humor Around the World|last=|first=|date=|website=Beit Hatfutsot|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Comedy screenwriter [[Larry Gelbart]] compared Allen's style to [[Elaine May]]: \"He just styled himself completely after her,\" he said.<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|546}} Like [[Nichols and May]], he often made fun of intellectuals.\n\nTelevision talk show host [[Dick Cavett]], who was among the minority who quickly appreciated Allen's unique style, recalls seeing the audience at the Blue Angel mostly ignore Allen's [[monologue]]: \"I recognized immediately that there was no young comedian in the country in the same class with him for sheer brilliance of jokes, and I resented the fact that the audience was too dumb to realize what they were getting.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|550}} It was his subdued stage presence, while initially unappreciated, that eventually became one of Allen's strongest traits, explains Nachman: \"The utter absence of showbiz veneer and shtick was the best shtick any comedian had ever devised. This uneasy onstage naturalness became a trademark.\"<ref name=Nachman />{{rp|530}} When he was finally noticed by the media, writers like ''The New York Times''{{'}}s [[Arthur Gelb]] described Allen's nebbish quality as [[Charlie Chaplin|\"Chaplinesque\"]] and \"refreshing\".\n\nAllen developed an anxious, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up act, a successful move that secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.

Feldman]] production ''[[What's New, Pussycat?]]'' (1965), for which he wrote the screenplay. He was disappointed with the final product, which inspired him to direct every film he wrote thereafter.<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> Allen's first directorial effort was ''[[What's Up, Tiger Lily?]]'' (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie\u2014''[[Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi]]'' (1965), \"International Secret Police: Key of Keys\"\u2014was redubbed in English by Allen and friends with fresh new, comic dialogue. In 1967 Allen played Jimmy Bond in the 007 spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.\n\nIn 1969 Allen directed, starred in, and co-wrote (with Mickey Rose) ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', which received positive reviews. He later signed a deal with [[United Artists]] to produce several films. Those films eventually became ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'' (1971, co-written with Rose), ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (film)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' (1972), ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]'' (1973), and ''[[Love and Death]]'' (1975).<ref name=\"PBSdocumentary\" /> ''Sleeper'' was the first of four screenplays co-written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]].<ref name=\"Liebenson\">{{cite web |last1=Liebenson |first1=Donald |title=The Annie Hall That Might Have Been: Inside Woody Allen's Anhedonia |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/annie-hall-40th-anniversary-woody-allen-carol-kane-marshall-brickman |website=vanityfair.com |accessdate=November 14, 2018 |date=April 20, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"partners\">{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Matt |last2=Johnson|first2=Claudia |title=Script Partners: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV: How to Succeed at Co-Writing for Film & TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LvbdCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|date=March 31, 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-317-41792-7|pages=37\u2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Allen wrote and starred in the film version of ''[[Play It Again, Sam (film)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', directed by [[Herbert Ross]] and co-starring Diane Keaton.

''Annie Hall'' set the standard for modern romantic comedy and ignited a fashion trend with the clothes Keaton wore in the film.

As in many Allen films, the main protagonists are upper-middle class writers and academics. ''Manhattan'' focuses on the complicated relationship between middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and 17-year-old Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), and co-stars Diane Keaton.\n\nKeaton, who has made eight movies with Allen, has said, \"He just has a mind like nobody else.

In 1989 Allen and directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Martin Scorsese]] made ''[[New York Stories]]'', an [[anthology film]] about New Yorkers.

''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of [[Diane Keaton]], [[Alan Alda]] and [[Anjelica Huston]].\n\nHe returned to lighter movies like ''[[Bullets over Broadway]]'' (1994), which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Director, followed by a musical, ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'' (1996). The singing and dancing scenes in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' are similar to musicals starring [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]]. The comedy ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Mira Sorvino]]. Allen's 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' was nominated for two Academy Awards, for [[Sean Penn]] (Best Actor) and [[Samantha Morton]] (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire toward the end of the decade with ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'' (1997) and ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'' (1998).\n\nDuring this decade Allen also starred in the television film ''[[The Sunshine Boys (1996 film)|The Sunshine Boys]]'' (1995), based on the [[Neil Simon]] [[The Sunshine Boys|play of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Greg |title=Review: 'The Sunshine Boys' |url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/reviews/the-sunshine-boys-4-1200452126/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |date=December 21, 1997}}</ref>\n\nAllen made one sitcom \"appearance\" via telephone on the show ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' in a 1997 episode, \"My Dinner with Woody\", that paid tribute to several of his films.

His first great success was ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'', which opened in 1968, and ran for 598 performances for almost two years on Broadway. His success continued with ''[[Play It Again, Sam (play)|Play It Again, Sam]]'', which opened in 1969, starring Allen and [[Diane Keaton]]. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three [[Tony Awards]], although none of the nominations were for Allen's writing or acting.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=2849 |title=Internet Broadway Database: Play It Again, Sam Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb |date=March 14, 1970 |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s Allen wrote a number of one-act plays, most notably ''[[God (play)|God]]'' and ''[[Death (play)|Death]]'', which were published in his 1975 collection ''[[Without Feathers]]''. In 1981 Allen's play ''[[The Floating Light Bulb]]'' opened on Broadway. It was a critical success and a commercial flop. Despite two [[Tony Award]] nominations, a Tony win for the acting of [[Brian Backer]] (who won the 1981 [[Theater World Award]] and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for his work), the play only ran for 62 performances.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4112 |title=Internet Broadway Database: The Floating Light Bulb Production Credits |publisher=Ibdb.com |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}</ref> After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theatre in 1995 with the one-act ''Central Park West'', an installment in an evening of theatre, ''Death Defying Acts'', that also included new work by [[David Mamet]] and [[Elaine May]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |title=Death Defying Acts and No One Shall Be Immune \u2013 David Mamet Society |publisher=Mamet.eserver.org |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224171536/http://mamet.eserver.org/review/1995/death.html |archive-date=February 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the next few years Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, but notable productions of his work were staged.

According to Allen, the newspapers reported that she had been \"violated\".

She then starred in ''[[Interiors]]'' as a poet, followed by ''[[Manhattan]]''. In 1987, she had a cameo as a nightclub singer in ''[[Radio Days]]'', and she was chosen to replace [[Mia Farrow]] in ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]'' after Allen and Farrow began having problems with their relationship.

The \"Goldstein Award\" at the college's annual commencement awards the graduate with the greatest potential for success in public service. All of [[Maryland Route 2]]/[[Maryland Route 4|4]] in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert County]] is named after Goldstein.\n\nThe Calvert County Democratic Party's annual dinner banquet is also named after Louis L. Goldstein. Goldstein deputy, Robert L. \"Bobby\" Swann was appointed Comptroller after Goldstein's death by then-governor [[Parris Glendening]]. Former four-term [[Mayor of Baltimore]] and two-term Governor [[William Donald Schaefer]] later ran for the office of Comptroller in November 1998. Goldstein had already announced he was running for another term before his death and would have almost certainly been re-elected even at age 85.

The \"Goldstein Award\" at the college's annual commencement awards the graduate with the greatest potential for success in public service. All of [[Maryland Route 2]]/[[Maryland Route 4|4]] in [[Calvert County, Maryland|Calvert County]] is named after Goldstein.\n\nThe Calvert County Democratic Party's annual dinner banquet is also named after Louis L. Goldstein. Goldstein deputy, Robert L. \"Bobby\" Swann was appointed Comptroller after Goldstein's death by then-governor [[Parris Glendening]]. Former four-term [[Mayor of Baltimore]] and two-term Governor [[William Donald Schaefer]] later ran for the office of Comptroller in November 1998. Goldstein had already announced he was running for another term before his death and would have almost certainly been re-elected even at age 85. Schaefer, tired of being out of public office, and still popular with a wide support among the electorate, won easily following Goldstein's death.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/001400/001489/html/msa01489.html |title=William Donald Schaefer |publisher=Maryland State Archives |date=April 19, 2011 |access-date=July 2, 2011 }}</ref>\nIronically, Schaefer and Goldstein sat on the Maryland Board of Public Works together when Goldstein was comptroller and Schaefer was governor. The two were not particularly close personally or professionally, although Goldstein was almost always gracious but tough at BPW meetings. Longtime Maryland Senate President Thomas V. (Mike) Miller, Jr., considers Goldstein one of the greatest politicians he has ever known. Goldstein rarely forgot a name or at least a face.\n\nHis Annapolis office was taken apart piece-by-piece after his death at the guidance of his longtime friend and deputy comptroller, Swann, and was replicated at the [[Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum|Jefferson Patterson Park and Museum]] located in [[St. Leonard, Maryland]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jefpat.org/exhibits.html |title=Jefferson Patterson Park & Museum |work=jefpat.org |publisher=Maryland Department of Planning |access-date=July 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n\"God bless y'all real good.\"<ref name=marylandgov />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*[http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/08conoff/former/html/msa01579.html Maryland Archives biography]\n*{{Find a Grave|7508823}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before = [[George Della]] | title = [[President of the Maryland State Senate]] | years = 1955\u20131958 | after = [[George Della]]}}\n{{succession box | before = [[J.
