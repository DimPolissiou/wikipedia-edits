Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).\n\nThe realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.<ref>See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details.

Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 119. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nThe Earth is massive enough that the pull of [[gravity]] maintains its roughly spherical shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the [[centrifugal force]] caused by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an [[oblate ellipsoid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/planets-round/en/|title=Why Are Planets Round? {{!}} NASA Space Place \u2013 NASA Science for Kids|website=spaceplace.nasa.gov|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Formation===\n{{further|History of Earth|Equatorial bulge}}\n\nThe [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.\n\nA sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.\n\nThe liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].\n\n===Later shape changes and effects===\n\nThough the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release from these processes halts, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.\n\nEarth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.\n\n===Shapes of other bodies===\n[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]\n[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko]]]]\n\nThe [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].\n\nAny natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.\n\nStars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.\n\n==Effects and empirical evidence==\n{{Anchor|Effects and empirical confirmation}} <!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.\n\n===Spacecraft===\n\nMany pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.\n\nAstronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.\n\nThe astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).\n\n===Aircraft===\n\nPeople in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})</ref> Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.\n\nThe fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant points is a [[Great-circle distance|great circle route]]. This route shows as curved on any map except for one using a [[gnomonic projection]].\n\nPhotos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface. Aerial photographs of large areas must be corrected to account for curvature.<ref>[https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1958journal/dec/1958_dec_751-756.pdf The Effects of Earth's Curvature and Refraction on the Mensuration of Vertical Photographs]</ref>\n\n===Visibility of distant objects===\n\n{{main|Horizon#Distance to the horizon}}\n\nOn a completely flat Earth with no visual interference (such as trees, hills, or atmospheric haze) the ground itself would never obscure distant objects; one would be able to see all the way to the edge of the surface.  A spherical surface has a [[horizon]] which is closer when viewed from a lower altitude.<ref name=\"smarter\">[https://www.popsci.com/10-ways-you-can-prove-earth-is-round 10 easy ways you can tell for yourself that the Earth is not flat]</ref>  In theory, a person standing on the surface with eyes {{convert|1.8|m}} above the ground can see the ground up to about {{convert|4.79|km}} away, but a person at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] at {{convert|273|m}} can see the ground up to about {{convert|58.98|km}} away.<ref>[http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/june32012/index.html Consequences of a living on a sphere]</ref>\n\nThis phenomenon would seem to present a method to verify that the Earth's surface is locally [[wikt:convex|convex]].  If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.\n\nIn practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in [[atmospheric refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the Earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the Earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).\n\nThe phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the Sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/ | title=The Perfectly Scientific Explanation for Why Chicago Appeared Upside Down in Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline | title=Mirage of Chicago skyline seen from Michigan shoreline}}</ref>\n\nWhen the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer. Likewise, in the days of sailing ships, a sailor would climb up a mast to see farther. The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)</ref><ref name=\"headsup\" />\n\n===Lunar eclipses ===\n\nThe shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the Moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.\n\nThe only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Observation of the stars at altitude===\n\nOn a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky\u2014a hemisphere of 180\u00b0. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky. For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180\u00b0 of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex. (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.\n\nWith the presumption of a spherical earth, an expedition commissioned by caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] used this phenomenon to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] to within {{convert|7920|km}} of the correct value of around {{convert|40000|km}}, and possibly as accurately as {{convert|180|km}}.<ref>{{Cite book|last=King|first=David A.|year=1996|editor-last=Rashed|editor-first=Roshdi|title=Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping|url=http://qisar.fssr.uns.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qisar-Roshdi-Rashed-Encyclopedia-of-the-History-of-Arabic-Science.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=1|pages=128\u2013184|isbn=978-0203711842|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===\n\nThe [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.\n\nThe fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.<ref name=\"headsup\">[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]</ref> This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.<ref name=\"smarter\" />\n\nAt the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180\u00b0 view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the \"North Star\") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)\n\nAt the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180\u00b0 hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).\n\nThe fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).\n\nFrom any point on the [[equator]], 360\u00b0 of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as \"the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time\").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90\u00b0 angle from the poles.\n\nThe direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40\u00b0 north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280\u00b0 (360\u00b0 - 80\u00b0).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.\n\nMaking stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.\n\nKnowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).\n\n===Surface circumnavigation===\n\nSince the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)\n\nSome flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html | title=Easy Globalist Arguments to Refute}}</ref> This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it would not be possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly {{Convert|16000|km|abbr=on}} long, as is the Antarctic Cicle.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Nuttall |first1 = Mark |title = Encyclopedia of the Arctic Volumes 1, 2 and 3 |date = 2004 |publisher = Routledge |isbn = 978-1579584368 |page = 115 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Swr9BTI_2FEC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115 |accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}</ref>. A \"true circumnavigation\" of the Earth is defined, in order to account for the shape of the Earth, to be about 2.5 times as long, including a crossing of the equator, at about {{convert|40000|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =24 August 2019}}</ref>. On the flat Earth model, the ratios would require the Antarctic Circle to be 2.5 times the length of the circumnavigation, or 2.5x2.5=6.25 times the length of the Arctic Circle.\n\nExplorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.\n\nThe first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-1958, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322 | title=Airliners.net - Aviation Forums}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/ | title=Airliners.net - Aviation Forums}}</ref>\n\n===Observing the Sun===\n\nOn a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. \n\nIn order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.<ref>claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ</ref><ref name=\"takes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}</ref> This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spend most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).\n\n====Local solar time and time zones====\n\n{{main|Time zone}}\n\nAncient timekeeping reckoned \"noon\" as the time of day when the Sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.\n\nBecause the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.\n\nThe differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.\n\n[[San Francisco]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html | title=Richmond, Virginia - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year}}</ref> is at 122.41\u00b0W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html | title=San Francisco, California - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year}}</ref> is at 77.46\u00b0W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6\u00b0N latitude (\u00b1.2\u00b0).  The approximately 45\u00b0 of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.\n\n====Length of the day====\n\nOn a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.\n\nThe movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23\u00b0 from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.\n\nThe length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.\n\nThe length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The \"spotlight Sun\" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).\n\n====Determining the shape of the Earth====\n\nOn a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.\n\nSome claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ | title=\"TOP 10 REASONS Why We Know the Earth is Round\" Debunked}}</ref> However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.\n\n====Determining the size of the Earth====\n\nUsing the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer [[Eratosthenes]] [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.\n\n====Watching the Sun set twice====\n\nOn level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/ | title=A Date Idea Analyzed| date=2009-04-06}}</ref> or a tall building with a fast elevator.<ref>[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]</ref> On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.<ref name=\"headsup\" /> \n\nWhen the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York, the aircraft outran the sun's apparent motion westward, and therefore passengers aboard observed the sun rising in the west as they traveled. After landing in New York, passengers watched a second sunset in the west.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]</ref>\n\nBecause the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.<ref name=\"twenty_four\">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns!

On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.\n\nIn [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180\u00b0 (in this example 270\u00b0, having arrived back at the north pole a 90\u00b0 angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180\u00b0.<ref>[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]</ref>\n\n===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===\n\nA [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define \"north\" and \"south\".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define \"east\" and \"west\", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.<ref>[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]</ref>\n\n===Weather systems===\n\nLow-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).\n\n===Gravity===\n\nThe laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.\n\nFrom these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,<ref name=\"smarter\" /> contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).\n\nIgnoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface \"gravity\" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.<ref name=\"takes\" /> Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.\n\n===Technology===\n\nObservation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).\n\nThe mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].\n\nSatellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.  The details of which satellites are visible from which places on the ground at which times prove an approximately spherical shape of the Earth.  (Undersea cables are also used for intercontinental communications.)\n\nRadio transmitters are mounted on tall towers because they generally rely on [[line-of-sight propagation]]. The distance to the [[horizon]] is further at higher altitude, so mounting them higher significantly increases the area they can serve.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/bob-released-neil-degrasse-tyson-diss-track | title=Why B.o.B's Neil de Grasse Tyson Diss Track is Totally Wrong}}</ref> Some signals can be transmitted at much longer distances, but only if they are at frequencies where they can use [[groundwave propagation]], [[tropospheric propagation]], [[tropospheric scatter]], or [[ionospheric propagation]] to reflect or refract signals around the curve of the Earth.\n\n===Architecture===\n\nThe design of some large structures needs to take the shape of the Earth into account.  For example, the towers of the [[Humber Bridge]], although both vertical with respect to gravity, are {{convert|36|mm|in|1|abbr=in}} farther apart at the top than the bottom due to the local curvature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitgrimsby.co.uk/humber.htm|publisher=Visit Grimsby|title=The Humber Bridge|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of geodesy}}\n{{split section|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Antiquity===\nThough the earliest written mention of a spherical Earth comes from ancient Greek sources, there is no account of how the sphericity of the Earth was discovered.<ref name=\"evans47\">James Evans, (1998), ''The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy'', page 47, Oxford University Press</ref> A plausible explanation given by the historian [[Otto E.

(''De caelo'', 297a9\u201321)\n* Travelers going south see southern constellations rise higher above the horizon; and\n* The shadow of Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is round. (''De caelo'', 297b31\u2013298a10).\n\nThe concepts of symmetry, equilibrium and cyclic repetition permeated Aristotle's work. In his [[Meteorology (Aristotle)|''Meteorology'']] he divided the world into five climatic zones: two temperate areas separated by a torrid zone near the [[equator]], and two cold inhospitable regions, \"one near our upper or northern pole and the other near the [[...]] southern pole,\" both impenetrable and girdled with ice (''Meteorologica'', 362a31\u201335). Although no humans could survive in the frigid zones, inhabitants in the southern temperate regions could exist.\n\n[[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotle's theory of natural place]] relied on a spherical Earth to explain why [[Earth (classical element)|heavy things]] go down (toward what Aristotle believed was the center of the Universe), and things like [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] go up. In this [[geocentric model]], the structure of the universe was believed to be a series of perfect spheres. The Sun, Moon, planets and fixed stars were believed to move on [[celestial spheres]] around a stationary Earth.\n\nThough Aristotle's theory of physics survived in the Christian world for many centuries, the [[heliocentric model]] was eventually shown to be a more correct explanation of the [[Solar System]] than the geocentric model, and [[atomic theory]] was shown to be a more correct explanation of the nature of matter than [[classical element]]s like earth, water, air, fire, and aether.\n\n=====Archimedes=====\nIn proposition 2 of the First Book of his treatise \"On floating bodies,\" [[Archimedes]] demonstrates that \"The surface of any fluid at rest is the surface of a sphere whose centre is the same as that of the Earth\".<ref>{{cite book | translator-last = Heath | translator-first = T.

In the ''[[Almagest]],'' which remained the standard work of astronomy for 1,400 years, he advanced many arguments for the spherical nature of the Earth. Among them was the observation that when a ship is sailing towards [[mountain]]s, observers note these seem to rise from the sea, indicating that they were hidden by the curved surface of the sea. He also gives separate arguments that the Earth is curved north-south and that it is curved east-west.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Ptolemy | title = Almagest | pages = I.4}} as quoted in {{Cite book| first = Edward | last = Grant | title = A Source Book in Medieval Science | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 1974 | pages = 63\u20134}}</ref>\n\nHe compiled an eight-volume ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' covering what was known about the Earth. The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].\n\n''Geographia'' indicated the countries of \"[[Seres|Serica]]\" and \"Sinae\" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of \"Taprobane\" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the \"Aurea Chersonesus\" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).\n\nPtolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumen\u00e8'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumen\u00e8'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]]. Ptolemy was well aware that he knew about only a quarter of the globe.\n\n=====Late Antiquity=====\nKnowledge of the spherical shape of the Earth was received in scholarship of [[Late Antiquity]] as a matter of course, in both [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Early Christianity]]. [[Calcidius]]'s fourth-century [[Latin language|Latin]] commentary on and translation of Plato's ''Timaeus'', which was one of the few examples of Greek scientific thought that was known in the Early Middle Ages in Western Europe, discussed [[Hipparchus]]'s use of the geometrical circumstances of eclipses to compute the [[On Sizes and Distances|relative diameters]] of the Sun, Earth, and Moon.<ref>{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | title = Astronomies and Cultures in Early Medieval Europe | place = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = 1998 | pages = 119\u2013120 | isbn = 978-0-521-77852-7 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author = Calcidius | author-link = Calcidius | editor-last = Klibansky| editor-first = Raymond| editor-link = Raymond Klibansky| date = 1962 | title = Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus | series = Corpus Platonicum Medii Aevi, Plato Latinus | volume = 4 | publisher = Brill / Warburg Institute| location = Leiden / London | pages = 141\u2013144 | isbn = 9780854810529 }}</ref>\n\nTheological doubt informed by the [[flat Earth]] model implied in the [[Hebrew Bible]] inspired some early Christian scholars such as [[Lactantius]], [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], but this remained an eccentric current.

Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] (\"Erdmessung\" or \"h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie\"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] (\"Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie\"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.\n\nThe Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;\n* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or\n* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.\n\nAs the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]].

Other speculations on the shape of Earth include a seven-layered [[ziggurat]] or [[cosmic mountain]], alluded to in the [[Avesta]] and ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] writings (see [[seven climes]]).\n\nThe realization that the [[figure of the Earth]] is more accurately described as an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] dates to the 17th century, as described by [[Isaac Newton]] in ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. In the early 19th century, the flattening of the earth ellipsoid was determined to be of the order of 1/300 ([[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]], [[George Everest|Everest]]). The modern value as determined by the [[United States Department of Defense|US DoD]] [[World Geodetic System]] since the 1960s is close to 1/298.25.<ref>See [[figure of the Earth]] and [[Earth radius#Mean radii|Earth radius]] for details.

Hugh Thurston, ''Early Astronomy'', (New York: Springer-Verlag), p. 119. {{ISBN|0-387-94107-X}}.</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nThe Earth is massive enough that the pull of [[gravity]] maintains its roughly spherical shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the [[centrifugal force]] caused by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an [[oblate ellipsoid]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/planets-round/en/|title=Why Are Planets Round? {{!}} NASA Space Place \u2013 NASA Science for Kids|website=spaceplace.nasa.gov|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Formation===\n{{further|History of Earth|Equatorial bulge}}\n\nThe [[formation and evolution of the Solar System|Solar System formed]] from a dust cloud that was at least partially the remnant of one or more [[supernova]]s that created heavy elements by [[nucleosynthesis]]. Grains of matter accreted through electrostatic interaction. As they grew in mass, gravity took over in gathering yet more mass, releasing the [[potential energy]] of their collisions and in-falling as [[heat]]. The [[protoplanetary disk]] also had a greater proportion of radioactive elements than the Earth today because, over time, those elements decayed. Their decay heated the early Earth even further, and continue to contribute to [[Earth's internal heat budget]]. The early Earth was thus mostly liquid.\n\nA sphere is the only stable shape for a non-rotating, gravitationally self-attracting liquid. The outward acceleration caused by the Earth's rotation is greater at the equator than at the poles (where is it zero), so the sphere gets deformed into an [[ellipsoid]], which represents the shape having the lowest potential energy for a rotating, fluid body. This ellipsoid is slightly fatter around the equator than a perfect sphere would be. Earth's shape is also slightly lumpy because it is composed of different materials of different densities that exert slightly different amounts of gravitational force per volume.\n\nThe liquidity of a hot, newly formed planet allows heavier elements to sink down to the middle and forces lighter elements closer to the surface, a process known as [[planetary differentiation]]. This event is known as the [[iron catastrophe]]; the most abundant heavier elements were [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which now form the [[Earth's core]].\n\n===Later shape changes and effects===\n\nThough the surface rocks of the Earth have cooled enough to solidify, the [[outer core]] of the planet is still hot enough to remain liquid. Energy is still being released; [[volcano|volcanic]] and [[tectonic]] activity has pushed rocks into hills and mountains and blown them out of [[caldera]]s. [[Meteor]]s also create [[impact crater]]s and surrounding ridges. However, if the energy release from these processes halts, then they tend to [[Erosion|erode]] away over time and return toward the lowest potential-energy curve of the ellipsoid. [[Weather]] powered by [[solar energy]] can also move water, rock, and soil to make the Earth slightly out of round.\n\nEarth undulates as the shape of its lowest potential energy changes daily due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon as they move around with respect to the Earth. This is what causes [[tides]] in the [[ocean]]s' water, which can flow freely along the changing potential.\n\n===Shapes of other bodies===\n[[File:Eros, Vesta and Ceres size comparison.jpg|thumb|Composite image showing the round dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]; the slightly smaller, mostly round [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]; and the much smaller, much lumpier [[433 Eros|Eros]]]]\n[[File:Comet 67P on 19 September 2014 NavCam mosaic.jpg|thumb|The amorphous nucleus of the comet [[67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko]]]]\n\nThe [[IAU definition of planet|IAU definitions of planet]] and [[dwarf planet]] require that a Sun-orbiting body has undergone the rounding process to reach a roughly spherical shape, an achievement known as [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. The same spheroidal shape can be seen from smaller rocky planets like [[Mars]] to [[gas giant]]s like [[Jupiter]].\n\nAny natural Sun-orbiting body that has not reached hydrostatic equilibrium is classified by the IAU as a [[small Solar System body]] (SSB). These come in many non-spherical shapes which are lumpy masses accreted haphazardly by in-falling dust and rock; not enough mass falls in to generate the heat needed to complete the rounding. Some SSSBs are just collections of relatively small rocks that are weakly held next to each other by gravity but are not actually fused into a single big [[bedrock]]. Some larger SSSBs are nearly round but have not reached hydrostatic equilibrium. The small Solar System body [[4 Vesta]] is large enough to have undergone at least partial planetary differentiation.\n\nStars like the Sun are also spheroidal due to gravity's effects on their [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], which is a free-flowing [[fluid]]. Ongoing [[stellar fusion]] is a much greater source of heat for stars compared to the initial heat released during formation.\n\n==Effects and empirical evidence==\n{{Anchor|Effects and empirical confirmation}} <!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The shape causes a number of phenomena that a flat Earth would not.  Some of these phenomena and observations would be possible on other shapes, such as a curved [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] or [[torus]], but no other shape would explain all of them.\n\n===Spacecraft===\n\nMany pictures have been taken of the entire Earth by satellites launched by a variety of governments and private organizations. From high orbits, where half the planet can be seen at once, it is plainly spherical.  The only way to piece together all the pictures taken of the ground from lower orbits so that all the surface features line up seamlessly and without distortion is to put them on an approximately spherical surface.\n\nAstronauts in [[low Earth orbit]] can personally see the curvature of the planet, and travel all the way around several times a day.\n\nThe astronauts who travelled to the Moon have seen the entire Moon-facing half at once, and can watch the sphere rotate once a day (approximately; the Moon is also moving with respect to the Earth).\n\n===Aircraft===\n\nPeople in high-flying aircraft or skydiving from high-altitude balloons can plainly see the curvature of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OnJCqtTxsA James May Witnesses Curvature of Earth] (at {{convert|70000|ft}})</ref> Commercial aircraft do not necessarily fly high enough to make this obvious.  Trying to measure the curvature of the horizon by taking a picture is complicated by the fact that camera lenses can produce distorted images depending on the angle used.  An extreme version of this effect can be seen in the [[fisheye lens]].  Scientific measurements would require a carefully calibrated lens.\n\nThe fastest way for an airplane to travel between two distant points is a [[Great-circle distance|great circle route]]. This route shows as curved on any map except for one using a [[gnomonic projection]].\n\nPhotos of the ground taken from airplanes over a large enough area also do not fit seamlessly together on a flat surface, but do fit on a roughly spherical surface.

If the degree of curvature was determined to be the same everywhere on the Earth's surface, and that surface was determined to be large enough, it would show that the Earth is spherical.\n\nIn practice, this turns out to be an unreliable method of measurement, due to variations in [[atmospheric refraction]].  This additional effect can give the impression that the Earth's surface is flat, curved more convexly than it is, or even that it is [[wikt:concave|concave]], by bending light travelling near the surface of the Earth (as happened in various trials of the famous [[Bedford Level experiment]]).\n\nThe phenomenon of variable atmospheric bending can be empirically confirmed by noting that sometimes the refractive layers of air can cause the image of a distant object to be broken into pieces or even turned upside down.  This is commonly seen at sunset, when the Sun's shape is distorted, but has also been photographed happening for ships, and has caused the city of Chicago to appear normally, upside down, and broken into pieces from across Lake Michigan (from where it is normally below the horizon).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/the-perfectly-scientific-explanation-for-why-chicago-appeared-upside-down-in-michigan/ | title=The Perfectly Scientific Explanation for Why Chicago Appeared Upside Down in Michigan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.abc57.com/story/28925566/mirage-of-chicago-skyline-seen-from-michigan-shoreline | title=Mirage of Chicago skyline seen from Michigan shoreline}}</ref>\n\nWhen the atmosphere is relatively well-mixed, the visual effects generally expected of a spherical Earth can be observed.  For example, ships travelling on large bodies of water (such as the ocean) disappear over the horizon progressively, such that the highest part of the ship can still be seen even when lower parts cannot, proportional to distance from the observer. Likewise, in the days of sailing ships, a sailor would climb up a mast to see farther. The same is true of the coastline or mountain when viewed from a ship or from across a large lake or flat terrain.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bco_p4V7-QU A video showing the curvature of the Earth] (using island coastline)</ref><ref name=\"headsup\" />\n\n===Lunar eclipses ===\n\nThe shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a [[lunar eclipse]] is always a dark circle that moves from one side of the Moon to the other (partially grazing it during a partial eclipse).  This could be produced by a flat disc that always faces the Moon head-on during the eclipse, but this is inconsistent with the fact that the Moon is only rarely directly overhead during an eclipse. For each eclipse, the local surface of the Earth is pointed in a somewhat different direction.  The shadow of a circular disc held at an angle is an oval, not a circle as is seen during the eclipse.  The idea of the Earth being a flat disc is also inconsistent with the fact that a given lunar eclipse is only visible from half of the Earth at a time.\n\nThe only shape that casts a round shadow no matter which direction it is pointed is a sphere, and the ancient Greeks deduced that this must mean the Earth is spherical.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pollack|first1=Rebecca|title=Ancient Myths Revised with Lunar Eclipse|url=https://www.astro.umd.edu/openhouse/3about-the-obs/news/2003-11-10.html|publisher=University of Maryland|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Observation of the stars at altitude===\n\nOn a perfectly spherical Earth, flat terrain or ocean, when viewed from the surface, blocks exactly half the sky\u2014a hemisphere of 180\u00b0. Moving away from the surface of the Earth means that the ground blocks less and less of the sky. For example, when viewed from the Moon, the Earth blocks only a small portion of the sky, because it is so distant.  This phenomenon of geometry means that when viewed from a high mountain, flat ground or ocean blocks less than 180\u00b0 of the sky. The rate of change in the angle blocked by the sky as altitude increases is different for a disc than a sphere, and values observed show that the Earth is locally convex. (The angles blocked would also be different for a mountain close to the edge of a flat Earth compared to a mountain in the middle of a flat Earth, and this is not observed.)  In theory, measurements of this type from all around the Earth would confirm that it is a complete sphere (as opposed to some other shape with convex areas) though actually taking all those measurements would be very expensive.\n\nWith the presumption of a spherical earth, an expedition commissioned by caliph [[al-Ma'mun]] used this phenomenon to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] to within {{convert|7920|km}} of the correct value of around {{convert|40000|km}}, and possibly as accurately as {{convert|180|km}}.<ref>{{Cite book|last=King|first=David A.|year=1996|editor-last=Rashed|editor-first=Roshdi|title=Astronomy and Islamic society: Qibla, gnomics and timekeeping|url=http://qisar.fssr.uns.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Qisar-Roshdi-Rashed-Encyclopedia-of-the-History-of-Arabic-Science.pdf|journal=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|volume=1|pages=128\u2013184|isbn=978-0203711842|access-date=24 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Observation of the fixed stars from different locations===\n\nThe [[fixed stars]] can be demonstrated to be very far away, by [[diurnal parallax]] measurements (a technique known at least as early as Ancient Greece).  Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another (at least not perceptibly over the span of a human lifetime); the shapes of the [[constellation]]s are always the same.  This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of the Earth.  Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of the Earth's size.\n\nThe fact that different stars are visible from different locations on the Earth was noticed in ancient times. [[Aristotle]] wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe.<ref name=\"headsup\">[http://headsup.boyslife.org/ten-reasons-we-know-earth-is-round/ How We Know the Earth Is Actually Round]</ref> This would not be possible if the Earth was flat.<ref name=\"smarter\" />\n\nAt the [[North Pole]] it is continuously nighttime for six months of the year and the same hemisphere of stars (a 180\u00b0 view) are always visible making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star [[Polaris]] (the \"North Star\") is almost at the center of this rotation (which is directly overhead). Some of the [[88 modern constellations]] visible are [[Ursa Major]] (including the [[Big Dipper]]), [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]], and [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]. The other six months of the year, it is continuously daytime and the light from the Sun mostly blots out the stars.  (The location of the poles can be defined by these phenomena, which only occur there; more than 24 hours of continuous daylight can occur north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]].)\n\nAt the [[South Pole]], a completely non-overlapping set of constellations are visible during the six months of continuous nighttime, including [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Crux]], and [[Centaurus]].  This 180\u00b0 hemisphere of stars rotate clockwise once every 24 hours, around a point directly overhead (where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars).\n\nThe fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of the Earth, which is not possible if the Earth is a single-sided disc, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell).\n\nFrom any point on the [[equator]], 360\u00b0 of stars are visible over the course of the night, as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south (which could be defined as \"the directions to walk to get to the poles in the shortest amount of time\").  When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right.  This means the equator must be facing at a 90\u00b0 angle from the poles.\n\nThe direction any intermediate spot on the Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles of the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible.  For example, [[New York City]] is about 40\u00b0 north of the equator.  The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280\u00b0 (360\u00b0 - 80\u00b0).  So for example, both [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and the [[Big Dipper]] are visible during at least part of the year.\n\nMaking stellar observations from a representative set of points across the Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for the Earth.\n\nKnowing the difference in angle between two points on the Earth's surface and the surface distance between them allows a calculation of the Earth's size.  Using observations at [[Rhodes]] (in Greece) and [[Alexandria]] (in Egypt) and the distance between them, the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Posidonius#Geography, ethnology, and geology|Posidonius]] actually did use this technique to calculate the circumference of the planet to within perhaps 4% of the correct value (though modern equivalents of his units of measure are not precisely known).\n\n===Surface circumnavigation===\n\nSince the 1500s, many people have sailed or flown completely around the world in all directions, and none have discovered an edge or impenetrable barrier.  (See [[Circumnavigation]], [[Arctic exploration]], and [[History of Antarctica]].)\n\nSome flat Earth theories that propose the world is a north-pole-centered disc, conceive of Antarctica as an impenetrable ice wall that encircles the planet and hides any edges.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.testingtheglobe.com/quest2.html | title=Easy Globalist Arguments to Refute}}</ref> This disc model explains east-west circumnavigation as simply moving around the disc in a circle.  (East-west paths form a circle in both disc and spherical geometry.)  It is possible in this model to traverse the North Pole, but it would not be possible to perform a circumnavigation that includes the South Pole (which it posits does not exist).\n\nThe Arctic Circle is roughly {{Convert|16000|km|abbr=on}} long, as is the Antarctic Cicle.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Nuttall |first1 = Mark |title = Encyclopedia of the Arctic Volumes 1, 2 and 3 |date = 2004 |publisher = Routledge |isbn = 978-1579584368 |page = 115 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Swr9BTI_2FEC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115 |accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}</ref>. A \"true circumnavigation\" of the Earth is defined, in order to account for the shape of the Earth, to be about 2.5 times as long, including a crossing of the equator, at about {{convert|40000|km|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =24 August 2019}}</ref>. On the flat Earth model, the ratios would require the Antarctic Circle to be 2.5 times the length of the circumnavigation, or 2.5x2.5=6.25 times the length of the Arctic Circle.\n\nExplorers, government researchers, commercial pilots, and tourists have been to [[Antarctica]] and found that it is not a large ring that encircles the entire world, but actually a roughly disc-shaped continent smaller than South America but larger than Australia, with an interior that can in fact be traversed in order to take a shorter path from e.g. the tip of South America to Australia than would be possible on a disc.\n\nThe first land crossing of the entirety of Antarctica was the [[Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] in 1955-1958, and many exploratory airplanes have since passed over the continent in various directions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2300322 | title=Airliners.net - Aviation Forums}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.airliners.net/aviation-forums/general_aviation/read.main/2372669/ | title=Airliners.net - Aviation Forums}}</ref>\n\n===Observing the Sun===\n\nOn a flat Earth, an omnidirectional Sun (emitting light in all directions, as it does) would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at the same time (with some small variations due to mountains and valleys). With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time (the hemisphere facing the Sun) and the other half is experiencing nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its [[antipodes|antipode]] - the location exactly on the opposite side of the Earth - is always experiencing nighttime. The spherical shape of the Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight each day. \n\nIn order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth theorists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time.<ref>claimed by http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ</ref><ref name=\"takes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/10/28/what-does-take-believe-world-flat/0gdgl2JMPhBpgJK5mGXPkI/story.html |title=What does it take to believe the world is flat? |date=28 October 2017 |author=Courtney Humphries}}</ref> This theory is not consistent with observation; at sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming light travels in straight lines, actual measurements of the Sun's angle in the sky from locations very distant from each other are only consistent with a geometry where the Sun is very far away and is being seen from a hemispherical surface (the daylight half of the Earth).  These two phenomena are related: a low-altitude spotlight Sun would spend most of the day near the horizon for most locations on Earth (which is not observed), but rise and set fairly close to the horizon.  A high-altitude Sun would spend more of the day away from the horizon, but rise and set fairly far from the horizon (which is not observed).\n\n====Local solar time and time zones====\n\n{{main|Time zone}}\n\nAncient timekeeping reckoned \"noon\" as the time of day when the Sun is highest in the sky, with the rest of the hours in the day measured against that.  During the day, the [[apparent solar time]] can be measured directly with a [[sundial]].  In ancient Egypt, the first known sundials divided the day into 12 hours, though because the length of the day changed with the season, the length of the hours also changed.  Sundials that defined hours as always being the same duration appeared in the [[Renaissance]].  In Western Europe, [[clock tower]]s and [[striking clock]]s were used in the Middle Ages to keep people nearby appraised of the local time, though compared to modern times this was less important in a largely agrarian society.\n\nBecause the Sun reaches its highest point at different times for different [[longitude]]s (about four minutes of time for every degree of longitude difference east or west), the local solar noon in each city is different except for those directly north or south of each other.  This means that the clocks in different cities could be offset from each other by minutes or hours.  As clocks became more precise and industrialization made timekeeping more important, cities switched to [[mean solar time]], which ignores minor variations in the timing of local solar noon over the year, due to the elliptical nature of the Earth's orbit, and its tilt.\n\nThe differences in clock time between cities was not generally a problem until the advent of [[railroad]] travel in the 1800s, which both made travel between distant cities much faster than by walking or horse, and also required passengers to show up at specific times to meet their desired trains.  In the [[United Kingdom]], railroads gradually switched to [[Greenwich Mean Time]] (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone.  In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour.  At first railroad time was synchronized by portable [[Railroad chronometer|chronometer]]s, and then later by [[telegraph]] and [[radio]] signals.\n\n[[San Francisco]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/richmond-virginia.html | title=Richmond, Virginia - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year}}</ref> is at 122.41\u00b0W longitude and [[Richmond, Virginia]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gaisma.com/en/location/san-francisco-california.html | title=San Francisco, California - Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year}}</ref> is at 77.46\u00b0W longitude.  They are both at about 37.6\u00b0N latitude (\u00b1.2\u00b0).  The approximately 45\u00b0 of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example.  San Francisco is in the [[Pacific Time]] zone, and Richmond is in the [[Eastern Time]] zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone.  But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California.\n\n====Length of the day====\n\nOn a flat Earth with an omnidirectional Sun, all places would experience the same amount of daylight every day, and all places would get daylight at the same time.  Actual day length varies considerably, with places closer to the poles getting very long days in the summer and very short days in the winter, with northerly summer happening at the same time as southerly winter.  Places north of the [[Arctic Circle]] and south of the [[Antarctic Circle]] get no sunlight for at least one day a year, and get 24-hour sunlight for at least one day a year.  Both the poles experience sunlight for 6 months and darkness for 6 months, at opposite times.\n\nThe movement of daylight between the northern and southern hemispheres happens because of the [[axial tilt]] of the Earth.  The imaginary line around which the Earth spins, which goes between the North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23\u00b0 from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun.  The Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year ([[summer]] in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of the Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt).  For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is [[winter]] in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the [[autumnal equinox]] and [[vernal equinox]], when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.\n\nThe length of the day varies because as the Earth rotates some places (near the poles) pass through only a short curve near the top or bottom of the sunlight half; other places (near the equator) travel along much longer curves through the middle.\n\nThe length of [[twilight]] would be very different on a flat Earth. On a round Earth, the atmosphere above the ground is lit for a while before sunrise and after sunset are observed at ground level, because the Sun is still visible from higher altitudes.  Longer twilights are observed at higher latitudes (near the poles) due to a shallower angle of the Sun's apparent movement compared to the horizon.  On a flat Earth, the Sun's shadow would reach the upper atmosphere very quickly, except near the closest edge of the Earth, and would always set at the same angle to the ground (which is not what is observed).  The \"spotlight Sun\" theory is also not consistent with this observation, since the air cannot be lit without the ground below it also being lit (except for shadows of mountains and other surface obstacles).\n\n====Determining the shape of the Earth====\n\nOn a given day, if many different cities measure the angle of the Sun at local noon, the resulting data, when combined with the known distances between cities, shows that the Earth has 180 degrees of north-south curvature.  (A full range of angles will be observed if the north and south poles are included, and the day chosen is either the autumnal or spring equinox.)  This is consistent with many rounded shapes, including a sphere, and is inconsistent with a flat shape.\n\nSome claim that this experiment assumes a very distant Sun, such that the incoming rays are essentially parallel, and if a flat Earth is assumed, that the measured angles can allow one to calculate the distance to the Sun, which must be small enough that its incoming rays are not very parallel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.theflatearthsociety.org/forum/index.php?topic=58309.0#.VuJqbULlyPZ | title=\"TOP 10 REASONS Why We Know the Earth is Round\" Debunked}}</ref> However, if more than two relatively well-separated cities are included in the experiment, the calculation will make clear whether the Sun is distant or nearby.  For example, on the equinox, the 0 degree angle from the North Pole and the 90 degree angle from the equator predict a Sun which would have to be located essentially next to the surface of a flat Earth, but the difference in angle between the equator and New York City would predict a Sun much further away if the Earth is flat.  Because these results are contradictory, the surface of the Earth cannot be flat; the data ''is'' consistent with a nearly spherical Earth and a Sun which is very far away compared with the diameter of the Earth.\n\n====Determining the size of the Earth====\n\nUsing the knowledge that the Sun is very far away, the ancient Greek geographer [[Eratosthenes]] [[Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference|performed an experiment]] using the differences in the observed angle of the Sun from two different locations to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Though modern telecommunications and timekeeping were not available, he was able to make sure the measurements happened at the same time by having them taken when the Sun was highest in the sky (local noon) at both locations. Using slightly inaccurate assumptions about the locations of two cities, he came to a result within 15% of the correct value.\n\n====Watching the Sun set twice====\n\nOn level ground, the difference in the distance to the horizon between lying down and standing up is large enough to watch the Sun set twice by quickly standing up immediately after seeing it set for the first time while lying down.  This also can be done with a [[cherry picker]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/06/a-date-idea-analyzed/ | title=A Date Idea Analyzed| date=2009-04-06}}</ref> or a tall building with a fast elevator.<ref>[https://gizmodo.com/5917230/did-you-know-that-the-burj-khalifa-is-so-tall-that-you-can-watch-two-sunsets-on-the-same-day Did You Know That the Burj Khalifa Is So Tall That you Can Watch Two Sunsets On the Same Day?]</ref> On a flat Earth, one would not be able to see the Sun again (unless standing near the edge closest to the Sun) due to a much faster-moving Sun shadow.<ref name=\"headsup\" /> \n\nWhen the supersonic [[Concorde]] took off not long after sunset from London and flew westward to New York, the aircraft outran the sun's apparent motion westward, and therefore passengers aboard observed the sun rising in the west as they traveled. After landing in New York, passengers watched a second sunset in the west.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/concorde-and-supersonic-travel-the-days-when-the-sun-rose-in-the-west-8888836.html Concorde and supersonic travel: The days when the sun rose in the west]</ref>\n\nBecause the speed of the Sun's shadow is slower in polar regions (due to the steeper angle), even a subsonic aircraft can overtake the sunset when flying at high latitudes. One photographer used a roughly circular route around the North Pole to take pictures of 24 sunsets in the same 24-hour period, pausing westward progress in each time zone to let the shadow of the Sun catch up.<ref name=\"twenty_four\">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2788267/here-comes-suns-photographer-travels-time-zone-capture-24-sunsets-one-day.html Here comes the suns!

On a flat Earth, the aircraft would have travelled along three sides of a square, and arrive at a spot about {{convert|10000|km}} from where it started. But because the Earth is spherical, in reality it will have travelled along three sides of a triangle, and arrive back very close to its starting point.  If the starting point is the North Pole, it would have travelled due south from the North Pole to the equator, then west for a quarter of the way around the Earth, and then due north back to the North Pole.\n\nIn [[spherical geometry]], the sum of angles inside a triangle is greater than 180\u00b0 (in this example 270\u00b0, having arrived back at the north pole a 90\u00b0 angle to the departure path) unlike on a flat surface, where it is always exactly 180\u00b0.<ref>[http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/tripleright.jpg Triple-right triangle on a sphere (image)]</ref>\n\n===Grids are distorted by spherical ground===\n\nA [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of [[longitude]] is a line where local solar noon occurs at the same time each day.  These lines define \"north\" and \"south\".  These are perpendicular to lines of [[latitude]] that define \"east\" and \"west\", where the Sun is at the same angle at local noon on the same day.  If the Sun were travelling from east to west over a flat Earth, meridian lines would always be the same distance apart - they would form a square grid when combined with lines of latitude. In reality, meridian lines get farther apart as one travels toward the equator, which is only possible on a round Earth.  In places where land is plotted on a grid system, this causes discontinuities in the grid.  For example, in areas of the [[Midwestern United States]] that use the [[Public Land Survey System]], the northernmost and westernmost sections of a [[township]] deviate from what would otherwise be an exact square mile.  The resulting discontinuities are sometimes reflected directly in local roads, which have kinks where the grid cannot follow completely straight lines.<ref>[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/gerco-de-ruijter-grid-corrections-highways-driving-wichita Mysterious Detour While Driving? It Could Be Due to the Curvature of the Earth]</ref>\n\n===Weather systems===\n\nLow-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a [[hurricane]]) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator.  This is due to the [[Coriolis force]], and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of the Earth are angled in opposite directions (e.g. the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).\n\n===Gravity===\n\nThe laws of [[gravity]], [[chemistry]], and [[physics]] that explain the formation and rounding of the Earth are well-tested through experiment, and applied successfully to many engineering tasks.\n\nFrom these laws, we know the amount of mass the Earth contains, and that a non-spherical planet the size of the Earth would not be able to support itself against its own gravity.  A flat disc the size of the Earth, for example, would likely crack, heat up, liquefy, and re-form into a roughly spherical shape.  On a disc strong enough to maintain its shape, gravity would not pull downward with respect to the surface, but would pull toward the center of the disc,<ref name=\"smarter\" /> contrary to what is observed on level terrain (and which would create major problems with oceans flowing toward the center of the disk).\n\nIgnoring the other concerns, some flat Earth theorists explain the observed surface \"gravity\" by proposing that the flat Earth is constantly accelerating upwards.<ref name=\"takes\" /> Such a theory would also leave open for explanation the [[tide]]s seen in Earth's oceans, which are conventionally explained by the gravity exerted by the Sun and Moon.\n\n===Technology===\n\nObservation of [[Foucault pendulum]]s, popular in science museums around the world, demonstrate both that the world is spherical and that it rotates (not that the stars are rotating around it).\n\nThe mathematics of navigation by [[GPS]] assume that satellites are moving in known orbits around an approximately spherical surface.  The accuracy of GPS navigation in determining latitude and longitude and the way these numbers map onto locations on the ground show that these assumptions are correct.  The same is true for the operational [[GLONASS]] system run by Russia, and the in-development European [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]], and Indian [[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System|IRNSS]].\n\nSatellites, including communications satellites used for television, telephone, and Internet connections, would not stay in orbit unless the modern theory of gravitation were correct.

The first part of the ''Geographia'' is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the Solar System in the ''Almagest'', Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned [[coordinate]]s to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). [[Latitude]] was measured from the [[equator]], as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than [[degree (angle)|degrees of arc]] (the length of the [[midsummer]] day increases from 12h to 24h as you go from the equator to the [[polar circle]]). He put the [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] of 0 [[longitude]] at the most western land he knew, the [[Canary Islands]].\n\n''Geographia'' indicated the countries of \"[[Seres|Serica]]\" and \"Sinae\" ([[China]]) at the extreme right, beyond the island of \"Taprobane\" ([[Sri Lanka]], oversized) and the \"Aurea Chersonesus\" ([[Southeast Asia|Southeast Asian peninsula]]).\n\nPtolemy also devised and provided instructions on how to create maps both of the whole inhabited world (''oikoumen\u00e8'') and of the Roman provinces. In the second part of the ''Geographia,'' he provided the necessary [[topographic]] lists, and captions for the maps. His ''oikoumen\u00e8'' spanned 180 degrees of longitude from the Canary Islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to [[China]], and about 81 degrees of latitude from the Arctic to the [[East Indies]] and deep into [[Africa]].

Especially in the [[German language|German]] speaking world, geodesy is divided into [[geomensuration]] (\"Erdmessung\" or \"h\u00f6here Geod\u00e4sie\"), which is concerned with measuring the Earth on a global scale, and [[Geophysical survey|surveying]] (\"Ingenieurgeod\u00e4sie\"), which is concerned with measuring parts of the surface.\n\nThe Earth's shape can be thought of in at least two ways;\n* as the shape of the [[geoid]], the mean sea level of the world ocean; or\n* as the shape of Earth's land surface as it rises above and falls below the sea.\n\nAs the science of [[geodesy]] measured Earth more accurately, the shape of the geoid was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an [[spheroid|oblate spheroid]], a specific type of [[ellipsoid]]. More recent measurements have measured the geoid to unprecedented accuracy, revealing [[Mass concentration (astronomy)|mass concentration]]s beneath Earth's surface.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Celestial sphere]]\n*[[Celestial spheres]]\n*[[Earth radius]]\n*[[Flat Earth]]\n*[[Geographical distance]]\n*[[Myth of the flat Earth]]\n*[[Physical geodesy]]\n*[[Terra Australis]]\n*[[WGS 84]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|title = Janice VanCleave's Science Through the Ages|author = Janice VanCleave|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|date = 2002|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RFp4KeYt9s8C|isbn = 9780471208303}}\n*{{cite book|title = Early Astronomy and Cosmology : A Reconstruction of the Earliest Cosmic System, Etc.|author=Menon, CPS | location = Whitegishm MT, USA. |publisher = Kessinger Publishing | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qnz2vGVaPjsC&pg=PA68|isbn=9780766131040 |date=2003}}\n*{{cite book |title=How Did We Find Out the Earth is Round? |author=Isaac Asimov |year=1972 |isbn=978-0802761217 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/earthisround00asim }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons-inline|Spherical Earth}}\n*[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_087.html You say the earth is round?

Retrieved 27 January 2009.</ref> which has been represented by [[Kieran Mullan]] since the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]].\n\n== History of Willaston ==\nWillaston is believed to have taken its name from an ancient farmstead known as Wiglaf's tun. Like other English villages, the name has been changed many times over the centuries. This is due to the neighbouring parish of Wistaston having a similar sounding name. To add confusion, Willaston was once ecclesiastically divided between the neighbouring communities of Nantwich and Wybunbury.\n\nWhilst there are at least two other villages called Willaston, the earliest documentary evidence relating to Willaston in this part of Cheshire can be found in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey of 1086, where is it referred to as Wilavestune. We know by reading this document that a 'free man' by the name of Ulviet once owned Wilvastune and that, just a few years after the Norman conquest, the title passed to Willam Malbank. The manor of Wilvastune remained in the Malbank family for several generations before ownership transferred to the Chanu family in the 13th century.\n\nAt this time, Willaston was a remote, sparsely populated community with no village centre. Nevertheless, it covered a much larger area than it does today, stretching from Newcastle Road and London Road Nantwich in the south, along Millstone Lane and as far as the ancient grazing land of Beam Heath in the north. These boundaries did not change until 1936, when local government decided to transfer some of Willaston's land to the expanding communities of [[Nantwich]] and Stapeley. In 1553, the manor of Willaston was bought by Richard Sneyd. Recorder of Chester. The Sneyd family lived at [[Keele Hall]] in Staffordshire and were the major landowners in WIllaston until the middle of the 19th century. \n\nAlthough Willaston had a number of farmsteads in the middle ages, most of the surrounding landscape was uncultivated. However, this began to change as more and more common land began to fall into private ownership during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The process (known as 'enclosure') brought major changes to rural communities such as Willaston, as individual plots of land were fenced off and used for arable farming, meadows and the grazing of livestock. The Sneyd family were absentee landlords but they owned most of the lands in Willaston from 1533 to the late 19th century. \n\nUnfortunately, the medieval moated site of the Chanu family was lost during the construction of the Nantwich by-pass in 1989. It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://willastonparishcouncil.org.uk/files/Willaston_Parish_Plan_2009.pdf|title=Willaston Parish Plan - History of Willaston|last=|first=|date=|website=Willaston Parish Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Local amenities==\nThe village centre of Willaston has two [[public house]]s (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an [[off-licence]] provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road. A plant nursery and garden centre is located on Crewe Road.\n\nWillaston Primary School<ref>[http://clc2.uniservity.com/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=71339 Willaston Primary School Website] . Retrieved May 18th 2010.</ref> is the only education establishment in the village. For children of pre-school age, there is an Ofsted registered playgroup in the village.\n\nA [[Red telephone box|K6]] telephone box is located in the village on Wistaston Road and has been in place since the late 1940's. The box was decommissioned by [[BT Group|British Telecom]] in 2010. The telephone box was purchased by Willaston Parish Council and turned into a book exchange known as the book box. A restoration was carried out in September 2019.\n[[File:Willaston_Book_Box.jpg|thumb|Former K6 Telephone box converted into a book exchange box]]\n\n==Local events==\n[[File:Willaston - Worm Charming.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Worm Charming Championships]] have been held in Willaston since 1980.]]\nOne of the major events in Willaston is the [[World Worm Charming Championships]]. It was started in 1980 by John Bailey. The event attracts many competitors from around the world, from the U.S. to Australia. The original event in 1980 was won with a total of 511 worms by Tom Shufflebotham - a record that stood until 2009.\n\nCelebrities that have taken part in the championships include [[Ben Fogle]] and [[Bob Carolgees]].

It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://willastonparishcouncil.org.uk/files/Willaston_Parish_Plan_2009.pdf|title=Willaston Parish Plan - History of Willaston|last=|first=|date=|website=Willaston Parish Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Local amenities==\nThe village centre of Willaston has two [[public house]]s (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an [[off-licence]] provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road. A plant nursery and garden centre is located on Crewe Road.\n\nWillaston Primary School<ref>[http://clc2.uniservity.com/Grouphomepage.asp?GroupId=71339 Willaston Primary School Website] .

For children of pre-school age, there is an Ofsted registered playgroup in the village.\n\nA [[Red telephone box|K6]] telephone box is located in the village on Wistaston Road and has been in place since the late 1940's. The box was decommissioned by [[BT Group|British Telecom]] in 2010. The telephone box was purchased by Willaston Parish Council and turned into a book exchange known as the book box. A restoration was carried out in September 2019.\n[[File:Willaston_Book_Box.jpg|thumb|Former K6 Telephone box converted into a book exchange box]]\n\n==Local events==\n[[File:Willaston - Worm Charming.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Worm Charming Championships]] have been held in Willaston since 1980.]]\nOne of the major events in Willaston is the [[World Worm Charming Championships]]. It was started in 1980 by John Bailey. The event attracts many competitors from around the world, from the U.S. to Australia. The original event in 1980 was won with a total of 511 worms by Tom Shufflebotham - a record that stood until 2009.\n\nCelebrities that have taken part in the championships include [[Ben Fogle]] and [[Bob Carolgees]].

During his youth he attended [[Camp Kinderland]], the left-wing Yiddish youth camp. He joined the [[Communist Party USA]] in the 1930s and left it after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939. \n\n===Early career===\nDassin started as an actor with the ARTEF (''[[Yiddish theatre|Yiddish Proletarian Theater]]'') company in New York. He collaborated on a film with [[Jack Skurnick]] that was uncompleted because of Skurnick's early death.\n\nIn 1940 he moved to Hollywood and became an assistant director at [[RKO Pictures]] before moving to [[MGM]] where he made short films including ''[[The Tell-Tale Heart (1941 film)|The Tell-Tale Heart]]'' (1941) which led to him being promoted to direct feature films.<ref>{{cite book | last = Katz | first = Ephraim | title = The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-333-74037-8 |oclc=39216574 |edition=3rd |page=333}}</ref>\n\nDassin quickly became better known for his [[film noir|noir films]] ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947), ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), and ''[[Thieves' Highway]]'' (1949), which helped him to become regarded as \"one of the leading American filmmakers of the postwar era.\"<ref name=\"Luther\">{{cite news|last=Luther|first=Claudia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/01/local/me-dassin1|title=Noir master directed caper classic 'Rififi'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Hollywood Blacklist===\n{{Main|Hollywood Blacklist}}\nDassin said [[Darryl F.

In 1952, after Dassin had been out of work for two years, actress [[Bette Davis]] hired him to direct her in the Broadway revue ''[[Two's Company (musical)|Two's Company]]''. The show closed early, however, and Dassin left for Europe. \n\n===Move to Europe===\nDassin did not work as a film director again until ''[[Rififi]]'' in 1955 (a French production), his most influential film and an early work in the [[heist film|\"heist film\" genre]].  He won the Best Director award for the film at the 1955 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIt inspired later heist films, such as ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"Luther\"/> Another film it  inspired was Dassin's own heist film ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' (1964), filmed in France and [[Istanbul, Turkey]] with his future second wife, [[Melina Mercouri]] and Oscar winner [[Peter Ustinov]].\n\nMost of Dassin's films in the decades following the blacklist are European productions.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> His prolific later career in Europe and the affiliation with Greece through his second wife, combined with a common pronunciation of his surname as \"Da-SAN\" in Europe, as opposed to \"DASS-in\" in the United States leads to a common misconception that he was a European director.<ref name=\"dassin_interview\"/>\n\n===Melina Mercouri===\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955 he met Melina Mercouri, Greek actress and wife of Panos Harokopos.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> At about the same time, he discovered the literary works of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]; these two elements created a bond with Greece.

He joined the [[Communist Party USA]] in the 1930s and left it after the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] in 1939. \n\n===Early career===\nDassin started as an actor with the ARTEF (''[[Yiddish theatre|Yiddish Proletarian Theater]]'') company in New York. He collaborated on a film with [[Jack Skurnick]] that was uncompleted because of Skurnick's early death.\n\nIn 1940 he moved to Hollywood and became an assistant director at [[RKO Pictures]] before moving to [[MGM]] where he made short films including ''[[The Tell-Tale Heart (1941 film)|The Tell-Tale Heart]]'' (1941) which led to him being promoted to direct feature films.<ref>{{cite book | last = Katz | first = Ephraim | title = The Macmillan International Film Encyclopedia | publisher = Macmillan | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-333-74037-8 |oclc=39216574 |edition=3rd |page=333}}</ref>\n\nDassin quickly became better known for his [[film noir|noir films]] ''[[Brute Force (1947 film)|Brute Force]]'' (1947), ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), and ''[[Thieves' Highway]]'' (1949), which helped him to become regarded as \"one of the leading American filmmakers of the postwar era.\"<ref name=\"Luther\">{{cite news|last=Luther|first=Claudia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/01/local/me-dassin1|title=Noir master directed caper classic 'Rififi'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 1, 2008|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Hollywood Blacklist===\n{{Main|Hollywood Blacklist}}\nDassin said [[Darryl F.

In 1952, after Dassin had been out of work for two years, actress [[Bette Davis]] hired him to direct her in the Broadway revue ''[[Two's Company (musical)|Two's Company]]''. The show closed early, however, and Dassin left for Europe. \n\n===Move to Europe===\nDassin did not work as a film director again until ''[[Rififi]]'' in 1955 (a French production), his most influential film and an early work in the [[heist film|\"heist film\" genre]].  He won the Best Director award for the film at the 1955 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIt inspired later heist films, such as ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (1960).<ref name=\"Luther\"/> Another film it  inspired was Dassin's own heist film ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'' (1964), filmed in France and [[Istanbul, Turkey]] with his future second wife, [[Melina Mercouri]] and Oscar winner [[Peter Ustinov]].\n\nMost of Dassin's films in the decades following the blacklist are European productions.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> His prolific later career in Europe and the affiliation with Greece through his second wife, combined with a common pronunciation of his surname as \"Da-SAN\" in Europe, as opposed to \"DASS-in\" in the United States leads to a common misconception that he was a European director.<ref name=\"dassin_interview\"/>\n\n===Melina Mercouri===\nAt the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955 he met Melina Mercouri, Greek actress and wife of Panos Harokopos.<ref name=\"Luther\"/> At about the same time, he discovered the literary works of [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]; these two elements created a bond with Greece. Dassin next made ''[[He Who Must Die]]'' (1957) based on Kazantzakis' ''[[Christ Recrucified]]'' and in which Mercouri appeared.

Along with Mercouri, he opposed the [[Greek military junta]]. \n\nThe couple had to leave Greece after the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|colonels' coup]] in 1967. In 1970 they were accused of having financed an attempt to overthrow the dictatorship, but the charges were quickly dropped.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Dassin and Mercouri lived in New York City during the 1970s; then, when the military dictatorship in Greece fell in 1974, they returned to Greece and lived out their lives there. In 1974 he and Mercouri made ''[[The Rehearsal (1974 film)|The Rehearsal]]'' about the junta. \n\nWhile Mercouri became involved with politics and won a parliamentary seat, Dassin stayed with movie-making in Europe.
