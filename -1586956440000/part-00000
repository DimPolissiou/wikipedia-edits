K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|1998 novel of the same name]]. The film is a sequel to the 2001 film ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' and the second instal<!--This is spelled with one \"l\" in British English-->ment in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. It was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[David Heyman]].\n\nThe film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (Character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]] and is also the last film to feature [[Richard Harris]] as Professor Albus Dumbledore, due to his death that same year. Its story follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as the Heir of [[Hogwarts staff#Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] opens the [[Hogwarts#Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], unleashing a monster that [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifies]] the school's denizens.\n\nThe film was released in theatres in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 November 2002. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $879 million at the box office worldwide. It was the [[2002 in film|second highest-grossing film of 2002]] behind ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. The movie was nominated for many awards including the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Award]] for [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound|Best Sound]], and [[BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects|Best Special Visual Effects]]. It was followed by six sequels, beginning with ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ending with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2]]'' in 2011, nearly ten years after the first film's release.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. This article also uses British English, so be sure to see WP:ENGVAR before inverting certain grammar, like \"defence\" for example. -->\n[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] spends the summer with [[The Dursleys]] without receiving letters from his [[Hogwarts]] friends. In his room, Harry meets [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]], a [[house-elf]] who warns him of a peril that will take shape if he returns to Hogwarts. Dobby reveals that he intercepted his friends' letters, and destroys a cake in order to prevent his return to school. The Dursleys lock Harry up, but [[Ron Weasley]] and his older twin brothers, [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], rescue him in their father's flying [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nWhile purchasing school supplies, Harry and the Weasley family encounter [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. They attend a book-signing by celebrity wizard [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who announces that he will be the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. During a small confrontation with [[Draco Malfoy]], Harry meets Malfoy's father, [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], who discreetly slips a book into [[Ginny Weasley]]'s belongings, which only Harry notices, but he mentions this to no one. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] at [[London King's Cross railway station]], they fly to Hogwarts in the flying car. They crash into the [[Whomping Willow]] upon arrival, and Ron's wand is broken. Both boys narrowly avoid [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]] when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gives them detention.\n\nDuring the detention, Harry hears strange voices and later finds caretaker [[Argus Filch]]'s cat, Mrs. Norris, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]], along with a message written in blood announcing \"the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware\". McGonagall explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, [[Salazar Slytherin]], supposedly constructed a secret Chamber. He placed a monster inside that only his Heir can control, capable of purging the school of muggle-born students. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy as the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using the forbidden [[polyjuice potion]]. They utilise a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, [[Moaning Myrtle]], as their makeshift laboratory to brew the potion.\n\nDuring a Quidditch game, Harry's arm is broken by a Bludger and then he is visited by Dobby in the infirmary and he tells Harry that he was the one who closed the portal to Platform 9 3/4 and he was also the one who made the Bludger chase after Harry, in an attempt to get Harry to leave the school. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the Heir. On Christmas Day, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but Malfoy mentions his father told him that a muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former Hogwarts student [[Lord Voldemort|Tom Riddle]], which contains a flashback fifty years prior where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], and Lucius come to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]], but he discreetly tells the boys to \"follow the spiders\". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider, [[Aragog]], who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides them a small clue about the Chamber's monster.\n\nA book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], a giant serpent that instantly kills those that make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they take him to the bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's broken wand against them, but it backfires, wipes his memory, and causes a cave-in.\n\nHarry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. When Riddle creates the anagram for his future new identity, \"I am Lord Voldemort\", Harry realises that Riddle himself is [[Slytherin]]'s heir and Voldemort's true identity. After Harry expresses support for Dumbledore, [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]] flies in with the [[Sorting Hat]], causing Riddle to summon the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, allowing Harry to look at it directly without being killed or petrified. The Sorting Hat eventually produces the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, though he is injured by one of its fangs.\n\nHarry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with the basilisk fang. Fawkes's tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore praises them and orders Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry the sword he wielded was [[Godric Gryffindor]]'s own sword, and says he is different from Voldemort because he chose [[Gryffindor]] instead of Slytherin. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Lockhart is seen in a [[straitjacket]], having published a new book, titled ''Who Am I?''\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Harry Potter films cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a 12-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of the evil wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] as an infant, who now enters his second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], Harry's best male friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's best female friend.\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], a celebrity author and the new [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts.

K. Rowling]]'s [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|1998 novel of the same name]]. The film is a sequel to the 2001 film ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' and the second instal<!--This is spelled with one \"l\" in British English-->ment in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. It was written by [[Steve Kloves]] and produced by [[David Heyman]].\n\nThe film stars [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (Character)|Harry Potter]], with [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], and [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]] and is also the last film to feature [[Richard Harris]] as Professor Albus Dumbledore, due to his death that same year. Its story follows [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as the Heir of [[Hogwarts staff#Salazar Slytherin|Salazar Slytherin]] opens the [[Hogwarts#Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]], unleashing a monster that [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrifies]] the school's denizens.\n\nThe film was released in theatres in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 November 2002. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $879 million at the box office worldwide.

This article also uses British English, so be sure to see WP:ENGVAR before inverting certain grammar, like \"defence\" for example. -->\n[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] spends the summer with [[The Dursleys]] without receiving letters from his [[Hogwarts]] friends. In his room, Harry meets [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Dobby|Dobby]], a [[house-elf]] who warns him of a peril that will take shape if he returns to Hogwarts. Dobby reveals that he intercepted his friends' letters, and destroys a cake in order to prevent his return to school. The Dursleys lock Harry up, but [[Ron Weasley]] and his older twin brothers, [[Fred and George Weasley|Fred and George]], rescue him in their father's flying [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nWhile purchasing school supplies, Harry and the Weasley family encounter [[Rubeus Hagrid]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. They attend a book-signing by celebrity wizard [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], who announces that he will be the new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher. During a small confrontation with [[Draco Malfoy]], Harry meets Malfoy's father, [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]], who discreetly slips a book into [[Ginny Weasley]]'s belongings, which only Harry notices, but he mentions this to no one. When Harry and Ron are blocked from entering [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] at [[London King's Cross|King's Cross]], they fly to Hogwarts in the flying car. They crash into the [[Whomping Willow]] upon arrival, and Ron's wand is broken. Both boys narrowly avoid [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]] when [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] gives them detention.\n\nDuring the detention, Harry hears strange voices and later finds caretaker [[Argus Filch]]'s cat, Mrs. Norris, [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|petrified]], along with a message written in blood announcing \"the Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware\". McGonagall explains that one of Hogwarts' founders, [[Salazar Slytherin]], supposedly constructed a secret Chamber. He placed a monster inside that only his Heir can control, capable of purging the school of muggle-born students. Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy as the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using the forbidden [[polyjuice potion]]. They utilise a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, [[Moaning Myrtle]], as their makeshift laboratory to brew the potion.\n\nDuring a Quidditch game, Harry's arm is broken by a Bludger and then he is visited by Dobby in the infirmary and he tells Harry that he was the one who closed the portal to Platform 9 3/4 and he was also the one who made the Bludger chase after Harry, in an attempt to get Harry to leave the school. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the Heir. On Christmas Day, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but Malfoy mentions his father told him that a muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former Hogwarts student [[Lord Voldemort|Tom Riddle]], which contains a flashback fifty years prior where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]], [[Cornelius Fudge]], and Lucius come to take Hagrid to [[Azkaban]], but he discreetly tells the boys to \"follow the spiders\". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider, [[Aragog]], who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides them a small clue about the Chamber's monster.\n\nA book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]], a giant serpent that instantly kills those that make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they take him to the bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's broken wand against them, but it backfires, wipes his memory, and causes a cave-in.\n\nHarry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. When Riddle creates the anagram for his future new identity, \"I am Lord Voldemort\", Harry realises that Riddle himself is [[Slytherin]]'s heir and Voldemort's true identity. After Harry expresses support for Dumbledore, [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)#Fawkes|Fawkes]] flies in with the [[Sorting Hat]], causing Riddle to summon the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, allowing Harry to look at it directly without being killed or petrified. The Sorting Hat eventually produces the [[Sword of Gryffindor]], with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, though he is injured by one of its fangs.\n\nHarry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with the basilisk fang. Fawkes's tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore praises them and orders Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry the sword he wielded was [[Godric Gryffindor]]'s own sword, and says he is different from Voldemort because he chose [[Gryffindor]] instead of Slytherin. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Lockhart is seen in a [[straitjacket]], having published a new book, titled ''Who Am I?''\n\n==Cast==\n{{Further|List of Harry Potter films cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], a 12-year-old British [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] famous for surviving his parents' murder at the hands of the evil wizard [[Lord Voldemort]] as an infant, who now enters his second year at [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], Harry's best male friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's best female friend.\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], a celebrity author and the new [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher at Hogwarts.

The original registration was under the name ''Teva Middle East Pharmaceutical & Chemical Works Co. Ltd.'' in Jerusalem.  Friedl\u00e4nder was a German pharmacist, botanist and pharmacognos, who immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1934, following the [[Nazi Party]] Rise to power.\n\nThe company was built with an investment of 4,900 [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]], which came from the family's own [[private capital|capital]] and partly from loans from other German immigrants. Capital shortage led to the joining of the banker [[Alfred Feuchtwanger]] as a partner in Teva, who received 33% of the shares in return for his investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tbbQvksgxwC&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417&dq=Dr.+Alfred+Feuchtwanger&source=bl&ots=85JCkY_f2W&sig=IubbmcDOSIPdyZQiJBxjraml17U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRxqCx-aXRAhUGSRoKHQFNBsMQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=Dr.+Alfred+Feuchtwanger&f=false|title=Die Feuchtwangers: Familie, Tradition und j\u00fcdisches Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis|first=Heike|last=Specht|date=October 24, 2013|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|accessdate=February 21, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> In 1951, Feuchtwanger initiated an [[initial public offering]] to raise capital through the newly founded [[Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange]], and Teva became a [[public company]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFriedl\u00e4nder's business philosophy opined that the pharmaceutical industry has a reliable basis in difficult economic times, since \"A Jewish mother will always buy medicine for her children\". In the [[Second World War]], the company provided medicine to the allied forces and in particular to the [[British army]] present in the [[Middle East]]. After the war, Sir [[Alan Gordon Cunningham]], the last of the [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan]], visited Teva on behalf of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. His visit promoted Teva's reputation in the pharmaceutical market and created a momentum for Teva's development.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] and until the termination of the British [[Mandatory Palestine]] regime, Teva exported its medical products to Arab countries. In 1941, Friedl\u00e4nder presented Teva products in an [[exhibition]] held in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].\nThe exhibition was sponsored by the General Agent and Sole Distribution of [[medicine]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Later on, Teva exported its products to the [[US]], [[Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]), health institutes in [[Denmark]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Persia]] and [[Burma]].\n\nIn 1959, the Pharmaceutical branch of the Israeli Manufacturer's Association performed a [[survey methodology|survey]] grading the pharmaceutical companies in Israel according to several measures. Teva Pharmaceuticals of Jerusalem was graded in the first place.  In 1954, Teva received a Certificate Excellence in Training award from the Israeli President, [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]]. Friedl\u00e4nder emphasized the importance of education and training of Teva personnel for the various operations, as demanded by the pharmaceutical industry, as well as on achieving broader knowledge and participation in various courses held outside the company. In 1964, a partnership between Teva and other companies was developed.

Capital shortage led to the joining of the banker [[Alfred Feuchtwanger]] as a partner in Teva, who received 33% of the shares in return for his investment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tbbQvksgxwC&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417&dq=Dr.+Alfred+Feuchtwanger&source=bl&ots=85JCkY_f2W&sig=IubbmcDOSIPdyZQiJBxjraml17U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRxqCx-aXRAhUGSRoKHQFNBsMQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&q=Dr.+Alfred+Feuchtwanger&f=false|title=Die Feuchtwangers: Familie, Tradition und j\u00fcdisches Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis|first=Heike|last=Specht|date=October 24, 2013|publisher=Wallstein Verlag|accessdate=February 21, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> In 1951, Feuchtwanger initiated an [[initial public offering]] to raise capital through the newly founded [[Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange]], and Teva became a [[public company]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nFriedl\u00e4nder's business philosophy opined that the pharmaceutical industry has a reliable basis in difficult economic times, since \"A Jewish mother will always buy medicine for her children\". In the [[Second World War]], the company provided medicine to the allied forces and in particular to the [[British army]] present in the [[Middle East]]. After the war, Sir [[Alan Gordon Cunningham]], the last of the [[High Commissioners for Palestine and Transjordan]], visited Teva on behalf of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]]. His visit promoted Teva's reputation in the pharmaceutical market and created a momentum for Teva's development.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] and until the termination of the British [[Mandatory Palestine]] regime, Teva exported its medical products to Arab countries. In 1941, Friedl\u00e4nder presented Teva products in an [[exhibition]] held in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].\nThe exhibition was sponsored by the General Agent and Sole Distribution of [[medicine]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]. Later on, Teva exported its products to the [[US]], [[Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]), health institutes in [[Denmark]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Persia]] and [[Burma]].\n\nIn 1959, the Pharmaceutical branch of the Israeli Manufacturer's Association performed a [[survey methodology|survey]] grading the pharmaceutical companies in Israel according to several measures. Teva Pharmaceuticals of Jerusalem was graded in the first place.  In 1954, Teva received a Certificate Excellence in Training award from the Israeli President, [[Yitzhak Ben Zvi]]. Friedl\u00e4nder emphasized the importance of education and training of Teva personnel for the various operations, as demanded by the pharmaceutical industry, as well as on achieving broader knowledge and participation in various courses held outside the company. In 1964, a partnership between Teva and other companies was developed. These included Sintex, a company from Mexico, [[Schering Plough]] and others.\n\n===Merger of Assia, Zori and Teva===\nIn 1964, Assia and Zori merged and in 1968 acquired a controlling stake in Teva.

It was founded in 1924 by [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] and originally produced general purpose clothing. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in the 1930s, Boss began to produce and sell Nazi uniforms. Boss would eventually supply the wartime German government with uniforms for organizations such as the [[Hitler Youth]] and [[Waffen-SS]], resulting in a large boost in sales. \n\nAfter [[World War II]] and the founder's death in 1948, Hugo Boss started to turn its focus from uniforms to men's suits. The company went public in 1988 and introduced a fragrance line that same year, added men's and women's wear diffusion lines in 1997, a full women's collection in 2000, as well as children's clothing in 2006\u20132007 and has since evolved into a major global fashion house. {{As of|2018||df=}} it owned more than 1,113 retail stores worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/294103/number-of-hugo-boss-stores-worldwide/|title=Number of Hugo Boss stores worldwide 2009-2018|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Boss 1933 adv.jpg|thumb|1933 ad placed by Hugo Boss for Nazi uniforms, work, sports and rainwear]]\nIn 1923, [[Hugo Boss (fashion designer)|Hugo Boss]] founded his own clothing company in [[Metzingen]], Germany, where it is still based.<ref name=NYT>{{cite newspaper|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/12/business/worldbusiness/a-small-town-in-germany-fits-hugo-boss-nicely.html|author=Landler, Mark|title=A Small Town in Germany Fits Hugo Boss Nicely|date=April 12, 2005|page=C00001\n}}</ref> In 1924, he started a factory along with two partners.
