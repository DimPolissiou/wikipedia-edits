It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]], and the team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007). As a result, ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was rushed so it could release in time for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris.

It was produced in commemoration of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog|''Sonic'' series]]' 15th anniversary, and intended as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] for the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation video game consoles]]. Players control [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Shadow the Hedgehog|Shadow]], and new character [[Silver the Hedgehog|Silver]], who battle Solaris, an ancient evil pursued by [[Doctor Eggman]]. Each playable character has his own campaign and abilities, and must complete [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s, explore [[Hub level system|hub worlds]] and fight [[boss (video gaming)|bosses]] to advance the story. In [[multiplayer]] modes, players can work cooperatively to collect [[Chaos Emeralds]] or race to the end of a level.\n\nDevelopment began in 2004, led by ''Sonic'' co-creator [[Yuji Naka]]. Sonic Team sought to create an appealing game in the vein of [[superhero film]]s like ''[[Batman Begins]]'', hoping it would advance the series with a realistic tone and multiple gameplay styles. Problems developed after Naka resigned to form his own company, [[Prope]], and the team split to work on the [[Wii]] game ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'' (2007). As a result, ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was rushed so it could release in time for the [[holiday season]]. It was released for [[Xbox 360]] in November 2006 and for [[PlayStation 3]] the following month. Versions for Wii and [[Windows]] were canceled. [[Downloadable content]] featuring new [[single-player]] modes was released in 2007.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' received praise in prerelease showings, as journalists believed it could return to the series' roots after years of mixed reviews. However, it was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|a critical failure]]. Reviewers criticized its loading times, camera system, story, stability, and controls. It has been frequently described as the worst game in the series. In 2010, Sega delisted ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' from retailers, following its decision to remove all ''Sonic'' games with below-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand. Its failure led to a rethinking of the series' direction; future games ignored its tone and most characters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic 06 gameplay.jpg|left|thumbnail|alt=Screenshot of Wave Ocean, the first level of Sonic's campaign in Sonic the Hedgehog; this particular screen shows Sonic running at full speed while dodging obstacles.

Thank you. -->\n[[Doctor Eggman]] kidnaps Princess Elise of Soleanna in the hopes of harnessing the Flames of Disaster, a destructive power sealed within her. Aided by his friends Tails and Knuckles, Sonic works to protect Elise from Eggman. Meanwhile, Shadow and his fellow agent Rouge accidentally release an evil spirit, Mephiles. The spirit transports them to a [[post-apocalyptic]] future ravaged by a demonic monster, Iblis. When Mephiles meets survivors Silver and Blaze, he fools them into thinking Sonic is the cause of this destruction and sends them to the present to kill him.\n\nThroughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. Though at first Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his attempts to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is not the cause of his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, who is trying to change the past for his own evil purposes. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, who was sealed within Elise as a child, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles eventually succeeds after killing Sonic to make Elise cry over his death, releasing her seal on Iblis and merging with him to become Solaris, who then attempts to consume time itself. The heroes use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to revive Sonic, and he, Shadow, and Silver transform into their [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Super transformation|super forms]] to defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise are brought to the past and extinguish Solaris's flame, removing the god from existence and preventing the previous events from ever occurring.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Elise:''' This is where everything began.

Because the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] vests all military authority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the president, the statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the Secretary of Defense, and the secretary's subordinate officials generally, exercise military authority.\n\nThe Department of Defense is composed of the Office of the Secretary of Defense ([[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]]), the Joint Chiefs of Staff ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]) and the Joint Staff ([[Joint Staff|JS]]), Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|DODIG]]), the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], the Military Departments ([[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] (DA), [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DON) & [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] (DAF)), the [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field Activities]], the [[National Guard Bureau]] (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the Secretary of Defense.\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the department, and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the department.

Because the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] vests all military authority in [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the president, the statutory authority of the Secretary of Defense is derived from their constitutional authorities. Since it is impractical for either Congress or the president to participate in every piece of Department of Defense affairs, the Secretary of Defense, and the secretary's subordinate officials generally, exercise military authority.\n\nThe Department of Defense is composed of the Office of the Secretary of Defense ([[Office of the Secretary of Defense|OSD]]), the Joint Chiefs of Staff ([[Joint Chiefs of Staff|JCS]]) and the Joint Staff ([[Joint Staff|JS]]), Office of the Inspector General ([[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|DODIG]]), the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], the Military Departments ([[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] (DA), [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] (DON) & [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] (DAF)), the [[List of Department of Defense agencies|Defense Agencies and Department of Defense Field Activities]], the [[National Guard Bureau]] (NGB), and such other offices, agencies, activities, organizations, and commands established or designated by law, or by the president or by the Secretary of Defense.\n\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5100.01 describes the organizational relationships within the department, and is the foundational issuance for delineating the major functions of the department.
