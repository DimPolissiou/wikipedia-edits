Defection by legislators is faced by many other political democracies around the world. Such acts by legislators invite political instability by way of abandonment of one's parent party for various reasons. In most of the democracies, the stability of the government is dependent on the support from Legislators or a coalition of different parties. Such acts of political defection resulting in instability of the sitting government is looked at, as a betrayal of ''Peoples Mandate''. Many countries have adopted different means to tackle the menace of political defections, some through conventions and other by way of Laws. In India, there were several instances, when political instability was inflicted on the people of India, both at the center and states because of political defection by various legislators by splitting the political parties. It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, Almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref> There rose a need to this malice of political defections. It was in the backdrop of such regular precedents, a law was sought to curb defections by legislators. In 1985, by way of introducing '''''Tenth schedule'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S10.pdf|title=Tenth Schedule|last=|first=|date=1985|website=Govt. of India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the 52nd amendment to the [[Constitution of India]], both [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] passed The Anti-defection law. Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=G C.|title=Anti-defection Law in India and The Commonwealth|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Forword}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy. Elections in a democratic country are an important aspect where people cast their ballot and determine which political party shall govern the country or a state. In such scenarios, Political defections poses a major threat to the will of the people.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=G C.|title=Anti-defection Law in India and in The Commonwealth|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}</ref> Political defections were as common in India, even common during pre-independence India. But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India. The term ''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram'', was popularized when in 1967, a legislator by name [[Gaya Lal]] changed his allegiance to three different parties in a single day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/anti-defection-law-explained|title=The Anti-Defection Law Explained|last=Relhan|first=Vibhor|date=December 2017|website=PRS Legislative Research|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1957 and 67, it is estimated that, because of a stronghold over power by [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]] party, it emerged as a sole beneficiary of the defections by losing 98 of its legislators and gaining 419. However, defections from other political parties did not join other political parties, instead they formed a separate political party intending to share power.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kashyap|first=Subhash|date=March 1970|title=The Politics of Defection: The Changing Contours of the Political Power Structure in State Politics in India|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2642574?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Asian Survey|volume=Vol.10 No.3|pages=197|via=JSTOR}}</ref> In 1967 elections, approximately 3,500 members were elected to various legislative assemblies and of union territories of them around 550 changed their parent parties by defections.

There was a definite trend in the political landscape of India during the 1970-80s. Whenever there was a Congress-led Government at the center, the regional governments fell like a pack of cards because of the defection of non-Congress elected representatives. The then chief minister of [[Karnataka]], [[Virendra Patil]] called it as \"Goldrush\".

Defection from by legislators is faced by many other political democracies around the world. Such acts by legislators invite political instability by way of abandonment of one's parent party for various reasons. In most of the democracies, the stability of the government is dependent on the support from Legislators or a coalition of different parties. Such acts of political defection resulting in instability of the sitting government is termed as a betrayal of ''Peoples Mandate''. Many countries have adopted different means to tackle the menace of political defections, some through conventions and other byways of Laws. In India, there were several instances, when political instability was inflicted on the people of India, both at the center and states because of political defection by various legislators by splitting the political parties. It was estimated during fourth and fifth general elections, out of 4000 legislators for the parliament and other state and union territories, Almost 50 percent of the members defected causing political turmoil in India.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkatesh Kumar|first=|date=May 2003|title=Anti-defection Law: Welcome Reforms|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4413541?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=Vol.38 No.19|pages=1837|via=JSTOR}}</ref> There rose a need to this malice of political defections. It was in the backdrop of such regular precedents, a law was sought to curb defections by legislators. In 1985, by way of introducing '''''Tenth schedule'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/pdf1/S10.pdf|title=Tenth Schedule|last=|first=|date=1985|website=Govt. of India|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in the 52nd amendment to the [[Constitution of India]], both [[Lok Sabha]] and [[Rajya Sabha]] passed The Anti-defection Act. Further, to address various lacunae in the said act, many constitutional bodies recommended reviewing the law. [[Parliament of India]], in 2003 passed Ninety-first amendment to the Constitution of India strengthening the act by inserting provisions to disqualify the defecting members and barring them to be appointed as ministers for the period of up to the original tenure and disqualifying members, defecting from splits caused by one-third of members moving out of a political party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malhotra|first=G C.|title=Anti-defection Law in India and The Commonwealth|publisher=|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=Forword}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n\u201cGovernment is of the people by the people and for the people\", this is how [[Abraham Lincoln]] defined the Democracy.

But ever since 1960, especially, the states added a new facet to the political instability in the country resulting from coalition politics in India. The term ''Aaya Ram Gaya Ram'', was popularized when in 1967, a legislator by name [[Gaya Lal]] changed his allegiance to three different parties in a single day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/anti-defection-law-explained|title=The Anti-Defection Law Explained|last=Relhan|first=Vibhor|date=December 2017|website=PRS Legislative Research|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9April 2020}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1957 and 67, it is estimated that, because of a stronghold over power by [[Indian National Congress|Congress (I)]] party, it emerged as a sole beneficiary of the defections by losing 98 of its legislators and gaining 419.

After contacting Yacovelli, Luparelli said he recruited Colombo associates Philip Gambino, Carmine DiBiase and two other men {{ndash}} reputedly members of the Patriarca family {{ndash}} to kill Gallo due to their belief the Colombo family had a contract on Gallo's life. On reaching Umberto's, Luparelli said he stayed in the car and the other four men went inside through the back door.<ref name=\"story murder\" /> Between seafood courses, Luparelli asserted the four gunmen burst into the dining room and opened fire with [[.32 caliber|.32-]] and [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]]s. Gallo swore and drew his handgun. Twenty shots were fired and Gallo was hit in the back, elbow and buttock. After overturning a [[butcher block]] dining table, Gallo staggered to the front door.

Umberto's was owned by Genovese Mafia associates, which would normally imply the Genovese family had given their blessing to a killing on their territory.

After contacting Yacovelli, Luparelli said he recruited Colombo associates Philip Gambino, Carmine DiBiase and two other men {{ndash}} reputedly members of the Patriarca family {{ndash}} to kill Gallo due to their belief the Colombo family had a contract on Gallo's life. On reaching Umberto's, Luparelli said he stayed in the car and the other four men went inside through the back door.<ref name=\"story murder\" /> Between seafood courses, Luparelli asserted the four gunmen burst into the dining room and opened fire with [[.32 caliber|.32-]] and [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]]s. Gallo swore and drew his handgun. Twenty shots were fired and Gallo was hit in the back, elbow and buttock. After overturning a [[butcher block]] dining table, Gallo staggered to the front door.

Umberto's was owned by Genovese Mafia associates, which would normally imply the Genovese family had given their blessing to a killing on their territory.

It has stirred up heated responses from supporters of both sides in [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities with its implications of political ideology and cultural identity.<ref name=\"Keller\">Keller, Andr\u00e9e Tabouret. (1997). Vernacular Literacy: A Re-Evaluation. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-823635-2}}</ref>  Simplified characters here exclusively refer to those characters simplified by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), instead of the concept of character simplification as a whole. The effect of simplified characters on the language remains controversial, decades after their introduction.\n\n==Problems==\nThe sheer difficulties posed by having two concurrent writing systems hinders communications between mainland China and other regions, although with exposure and experience a person educated in one system can quickly become familiar with the other system.<ref name=\"rfd\"/> For those who know both systems well, converting an entire document written using simplified characters to traditional characters, or vice versa, is a trivial but laborious task. Automated conversion, however, from simplified to traditional is not straightforward because there is not always a one-to-one mapping of a simplified character to a traditional character. One simplified character may equate to many traditional characters. As a result, a computer can be used for the bulk of the conversion but will still need final checking by a human.<ref name=\"rfd\">{{Cite news|url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/chinese-language-ever-evolving/|title=The Chinese Language, Ever Evolving|first=Eileen|last=Chao|first2=Eugene|last2=Wang|first3=Meng|last3=Hsuan|first4=Norman|last4=Matloff|work=Room for Debate|publisher=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThe writer [[Ba Jin]], in his essay \"Thoughts: Reform of Chinese characters\" ({{zh|s=\u968f\u60f3\u5f55\u00b7\u6c49\u5b57\u6539\u9769|t=\u96a8\u60f3\u9304\u6f22\u5b57\u6539\u9769|p=Su\u00ed xi\u01ceng l\u00f9 h\u00e0nz\u00ec g\u01ceig\u00e9}}), urged caution in any reforms to the written Chinese language. He cited the inability of those educated in Hong Kong or Taiwan to read material published on the mainland, and vice versa, as a great disadvantage of simplified Chinese. He also cited the ability to communicate, not just with Chinese peoples of various regions, but also with people from across the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] \u2014 countries such as [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Vietnam]] \u2014 as a great advantage of the written Chinese language that should not be undermined by excessive simplification.<ref>Ba Jin.

Beijing.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Simplified characters===\nProponents say that the Chinese writing system has been changing for millennia: it passed through the [[Oracle Script]], [[Bronzeware Script]], [[Seal Script]] and [[Clerical Script]] stages. Moreover, the majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms that have been used in handwriting for centuries<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=S. Robert|title=The Languages of China|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01468-5|page=147}}</ref> such as the use of \u793c instead of \u79ae,<ref name=\"Norman_p81\">{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist)|title=Chinese|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|page=81|isbn=978-0-521-29653-3}}</ref> and some simplified characters are in fact restorations of ancient forms that had become more complicated over time. For instance, the character for \"cloud\" was originally \u4e91 in early inscriptions , but the character was borrowed to write a [[homophone|homophonous]] word meaning \"to say\". To disambiguate the two uses of the character, the \"rain\" radical ([[Radical 173|\u96e8]]) was added on top when it meant \"cloud\", forming the current traditional character \u96f2. The homophonous word meaning \"to say\", however, has become archaic in modern Chinese, though \u96f2 continues to be used for \"cloud\". The simplified version simply restores \u4e91 to its original use as \"cloud\".<ref name=\"Norman_p81\" />\n\n===Traditional characters===\nWhile some simplified characters were adopted from conventional abbreviated forms that have existed for a long time, those advocating the simplified forms often fail to point out that many such characters in fact had multiple vernacular forms out of which just one was chosen, arbitrarily, and then privileged by the designers of the simplified character scheme. Many of the changes can be seen as ideological, such as the removal of the \"heart\" (\u5fc3) from the word \"love\" (\u611b) into the new character (\u7231) without heart.

They have alleged that simplified characters were arbitrarily schematized and then imposed by the PRC on its people with the intention of subverting and eradicating selected elements of traditional Chinese culture, in order to carry out what the PRC viewed as necessary revolutionary modernization. These critics point out that many of the fundamental characteristics underlying Chinese characters, including [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] as well as etymological and phonetic elements, were deliberately omitted in their simplified form at least partly for this reason (i.e. disrupting continuity with traditional Chinese culture). One frequently-cited example is the character for \"sage\" or \"holy\", \u5723 in simplified and \u8056 in traditional. The simplified character lacks the ''king'' radical ([[Radical 96|\u738b]]), replacing it with ''soil'' ([[Radical 32|\u571f]]). Supporters of simplification appeal to the fact that that \u5723 was often used, in handwriting, as a simplified variant of \u8056 long before the PRC itself came into being.<ref name=\"Karlgren_1205\" />  The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' furthermore classifies \u8056 as a ''xingsheng'' character with phonetic component \u5448.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/21/sw/8056.htm|title=Shuowen Jiezi \"\u8056\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Zdic.net|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>  Thus the origin of the character may have nothing to do with any cultural connection to kings or royalty.\n\nEven among supporters of simplification, some make the argument that Classical Chinese texts should not be printed in simplified Chinese because of the complexities involved in the use of ''tongjia'' (\u901a\u5047) or phonetic loan characters.  Ancient texts for instance might use the character \u5973 (''n\u01da'', \"women\") when the character \u6c5d (''r\u01d4'', \"thou\") is intended semantically because of their similar pronunciation in [[Old Chinese]].  The interpretation of ancient texts in often complicated by the presence of these phonetic loans, for which several very different meanings could be read.  Generally, the more ancient the text, the more numerous the phonetic loans, since separate characters were slowly introduced as the written language evolved, in order to disambiguate these loans.  For instance, the preclassical ''Book of Odes'' and the early classical ''Analects'' always uses \u5973 for \u6c5d, while texts from the Han dynasty or later nearly always use \u6c5d.<ref>Ironically, \u6c5d itself is also a phonetic loan, the original meaning being the name of a river.  This meaning is, of course, rarely used, compared to the character's use as the second-person pronoun.</ref>  \n\nThe merging of several traditional characters into one simplified character (e.g., \u9858 (''yu\u00e0n'', \"desire\", commonly used) and \u613f (''yu\u00e0n'', \"honest\", archaic and rare) to \u613f (both meanings) during the simplification process can be thought of as the modern introduction of phonetic loans.  This complicates an already complex landscape of ''tongjia'' characters appearing in classical texts, introducing additional possibilities for misinterpretation, particularly for beginning students.  Personal names of historical individuals are also problematic.  For example, there are two [[Six Dynasties]] period generals whose names are \u738b\u6fec (206-286) and \u738b\u6d5a (252-314), both of which are pronounced as ''W\u00e1ng J\u00f9n''.  However, according to the current PRC simplification scheme, the character \u6fec is considered to be an obsolete variant of \u6d5a, so to conform to standard orthography, these names should be written identically using \u6d5a.  Against this argument, proponents of simplified characters respond that simplified characters are more practical in all domains other than ancient literature and that it is uneconomical to introduce high school students, already burdened by schoolwork, to a new character set for the sole purpose of teaching the classical language.  Any potentially confusing usages can be remedied by providing appropriate annotations and glosses in footnotes, which are needed anyway for student editions of classical texts.  When the need arises, history and language majors in colleges and universities gradually learn to read scholarly editions of texts set in traditional characters without too much difficulty.  Nevertheless, classical texts set in traditional Chinese can be hard to find in mainland Chinese bookstores.  The Zhonghua Publishing House (''Zhonghua Shuju'', \u4e2d\u83ef\u66f8\u5c40) and several other specialist scholastic publishers are the only ones to routinely publish works in traditional characters.\n\n==Literacy==\n\n===Arguments for simplified characters===\n*Proponents feel that simplified characters with fewer strokes make learning easier.<ref name=\"Gunde, Richard 2002\">Gunde, Richard.

[[Classical Chinese]] mainly used one character for one word, which made it commonplace for one character to have multiple meanings and multiple pronunciations. E.g. \"\u5929\" means \"sky\" (\u5929\u82cd\u82cd), \"heaven\" (\u5929\u5c06\u964d\u5927\u4efb), \"nature\" (\u6d51\u7136\u5929\u6210), \"weather\" (\u5fc3\u5fe7\u70ad\u8d31\u613f\u5929\u5bd2); \"\u957f\" means \"length\" (''ch\u00e1ng'', \u957f\u4e00\u8eab\u6709\u534a), \"specialty\" (''ch\u00e1ng'', \u4e00\u6280\u4e4b\u957f), \"grow\" (''zh\u01ceng'', \u8349\u6728\u9042\u957f), \"senior\" (''zh\u01ceng'', \u4ee5\u541b\u4e3a\u957f\u8005), e.t.c. Context is vital to determining the meaning of a certain character in Classical Chinese. After the early 1900s' [[Vernacular Chinese]] movement, compound words were formed by multiple characters (usually two), and these words usually have only one meaning: \"\u5929\u7a7a\" meaning \"sky\", \"\u4e0a\u5929\" meaning \"heaven\", \"\u5929\u7136\" meaning \"nature\", \"\u5929\u6c14\" meaning \"weather\", \"\u957f\u5ea6\" meaning \"length\", \"\u751f\u957f\" meaning \"grow\", e.t.c. Context is not necessary to determine the meaning of a certain word. Thus, the act of merging characters which forms homophones, does not create confusion when using Vernacular Chinese. E.g. \"\u5934\u53d1\" (\u982d\u9aee, ''f\u00e0'') meaning \"hair\", \"\u51fa\u53d1\" (\u51fa\u767c, ''f\u0101'') meaning \"set off\", \"\u8c37\u7269\" (\u7a40\u7269, ''g\u01d4'') meaning \"grain\", \"\u5c71\u8c37\" (''g\u01d4'') meaning \"hollow\". Hence, simplification reduces the number of characters one would need to learn for everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xys.org/fang/doc/history/jianhua2.txt|format=TXT |title=\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u4e71\u5417\uff1f |author=\u65b9\u821f\u5b50 |website=Xys.org |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Clarity of traditional characters===\n*Opponents cite a similar argument whereby the simplification of distinct characters caused them to be more difficult to discern apart. An example is \u7121 (''w\u00fa'') for \"none\", simplified into {{lang|zh-cn|\u65e0}}, which appears very similar to the character \u5929 (''ti\u0101n'') for \"sky\". Another example would be \u8a2d (''sh\u00e8'') for \"designate\", and \u6c92 (''m\u00e9i'') for \"without\", which are quite hard to distinguish apart in their simplified forms \u8bbe and {{lang|zh-cn|\u6ca1}} and can result in confusion in quick handwriting. This type of confusion has happened before for the characters \u8b80 (''d\u00fa'') for \"read\" and \u7006 (''d\u00fa'') for \"showing disrespect\" which were confused for each other in their simplified forms \u8bfb and \u6e0e respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/07/speak-mandarin-campaign-uses-wrong-chinese-character-for-the-word-read/|title=Speak Mandarin Campaign uses wrong Chinese character for the word \u2018Read\u2019|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> (Another example of the same kind is \u6d3b (''hu\u00f3'') \"to live\" and \u8a71 (''hu\u00e0'') \"talk,\" which in simplified are \u6d3b and \u8bdd and can be misinterpreted in rapid handwriting). \n*Similarly, some simplified characters create more confusion. In traditional writing, \u5343 (''qi\u0101n'') \"thousand\", and \u4e7e (''g\u0101n'') \"dry\" are very different characters.

Likewise, \u96bb (''zh\u012b'', a [[Chinese classifier|measure word]]) and \u53ea (''zh\u01d0'', \"only\") are merged into \u53ea; \u767c (''f\u0101'', \"happening\") and \u9aee (''f\u00e0'', \"hair\") are merged into \u53d1; \u9eb5 (''mi\u00e0n'', noodles/flour) and \u9762 (''mi\u00e0n'', face/side/surface) are merged into \u9762; \u7a40 (''g\u01d4'', \"crop\") and \u8c37 (g\u01d4, \"valley\") are merged into \u8c37, and so on.\n*On 3 September 1993, the Board of Language Usage & Applications of China permitted and re-introduced the usage of the character \u2018\u9394\u2019 and released a new policy of ''Resolution for the Complication in Using Character \u2018\u9394\u2019 and Its Usage Re-introduction'' (\u300a\u5173\u4e8e\"\u9394\"\u5b57\u4f7f\u7528\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6279\u590d\u300b).  The movement was an attempt in trying to resolve the controversy caused by the conflict between the lawful mergers of characters of \u2018\u9394\u2019and \u2018\u7194\u2019 and the name usage of former Vice Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]. According to earlier Chinese laws regarding Chinese Language Simplification, character \u2018\u9394\u2019 should have always been written as \u2018\u7194\u2019; however, Zhu Rongji insisted on writing \u2018\u9394\u2019 when it came down to writing his name because he was originally named in the character \u2018\u9394\u2019but not \u2018\u7194\u2019. Thus, the Board later re-introduced the character. Proponents of traditional characters thus argue against the use of simplified chinese, especially when it comes down to mergers of characters in names of historical heroes, scholars, philosophers, and political figures. They also report trouble in flight reservations when traveling in and out of mainland China due to the mergers of characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |title=\u6c49\u5b57\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6362\u4f4d\u601d\u8003 |publisher=\u4e2d\u56fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5b57\u7f51 |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021074254/http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On top of all that has been previously mentioned, the left-side radical of \u9394 (which is the left-side version of \u91d1) is almost never seen in simplified characters, since it has largely been replaced by the simplified left-side radical seen in characters like \u94f6, \u94dc, and \u94b1.\n*Professor Wang, at Beijing University of Education, also the Vice President of Chinese Language Association, and an official of Ministry of Education of China, agreed and criticized that some characters were oversimplified during the simplification campaign, and thus became counterproductively more difficult to learn, apply, and use.

These have sidelined the speed problems in handwritten Chinese, as traditional and simplified Chinese input methods have the same input speed, especially with phoneme-based IMEs. Thus, characters like \u9ad4/\u4f53 may be just as easy to input as the other, while the traditional form\u2014though more complex\u2014may offer a more distinctive shape that is therefore less easily confused with other common characters.

During the process of simplification, there are some attempts to bring greater coherence to the system. For example, the shape of \u6182 (''y\u014du''), meaning \"anxious\", is not a good indicator of its pronunciation, because there are no clear radical and phonetic components. The simplified version is \u5fe7, a straightforward combination of [[Radical 61|\u5fc4]], the \"heart\" radical to the left (indicating emotion) and the phonetic \u5c24 (''y\u00f3u'') to the right.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n*Simplification emphasizes the phonetic, rather than semantic, nature of the characters.

For example, \u7b11 (smile, laugh) uses the \"bamboo\" radical, which has no obvious relation to smiling or laughing.\n*\n*\n\n===Traditional radicals===\n*Some argue that simplification results in a broken connection between characters, which makes it more difficult for students to expand their vocabulary in terms of perceiving both the meaning and pronunciation of a new character.  For example, \u9b27, ''n\u00e0o'' (din, fuss) is now \u95f9, with the door radical [[Radical 169|\u95e8]] that is not indicative of its meaning.<ref name=\"CHQ\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/updates.php?searchterm=0903characters.inc|title=The Chinese Character\u2014no simple matter|work=China Heritage Quarterly|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=2012-03-02}}</ref>\n*The round of characters simplified by the Communist Party was not systematic.<ref name=\"Mcbride\">McBride-Chang, Catherine.

This actually makes it more difficult for simplified character readers to distinguish the characters, since they now rely heavily on memorization.<ref name=\"Mcbride\" />\n* Some traditional characters are very distinct, such as electricity/lightning \u96fb ''di\u00e0n'', rope \u7e69 ''sh\u00e9ng'' and turtle \u9f9c ''g\u016bi''.  After the simplification process all three characters appear to share the same component even though they have no relationship at all.  Respectively: electricity \u7535, rope \u7ef3, turtle \u9f9f can now conceivably be mistaken for one another, while their distinctions in the traditional forms are unmistakable. The simplification of the word electricity/lightning \u96fb to \u7535 also removed its semantic component. Stripped of its radical, \u7535 no longer bears any sense of semantic affinity with characters like snow \u96ea, thunder \u96f7, and hail \u96f9, themselves all untouched in the PRC simplification scheme.<ref name=\"Poser\"/> The same radical was similarly removed in the simplification of \"clouds\" \u96f2 to \u4e91.\n*Critics of the proposed replacement for the traditional system of radicals see the new system as being no less arbitrary than the existing system, it therefore only complicating matters to introduce a competing standard that as a radical departure from traditional radical arrangement might cause more confusion than simplification.<ref>The traditional system of radicals is no more arbitrary than, by analogy, the traditional order of the letters of the [[English alphabet]], or the English names for the letters, all of these being to varying extents agreed-upon standards which have enjoyed supreme precedence in their respective orthographic traditions.

The fine details of traditional Chinese characters are easy to discern in large size [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] but a number of complex characters are harder to distinguish when smaller fonts are used and complex character components can merge.

Many versions of the Chinese Classics have been published in simplified characters.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n*Acceptance of simplified characters is increasing, mirroring acceptance of the [[pinyin]] romanization system that was once a PRC and now an international standard, although with much greater resistance and to a significantly lesser extent. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Chinese as a foreign language]] was taught in countries like France and the United States solely in traditional characters. In the 1990s, universities in the United States were split between simplified and traditional, with simplified growing and traditional being taught mainly for the benefit of those who wish to learn [[Classical Chinese]], or Chinese for use in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, or overseas Chinese communities. Today, in terms of teaching and learning Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, the simplified characters has \"become the first choice because of student demand\".<ref name=Teaching>{{Cite book|title=Teaching and Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language: A Pedagogical Grammar|first=Janet Zhiqun|last=Xing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1drHAQAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|year=2006|pages=31\u201332, 105, 323|isbn=978-962-209-763-6}}</ref> Regardless, some instructors allow students the choice to write in either simplified or traditional characters.\n*With today's [[division of labor]], not all students need to learn to read classical texts.<ref name=\"rfd\"/> Schoolchildren can learn simplified characters first, and then traditional characters later if they want to be linguists or historians.<ref name=\"Zhou\"/>\n\n===Practicality of traditional characters===\n*If the PRC was able to impose its scheme of simplified characters on the majority of Chinese people, then a reversion to the use of traditional characters could hardly be any less feasible. From the pro-traditional point of view, there is as much reason, if not more, to return to the traditional orthography, as there ever was to simplify in the first place. Furthermore, it would be fatalistic and patronizing to deem Chinese people incapable of learning the older forms due merely to the sheer prevalence of simplified characters' usage in most of China today.\n*While written communication with the large population of mainland China and other communities requires the use of simplified Chinese, there are compelling practical reasons which require the use of traditional characters. The [[Republic of China]] (ROC) is the largest community of traditional character users and ROC President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] pushed for the removal of simplified Chinese translations which were available for use by Mainland internet users on government websites before June 15, 2011. Government documents and websites are to only use traditional characters and while simplified characters are not banned in Taiwan the president strongly encouraged the exclusive use of traditional characters, even in the tourism sector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roc-taiwan.org/ct.asp?xItem=205227&ctNode=2825&mp=52 |title=ROC to use traditional Chinese characters for official documents, websites |publisher=Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224843/http://www.roc-taiwan.org/ct.asp?xItem=205227&ctNode=2825&mp=52 |archivedate=2014-02-21 }}</ref> This move to protect traditional characters ensures that visitors to the Republic of China will need to learn traditional characters if they wish to use Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan-issues/2011/06/19/306696/p1/Ma-correct.htm |title=Ma correct to advocate use of traditional Chinese characters |publisher=The China Post |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n*Another common practical reason for the continuation of traditional characters is the expansive cultural legacy of Chinese history and art prior to simplification. The written form did evolve over the centuries but the traditional character set used today is much more closely related to the written Chinese which has been in use for thousands of years. As such the traditional characters are said to provide access to Chinese culture prior to simplification.<ref name=\"rfd\"/>\n*Those wishing to communicate or do business with overseas Chinese communities in the Western World require knowledge of traditional characters given their dominance in such communities and the negative connotations many in these communities associate with simplified characters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n*Many Chinese character dictionary apps can display both traditional and simplified versions of Chinese words, so being able to switch between character systems should not pose any major issues when reading traditional characters.\n\n==Politics==\nThe long history of Chinese characters and the role of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in the design and adoption of simplified characters means that there is often a strong political aspect to the debate on the usage of traditional and simplified Chinese characters.\n\n===Communist Party and simplified characters===\n*While the use of simplified Chinese is often associated with the PRC and its ruling Communist party the connection today is not as simple as it once may have been.

Immediately after, Korean media reported that the scholars and representatives reached a few conclusions after long discussion in the conference. One of those conclusions was that scholars would be using Traditional Chinese characters to standardise 5000 common Chinese characters across the countries and would continue to allow the use of Simplified Chinese characters if there happened to have one across those different areas. However, Chinese officials claimed that they did not reach such an agreement but would like to see the harmonious coexistence of Traditional and Simplified Chinese. Still, to many, that was the approval from Chinese Government because they were no longer absolutely opposed to the use of Traditional Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hk.epochtimes.com/7/11/8/54463.htm |title=\u6f22\u5b57\u64ec\u7d71\u4e00 \u6b63\u9ad4\u5b57\u70ba\u4e3b-\u9999\u6e2f\u5927\u7d00\u5143 |publisher=The Epoch Times |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/world/2007-11/07/content_7024376.htm |title=\u97d3\u570b\u5a92\u9ad4\u5831\u9053\u6709\u8aa4 \u4e2d\u65e5\u97d3\u4e26\u7121\u5354\u8b70\u7d71\u4e00\u6f22\u5b57 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===2008===\n\nIn March 2008, a Mainland author, Wang Gan, published a review article on his personal blog about the possibility of the re-introduction of Traditional Chinese, ''What About Abolishing Simplified Chinese within the Next 50 Years?''.<ref>Wang Gan, 2008-03-02, [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_47458e6501008kwi.html \u4e94\u5341\u5e74\u5185\uff0c\u5e9f\u9664\u7b80\u5316\u5b57\u5982\u4f55]</ref>\n\nTwenty-one members of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) delivered a proposal to add Traditional Chinese characters to the primary school curriculum.

Automated conversion, however, from simplified to traditional is not straightforward because there is not always a one-to-one mapping of a simplified character to a traditional character. One simplified character may equate to many traditional characters.

Moreover, the majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms that have been used in handwriting for centuries<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=S. Robert|title=The Languages of China|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01468-5|page=147}}</ref> such as the use of \u793c instead of \u79ae,<ref name=\"Norman_p81\">{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist)|title=Chinese|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|page=81|isbn=978-0-521-29653-3}}</ref> and some simplified characters are in fact restorations of ancient forms that had become more complicated over time. For instance, the character for \"cloud\" was originally \u4e91 in early inscriptions , but the character was borrowed to write a [[homophone|homophonous]] word meaning \"to say\". To disambiguate the two uses of the character, the \"rain\" radical ([[Radical 173|\u96e8]]) was added on top when it meant \"cloud\", forming the current traditional character \u96f2. The homophonous word meaning \"to say\", however, has become archaic in modern Chinese, though \u96f2 continues to be used for \"cloud\". The simplified version simply restores \u4e91 to its original use as \"cloud\".<ref name=\"Norman_p81\" />\n\n===Traditional characters===\nWhile some simplified characters were adopted from conventional abbreviated forms that have existed for a long time, those advocating the simplified forms often fail to point out that many such characters in fact had multiple vernacular forms out of which just one was chosen, arbitrarily, and then privileged by the designers of the simplified character scheme. Many of the changes can be seen as ideological, such as the removal of the \"heart\" (\u5fc3) from the word \"love\" (\u611b) into the new character (\u7231) without heart. To some, the new 'heartless' love character is an attack on [[Confucianism]], which emphasizes the virtues of [[filial piety]] and humanity in relationships so as to maintain a harmonious society.<ref name=\"Karlgren_1205\">{{cite book|last=Karlgren|first=Bernhard|title=Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1974.

They have alleged that simplified characters were arbitrarily schematized and then imposed by the PRC on its people with the intention of subverting and eradicating selected elements of traditional Chinese culture, in order to carry out what the PRC viewed as necessary revolutionary modernization. These critics point out that many of the fundamental characteristics underlying Chinese characters, including [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] as well as etymological and phonetic elements, were deliberately omitted in their simplified form at least partly for this reason (i.e. disrupting continuity with traditional Chinese culture). One frequently-cited example is the character for \"sage\" or \"holy\", \u5723 in simplified and \u8056 in traditional. The simplified character lacks the ''king'' radical ([[Radical 96|\u738b]]), replacing it with ''soil'' ([[Radical 32|\u571f]]). Supporters of simplification appeal to the fact that that \u5723 was often used, in handwriting, as a simplified variant of \u8056 long before the PRC itself came into being.<ref name=\"Karlgren_1205\" />  The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' furthermore classifies \u8056 as a ''xingsheng'' character with phonetic component \u5448.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/21/sw/8056.htm|title=Shuowen Jiezi \"\u8056\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Zdic.net|access-date=28 January 2018}}</ref>  Thus the origin of the character may have nothing to do with any cultural connection to kings or royalty.\n\nEven among supporters of simplification, some make the argument that Classical Chinese texts should not be printed in simplified Chinese because of the complexities involved in the use of ''tongjia'' (\u901a\u5047) or phonetic loan characters.  Ancient texts for instance might use the character \u5973 (''n\u01da'', \"women\") when the character \u6c5d (''r\u01d4'', \"thou\") is intended semantically because of their similar pronunciation in [[Old Chinese]].  The interpretation of ancient texts in often complicated by the presence of these phonetic loans, for which several very different meanings could be read.  Generally, the more ancient the text, the more numerous the phonetic loans, since separate characters were slowly introduced as the written language evolved, in order to disambiguate these loans.  For instance, the preclassical ''Book of Odes'' and the early classical ''Analects'' always uses \u5973 for \u6c5d, while texts from the Han dynasty or later nearly always use \u6c5d.<ref>Ironically, \u6c5d itself is also a phonetic loan, the original meaning being the name of a river.  This meaning is, of course, rarely used, compared to the character's use as the second-person pronoun.</ref>  \n\nThe merging of several traditional characters into one simplified character (e.g., \u9858 (''yu\u00e0n'', \"desire\", commonly used) and \u613f (''yu\u00e0n'', \"honest\", archaic and rare) to \u613f (both meanings) during the simplification process can be thought of as the modern introduction of phonetic loans.  This complicates an already complex landscape of ''tongjia'' characters appearing in classical texts, introducing additional possibilities for misinterpretation, particularly for beginning students.  Personal names of historical individuals are also problematic.  For example, there are two [[Six Dynasties]] period generals whose names are \u738b\u6fec (206-286) and \u738b\u6d5a (252-314), both of which are pronounced as ''W\u00e1ng J\u00f9n''.  However, according to the current PRC simplification scheme, the character \u6fec is considered to be an obsolete variant of \u6d5a, so to conform to standard orthography, these names should be written identically using \u6d5a.  Against this argument, proponents of simplified characters respond that simplified characters are more practical in all domains other than ancient literature and that it is uneconomical to introduce high school students, already burdened by schoolwork, to a new character set for the sole purpose of teaching the classical language.  Any potentially confusing usages can be remedied by providing appropriate annotations and glosses in footnotes, which are needed anyway for student editions of classical texts.  When the need arises, history and language majors in colleges and universities gradually learn to read scholarly editions of texts set in traditional characters without too much difficulty.  Nevertheless, classical texts set in traditional Chinese can be hard to find in mainland Chinese bookstores.  The Zhonghua Publishing House (''Zhonghua Shuju'', \u4e2d\u83ef\u66f8\u5c40) and several other specialist scholastic publishers are the only ones to routinely publish works in traditional characters.\n\n==Literacy==\n\n===Arguments for simplified characters===\n*Proponents feel that simplified characters with fewer strokes make learning easier.<ref name=\"Gunde, Richard 2002\">Gunde, Richard.

[[Classical Chinese]] mainly used one character for one word, which made it commonplace for one character to have multiple meanings and multiple pronunciations. E.g. \"\u5929\" means \"sky\" (\u5929\u82cd\u82cd), \"heaven\" (\u5929\u5c06\u964d\u5927\u4efb), \"nature\" (\u6d51\u7136\u5929\u6210), \"weather\" (\u5fc3\u5fe7\u70ad\u8d31\u613f\u5929\u5bd2); \"\u957f\" means \"length\" (''ch\u00e1ng'', \u957f\u4e00\u8eab\u6709\u534a), \"specialty\" (''ch\u00e1ng'', \u4e00\u6280\u4e4b\u957f), \"grow\" (''zh\u01ceng'', \u8349\u6728\u9042\u957f), \"senior\" (''zh\u01ceng'', \u4ee5\u541b\u4e3a\u957f\u8005), e.t.c. Context is vital to determining the meaning of a certain character in Classical Chinese. After the early 1900s' [[Vernacular Chinese]] movement, compound words were formed by multiple characters (usually two), and these words usually have only one meaning: \"\u5929\u7a7a\" meaning \"sky\", \"\u4e0a\u5929\" meaning \"heaven\", \"\u5929\u7136\" meaning \"nature\", \"\u5929\u6c14\" meaning \"weather\", \"\u957f\u5ea6\" meaning \"length\", \"\u751f\u957f\" meaning \"grow\", e.t.c. Context is not necessary to determine the meaning of a certain word. Thus, the act of merging characters which forms homophones, does not create confusion when using Vernacular Chinese. E.g. \"\u5934\u53d1\" (\u982d\u9aee, ''f\u00e0'') meaning \"hair\", \"\u51fa\u53d1\" (\u51fa\u767c, ''f\u0101'') meaning \"set off\", \"\u8c37\u7269\" (\u7a40\u7269, ''g\u01d4'') meaning \"grain\", \"\u5c71\u8c37\" (''g\u01d4'') meaning \"hollow\". Hence, simplification reduces the number of characters one would need to learn for everyday life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xys.org/fang/doc/history/jianhua2.txt|format=TXT |title=\u7b80\u4f53\u5b57\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u4e71\u5417\uff1f |author=\u65b9\u821f\u5b50 |website=Xys.org |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===Clarity of traditional characters===\n*Opponents cite a similar argument whereby the simplification of distinct characters caused them to be more difficult to discern apart.

Another example would be \u8a2d (''sh\u00e8'') for \"designate\", and \u6c92 (''m\u00e9i'') for \"without\", which are quite hard to distinguish apart in their simplified forms \u8bbe and {{lang|zh-cn|\u6ca1}} and can result in confusion in quick handwriting. This type of confusion has happened before for the characters \u8b80 (''d\u00fa'') for \"read\" and \u7006 (''d\u00fa'') for \"showing disrespect\" which were confused for each other in their simplified forms \u8bfb and \u6e0e respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/07/speak-mandarin-campaign-uses-wrong-chinese-character-for-the-word-read/|title=Speak Mandarin Campaign uses wrong Chinese character for the word \u2018Read\u2019|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref> (Another example of the same kind is \u6d3b (''hu\u00f3'') \"to live\" and \u8a71 (''hu\u00e0'') \"talk,\" which in simplified are \u6d3b and \u8bdd and can be misinterpreted in rapid handwriting). \n*Similarly, some simplified characters create more confusion.

According to earlier Chinese laws regarding Chinese Language Simplification, character \u2018\u9394\u2019 should have always been written as \u2018\u7194\u2019; however, Zhu Rongji insisted on writing \u2018\u9394\u2019 when it came down to writing his name because he was originally named in the character \u2018\u9394\u2019but not \u2018\u7194\u2019. Thus, the Board later re-introduced the character. Proponents of traditional characters thus argue against the use of simplified chinese, especially when it comes down to mergers of characters in names of historical heroes, scholars, philosophers, and political figures. They also report trouble in flight reservations when traveling in and out of mainland China due to the mergers of characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |title=\u6c49\u5b57\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u6362\u4f4d\u601d\u8003 |publisher=\u4e2d\u56fd\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5b57\u7f51 |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021074254/http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |archive-date=2013-10-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On top of all that has been previously mentioned, the left-side radical of \u9394 (which is the left-side version of \u91d1) is almost never seen in simplified characters, since it has largely been replaced by the simplified left-side radical seen in characters like \u94f6, \u94dc, and \u94b1.\n*Professor Wang, at Beijing University of Education, also the Vice President of Chinese Language Association, and an official of Ministry of Education of China, agreed and criticized that some characters were oversimplified during the simplification campaign, and thus became counterproductively more difficult to learn, apply, and use.

Most IMEs use [[phoneme]]-based input, such as [[pinyin]] romanization or [[bopomofo]], while others are [[grapheme]]-based, such as [[cangjie method|cangjie]] and [[wubi method|wubi]]. These have sidelined the speed problems in handwritten Chinese, as traditional and simplified Chinese input methods have the same input speed, especially with phoneme-based IMEs. Thus, characters like \u9ad4/\u4f53 may be just as easy to input as the other, while the traditional form\u2014though more complex\u2014may offer a more distinctive shape that is therefore less easily confused with other common characters. (\u9ad4 would never, for instance, be mistaken for \u4f11.) Furthermore, even when it comes to handwriting, a majority of people resort to [[semi-cursive script]] to reduce strokes and save time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n*\n*\n\n==Phonetics==\n\n===Relation with simplified characters===\n*Proponents point out that Chinese characters are most often made up of a pronunciation-indicating part (called the ''phonetic'') and a part that indicates the general [[semantics|semantic]] domain (called the ''radical''). During the process of simplification, there are some attempts to bring greater coherence to the system. For example, the shape of \u6182 (''y\u014du''), meaning \"anxious\", is not a good indicator of its pronunciation, because there are no clear radical and phonetic components. The simplified version is \u5fe7, a straightforward combination of [[Radical 61|\u5fc4]], the \"heart\" radical to the left (indicating emotion) and the phonetic \u5c24 (''y\u00f3u'') to the right.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n*Simplification emphasizes the phonetic, rather than semantic, nature of the characters.

For the simplification to be consistent, \u5362 should have been used instead of \u6237 as the righthand component in \u7089, as they are originally identical as \u76e7.<ref>[[w:Zhengzhang Shangfang|Zhengzhang, Shangfang]] ({{zh|\u912d\u5f35\u5c1a\u82b3}}) (2003). {{lang|zh|\u4e0a\u53e4\u97f3\u7cfb}} (''Old Chinese Phonology''), Shanghai: Shanghai Education Press. {{ISBN|978-7-5320-9244-4}}.</ref> Some characters were radically stripped of all phonetic elements. An example of a traditional character simplified such that its phonetic element is totally removed is \u5ee3 (''gu\u01ceng'', meaning \"extensive\"), of which the internal character \u9ec3 (''hu\u00e1ng'') is enclosed within a \u5e7f.

The re-phonologizing of simplified characters further jeopardizes the writing system's traditional ability to bring mutual understanding between speakers of different, especially non-[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Chinese dialects.<ref name=\"Poser\"/>\n* Uncoordinated simplification policies imposed on postwar Japan have led to instances of there being three forms of the same character in widespread use, for example, traditional \u95dc was simplified to \u95a2 in postwar Japan but to \u5173 in the PRC.

After the simplification process all three characters appear to share the same component even though they have no relationship at all.  Respectively: electricity \u7535, rope \u7ef3, turtle \u9f9f can now conceivably be mistaken for one another, while their distinctions in the traditional forms are unmistakable. The simplification of the word electricity/lightning \u96fb to \u7535 also removed its semantic component. Stripped of its radical, \u7535 no longer bears any sense of semantic affinity with characters like snow \u96ea, thunder \u96f7, and hail \u96f9, themselves all untouched in the PRC simplification scheme.<ref name=\"Poser\"/> The same radical was similarly removed in the simplification of \"clouds\" \u96f2 to \u4e91.\n*Critics of the proposed replacement for the traditional system of radicals see the new system as being no less arbitrary than the existing system, it therefore only complicating matters to introduce a competing standard that as a radical departure from traditional radical arrangement might cause more confusion than simplification.<ref>The traditional system of radicals is no more arbitrary than, by analogy, the traditional order of the letters of the [[English alphabet]], or the English names for the letters, all of these being to varying extents agreed-upon standards which have enjoyed supreme precedence in their respective orthographic traditions.

From the pro-traditional point of view, there is as much reason, if not more, to return to the traditional orthography, as there ever was to simplify in the first place. Furthermore, it would be fatalistic and patronizing to deem Chinese people incapable of learning the older forms due merely to the sheer prevalence of simplified characters' usage in most of China today.\n*While written communication with the large population of mainland China and other communities requires the use of simplified Chinese, there are compelling practical reasons which require the use of traditional characters. The [[Republic of China]] (ROC) is the largest community of traditional character users and ROC President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] pushed for the removal of simplified Chinese translations which were available for use by Mainland internet users on government websites before June 15, 2011.

For example, the book ''Whispers and Moans'' was very popular in Hong Kong but a simplified character edition was blocked by Beijing's Central Bureau of Censorship, and the original edition could not be sold legally on the mainland because it was in traditional characters. The book, which is about the [[sex trade]] in Hong Kong, was said to conflict with the mainland's [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law]].<ref name=\"Yang\">Yang, Yishan.

The conference was conducted and hosted by the National Office of International Promotion of Chinese Language and Board of Language Usage & Applications of the Ministry of Education of China. Immediately after, Korean media reported that the scholars and representatives reached a few conclusions after long discussion in the conference. One of those conclusions was that scholars would be using Traditional Chinese characters to standardise 5000 common Chinese characters across the countries and would continue to allow the use of Simplified Chinese characters if there happened to have one across those different areas. However, Chinese officials claimed that they did not reach such an agreement but would like to see the harmonious coexistence of Traditional and Simplified Chinese. Still, to many, that was the approval from Chinese Government because they were no longer absolutely opposed to the use of Traditional Chinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hk.epochtimes.com/7/11/8/54463.htm |title=\u6f22\u5b57\u64ec\u7d71\u4e00 \u6b63\u9ad4\u5b57\u70ba\u4e3b-\u9999\u6e2f\u5927\u7d00\u5143 |publisher=The Epoch Times |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/world/2007-11/07/content_7024376.htm |title=\u97d3\u570b\u5a92\u9ad4\u5831\u9053\u6709\u8aa4 \u4e2d\u65e5\u97d3\u4e26\u7121\u5354\u8b70\u7d71\u4e00\u6f22\u5b57 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n===2008===\n\nIn March 2008, a Mainland author, Wang Gan, published a review article on his personal blog about the possibility of the re-introduction of Traditional Chinese, ''What About Abolishing Simplified Chinese within the Next 50 Years?''.<ref>Wang Gan, 2008-03-02, [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_47458e6501008kwi.html \u4e94\u5341\u5e74\u5185\uff0c\u5e9f\u9664\u7b80\u5316\u5b57\u5982\u4f55]</ref>\n\nTwenty-one members of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) delivered a proposal to add Traditional Chinese characters to the primary school curriculum.

XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could scarcely believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gi\u017cycki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance. The couple's next destinations in the Opel were [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria and Lebanon]], which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek obtained visas from reluctant Vichy officials and they continued their journey. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118.</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs. He is now in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [\u2026]. I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Krystyna, their second child, took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than [[side-saddle]] as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to [[Zakopane]] in the [[Tatra mountains]] of southern Poland.

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 1930, Krystyna married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour.

Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there.<ref name=\"Christine p. 24\">M.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and a doctor diagnosed her (incorrectly) with terminal tuberculosis. The Germans released them, but the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided to flee Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>\n\n===Car journey===\nThe British Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the [[Soviet Union]], indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could scarcely believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continued on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gizyeki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded Gizyeki to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance.

These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed a band called [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing [[Dennis Stratton]]. Following a short-lived solo project called [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and, after a year-long hiatus, formed the bands The Untouchables and, subsequently, [[Psycho Motel]]. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer [[Bruce Dickinson]]. Smith and Dickinson would go on to return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success.

is an English guitarist and member of [[Iron Maiden]], for whom he writes songs and performs live backing vocals on some tracks.\n\nSmith grew up in London and became interested in rock music at 15. He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed a band called [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing [[Dennis Stratton]]. Following a short-lived solo project called [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and, after a year-long hiatus, formed the bands The Untouchables and, subsequently, [[Psycho Motel]]. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer [[Bruce Dickinson]]. Smith and Dickinson would go on to return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. Smith has a current side project called [[Primal Rock Rebellion]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years and Urchin: 1977\u20131980===\nBorn in Hackney,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=164}} Smith grew up in Clapton.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bushell|first1=Garry|authorlink1=Garry Bushell|last2=Halfin|first2=Ross|authorlink2=Ross Halfin|title=Running Free, The Official Story of Iron Maiden|edition=2nd|publisher=Zomba Books|year=1985|page=[https://archive.org/details/ironmaidenrunnin00bush/page/80 80]|isbn=0-946391-84-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ironmaidenrunnin00bush/page/80}}</ref> He purchased his first record, [[Deep Purple]]'s ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'', at the age of 15. This led him to befriend Dave Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=165}} with whom he formed a band called Stone Free, which comprised Murray on guitar, Smith on vocals and their friend, Dave McCloughlin, playing the bongos.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=41}}\n\nAfter seeing the attention Murray received from girls,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=165}} Smith took up the guitar, starting with an old Spanish guitar once owned by his brother, before purchasing an old one of Murray's for \u00a35.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=166}} His early influences included [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], which he claims made him a \"melodic player\" rather than a \"speed merchant or a [[Shred guitar|shredder]]\" as he \"was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal.\"<ref name=\"Total Guitar\">{{cite journal|title=Iron Maiden: Adrian Smith|journal=[[Total Guitar]]|date=1 December 2010|first=Joel|last=McIver|issue=208|pages=40\u201342 }}</ref>\n\nLeaving school after completing his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-levels]], Smith formed a band called Evil Ways, including Dave Murray on guitar, which was later renamed [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=167}} Smith began writing his own material, including \"22 Acacia Avenue\", which was later included on [[Iron Maiden]]'s ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1982).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=167}}\n\nAt this point, Murray left the band to join Iron Maiden and Urchin signed with [[DJM Records]] and released a single, \"Black Leather Fantasy\", in 1977.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=168}} Shortly afterwards, Murray joined Urchin on their next single, \"She's a Roller\", as he had been sacked from Iron Maiden after a row with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock, although he was reinstated six months later. Smith was also offered a place in Iron Maiden while they were in the process of signing with [[EMI]] in 1979, but turned them down to continue with his own band, a decision he later regretted as Urchin split up in 1980.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=168-69}}\n\n===First tenure in Iron Maiden: 1980\u20131990===\n{{Main|Iron Maiden}}\nWithout a band, Smith was left \"wondering what to do next,\" before he \"literally bumped into [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve [Harris]]] and Dave,\" who asked if he might want to reconsider joining.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=169}} After a successful audition,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=170}} Smith debuted with the band on a German TV show, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' album, released in 1981.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=171}} Smith's first song-writing contributions appeared on ''The Number of the Beast'', co-penning \"Gangland\" and \"The Prisoner\", as well as the previously mentioned \"22 Acacia Avenue\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=224}} after which he began co-writing many songs with singer [[Bruce Dickinson]], on the following ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=244}}<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/piece-of-mind-mw0000045853 | title = Iron Maiden \u2013 ''Piece of Mind'' review | accessdate = 28 September 2011 | last = Huey | first = Steve | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]|work=[[AllMusic]] | quote = We also get greater involvement in the songwriting from Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith, whose themes are perfectly in tune with Steve Harris' epic storytelling.}}</ref>\n\nSmith and Dave Murray combined playing dual lead guitars, creating what [[AllMusic]] calls \"the most formidable twin-guitar attack in heavy metal, outside of [[Glenn Tipton]] and [[K.

Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father, King Peppy tells the story of how the Troll tribes became scattered throughout their world Troll Kingdom. He explains how the six primary tribes, each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]] are powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Queen Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy refuses to  listen, sending a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him after realising one of the Troll Tribes look just like him. He goes into a forest coming upon a monster. He escapes but ends up lost in a desert. He tries to drink from a mirage, but snaps out of it and is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles. \n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn, leader of the Country Trolls.\n\nWhile in jail, a Country Troll named Hickory, claiming to be moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Hickory builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Queen Barb. Chaz plays smooth jazz which causes Poppy and Branch to fall into a dream-like state, imagining [[Narwhal|narwhals]] and Branch feeding sushi sized replicas of himself to Poppy with chopsticks. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been the long lost identical twin of the Funk Troll prince, Prince D, of the Funk Trolls all along. His egg was snatched out of the nest when he and his twin were babies. His Mum and Dad couldn\u2019t find him so the Pop Trolls raised his as one of their own. Cooper then tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]]. His parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, also reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. Biggie returns home and after seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls. \n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar.

Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Ron Funches]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the blue string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still adjusting to her new role as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father, King Peppy tells the story of how the Troll tribes became scattered throughout their world Troll Kingdom. He explains how the six primary tribes, each represented by a different style of music: [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Funk]]. [[Classical music|Classical]], [[Techno]], [[Country music|Country]], and [[Rock music|Rock]] are powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having separated their tribes following discord and disagreement over which style of music was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Queen Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy refuses to  listen, sending a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[Rock music|rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him after realising one of the Troll Tribes look just like him. He goes into a forest coming upon a monster. He escapes but ends up lost in a desert. He tries to drink from a mirage, but snaps out of it and is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles. \n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, is in ruins. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy their town had been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens and stole the yellow Classical string. Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the pink Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn, leader of the Country Trolls.\n\nWhile in jail, a Country Troll named Hickory, claiming to be moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Hickory builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Queen Barb. Chaz plays smooth jazz which causes Poppy and Branch to fall into a dream-like state, imagining [[Narwhal|narwhals]] and Branch feeding sushi sized replicas of himself to Poppy with chopsticks. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been the long lost identical twin of the Funk Troll prince, Prince D, of the Funk Trolls all along. His egg was snatched out of the nest when he and his twin were babies. His Mum and Dad couldn\u2019t find him so the Pop Trolls raised his as one of their own. Cooper then tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]]. His parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, also reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hijack the Funk Trolls' ship to steal the purple Funk String, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory urges her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. Biggie returns home and after seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls. \n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs.

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket.

By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water.

Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X|bibcode=2003NIMPA.501..418F }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010.

In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target.

This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions.

Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector.

It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis.

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]. -->\nIn [[Harlem]], Manhattan Island, [[New York City]], [[Little Orphan Annie|Annie Bennett]] (Quvenzhan\u00e8 Wallis) lives in [[foster care]] with several other girls under the care of Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), a bitter former singer who spends her days drinking and trying to snag a sweetheart. Annie spends Fridays waiting outside ''Domani's'' restaurant, believing her parents will come for her because a note written on a receipt from ''Domani's'' says they will return. When a city inspector checks on Miss Hannigan's treatment of the girls, Annie takes advantage of the situation; she manages to copy her [[social security number]] from his clipboard and heads off to get her information. Annie learns that there is nothing more about her than what she already knows.\n\nWhile attempting to save a [[Shiba Inu]] from bullies, Annie is nearly run over but is saved by William \"Will\" Stacks \n(Jamie Foxx), a [[mysophobia|germaphobe]] [[cellphone]] mogul running for [[Mayor of New York City]]. Annie's rescue goes viral on the internet, boosting Stacks popularity; per suggestion of Will's campaign manager Guy Danlily, Annie moves in with Will to boost his popularity further. Annie enjoys her new surroundings, befriending Will's assistant Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne). Annie also gets to adopt the stray dog from before, naming her Sandy. Bonding with Annie, Will reveals that he had humble beginnings in Queens; he never really knew his father due to his work hours, but believed he could understand him if he worked just as hard. Annie also helps Grace and Will realize that they like each other romantically.\n\nPer Annie's request, Will takes her and her friends in Miss Hannigan's foster care to see the premiere of ''MoonQuake Lake''. Stacks is uninterested in the movie at first, but soon becomes a major fan along with Grace. Per Annie and Grace's insistence, Stacks joins the after-movie party. After returning her friends home, Annie shows Grace her Friday routine of waiting to see if her parents will return; Grace sympathizes, agreeing to keep this a secret from Will. At Miss Hannigan's, the girls accidentally wake her; Miss Hannigan snaps at them, saying rich people are not nice and will ditch anyone they do not like any more (recalling her own past). Slightly hungover, she laments about her situation of foster kids and her desire to reclaim stardom.\n\nWhen Annie is asked to read a speech during a charity event, she runs out and reveals that she does not know how to read despite being 10 years old and attending school. Will decides to get her a special-ed teacher, but Guy decides that Annie will only hinder Will's campaign as his popularity is not improving any more. Teaming up with Miss Hannigan, Guy plans to have impostors claim Annie as their daughter to boost Will's popularity to the point where he wins; Guy will then share his payment with Miss Hannigan. However, Guy plans to dump Annie back into the system after the election, uncaring about her well-being. By the time Miss Hannigan has second thoughts, Annie has already been kidnapped by the imposters; Miss Hannigan tells Will about the plan, getting Guy fired. Will, Grace, Miss Hannigan and the girls board Will's helicopter; aided by the police, they chase the getaway car into the park. Thinking Will arranged this (due to the kidnappers believing Will, not Guy, paid them), an upset Annie angrily refuses to believe him when he tells her he didn't know about the scheme. To prove his innocence, Will announces to the press that he quits the mayoral race, to which Annie helps Grace and Will admit their love for each other. Will cheers Annie up when he decides to adopt her, then all three dance and sing happily.\n\nAnnie announces the opening of the \"Stacks Literacy Centre\", to help children like herself, who can't read. Everyone sings Annie's ''Tomorrow''; humorously, Miss Hannigan attempts to continue singing after the song is done, only to receive stares that cue her to stop.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis]] as [[Little Orphan Annie|Annie Bennett Stacks]], an 11-year-old [[African American]] child living in a [[foster home]] searching for her parents.

Hannigan's character is softened from her prior appearances, to the point of experiencing guilt over her part in separating Stacks and Annie and even helping to rescue Annie from her false parents in the film's finale. Miss Hannigan's first name is also changed to Colleen, instead of her previous film name Agatha.\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Guy Danlily, a \"bulldog political adviser\" to Stacks.

Executive music supervisor Matt Sullivan explained that there was a desire to make the film's use of music \"seamless\" rather than \"abrupt\", and to maintain the integrity and familiarity of the musical's most iconic songs, including \"Tomorrow\" and \"It's the Hard Knock Life\". The songs were rearranged with a percussive, [[pop music|pop]]-inspired style: in particular, \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" \u2014 whilst maintaining the use of \"natural\" sounds for its rhythm \u2014 was updated in a [[hip hop]] style. Lyrics to some songs were also updated to reflect the differences in the film's storyline and settings.<ref name=billboard-ruinchildhood /> Furler and Kurstin wrote three new songs for the soundtrack: \"Opportunity\", \"Who Am I\", and \"Moonquake Lake\".

See [[WP:FILMPLOT]]. -->\nIn [[Harlem]], Manhattan Island, [[New York City]], [[Little Orphan Annie|Annie Bennett]] (Quvenzhan\u00e8 Wallis) lives in [[foster care]] with several other girls under the care of Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), a bitter former singer who spends her days drinking and trying to snag a sweetheart. Annie spends Fridays waiting outside ''Domani's'' restaurant, believing her parents will come for her because a note written on a receipt from ''Domani's'' says they will return. When a city inspector checks on Miss Hannigan's treatment of the girls, Annie takes advantage of the situation; she manages to copy her [[social security number]] from his clipboard and heads off to get her information. Annie learns that there is nothing more about her than what she already knows.\n\nWhile attempting to save a [[Shiba Inu]] from bullies, Annie is nearly run over but is saved by William \"Will\" Stacks \n(Jamie Foxx), a [[mysophobia|germaphobe]] [[cellphone]] mogul running for [[Mayor of New York City]]. Annie's rescue goes viral on the internet, boosting Stacks popularity; per suggestion of Will's campaign manager Guy Danlily, Annie moves in with Will to boost his popularity further. Annie enjoys her new surroundings, befriending Will's assistant Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne). Annie also gets to adopt the stray dog from before, naming her Sandy. Bonding with Annie, Will reveals that he had humble beginnings in Queens; he never really knew his father due to his work hours, but believed he could understand him if he worked just as hard. Annie also helps Grace and Will realize that they like each other romantically.\n\nPer Annie's request, Will takes her and her friends in Miss Hannigan's foster care to see the premiere of ''MoonQuake Lake''. Stacks is uninterested in the movie at first, but soon becomes a major fan along with Grace. Per Annie and Grace's insistence, Stacks joins the after-movie party. After returning her friends home, Annie shows Grace her Friday routine of waiting to see if her parents will return; Grace sympathizes, agreeing to keep this a secret from Will. At Miss Hannigan's, the girls accidentally wake her; Miss Hannigan snaps at them, saying rich people are not nice and will ditch anyone they do not like any more (recalling her own past). Slightly hungover, she laments about her situation of foster kids and her desire to reclaim stardom.\n\nWhen Annie is asked to read a speech during a charity event, she runs out and reveals that she does not know how to read despite being 10 years old and attending school. Will decides to get her a special-ed teacher, but Guy decides that Annie will only hinder Will's campaign as his popularity is not improving any more. Teaming up with Miss Hannigan, Guy plans to have impostors claim Annie as their daughter to boost Will's popularity to the point where he wins; Guy will then share his payment with Miss Hannigan. However, Guy plans to dump Annie back into the system after the election, uncaring about her well-being. By the time Miss Hannigan has second thoughts, Annie has already been kidnapped by the imposters; Miss Hannigan tells Will about the plan, getting Guy fired. Will, Grace, Miss Hannigan and the girls board Will's helicopter; aided by the police, they chase the getaway car into the park. Thinking Will arranged this (due to the kidnappers believing Will, not Guy, paid them), an upset Annie angrily refuses to believe him when he tells her he didn't know about the scheme. To prove his innocence, Will announces to the press that he quits the mayoral race, to which Annie helps Grace and Will admit their love for each other. Will cheers Annie up when he decides to adopt her, then all three dance and sing happily.\n\nAnnie announces the opening of the \"Stacks Literacy Centre\", to help children like herself, who can't read. Everyone sings Annie's ''Tomorrow''; humorously, Miss Hannigan attempts to continue singing after the song is done, only to receive stares that cue her to stop.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis]] as [[Little Orphan Annie|Annie Bennett Stacks]], an 11-year-old [[African American]] child living in a [[foster home]] searching for her parents.

Executive music supervisor Matt Sullivan explained that there was a desire to make the film's use of music \"seamless\" rather than \"abrupt\", and to maintain the integrity and familiarity of the musical's most iconic songs, including \"Tomorrow\" and \"It's the Hard Knock Life\". The songs were rearranged with a percussive, [[pop music|pop]]-inspired style: in particular, \"It's the Hard Knock Life\" \u2014 whilst maintaining the use of \"natural\" sounds for its rhythm \u2014 was updated in a [[hip hop]] style. Lyrics to some songs were also updated to reflect the differences in the film's storyline and settings.<ref name=billboard-ruinchildhood /> Furler and Kurstin wrote three new songs for the soundtrack: \"Opportunity\", \"Who Am I\", and \"Moonquake Lake\".
