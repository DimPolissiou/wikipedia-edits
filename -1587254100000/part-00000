Fan vote only counted for 25% of the total score and scoring was now translated directly from percentages rather than into ordinals. The judges scores were added up, and each performer was given points based on the percentage of the total points distributed among all performers. (For example, a team received a score of 25. A total of 207 points were awarded to all nine performers. The team received 12.08% of that total, so that team earned 12.08 points. The couple happens to be Sara & Anton.) The fan vote was handled the same way, with the points based on how much of the total fan vote the star received. (So, in the same example, if the team earned 15% of the total fan vote, their grand total is 27.08 points.)<ref name=\"scoring-3\">{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/vote.html |title=Scoring and elimination procedure for ''Dancing with the Stars'', Season 3 |publisher=Abc.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310033122/http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/vote.html |archive-date=2007-03-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 2006, former [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Erin Boag]] were announced the winners, marking the second win for Burke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/16/emmitt-smith-wins-dancing-with-stars.html|title=Emmitt Smith Wins 'Dancing With the Stars'|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=November 16, 2006|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|work=[[Fox News]]|author=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607043954/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/16/emmitt-smith-wins-dancing-with-stars.html|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Couples===\nThe number of couples competing expanded to eleven from the ten in [[Dancing with the Stars (US season 2)|the previous season]].\n\nOn October 12, 2006, [[Sara Evans]] announced her withdrawal from the competition to be with her kids after filing for divorce from her husband, Craig Schelske.<ref name=\"Evans withdrawal\">[http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061013/ENTERTAINMENT06/61013002 ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> In a \"final appearance\",<ref name=\"Evans Oct. 17\">{{cite web |url=http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1545889,00.html |title=People Connection \u2013 Main |publisher=People.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202020342/http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1545889,00.html |archive-date=2006-12-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> a pre-taped interview with Evans about her decision was shown on the October 17 episode.

The judges scores were added up, and each performer was given points based on the percentage of the total points distributed among all performers. (For example, a team received a score of 25. A total of 207 points were awarded to all nine performers. The team received 12.08% of that total, so that team earned 12.08 points. The couple happens to be Sara & Tony.) The fan vote was handled the same way, with the points based on how much of the total fan vote the star received. (So, in the same example, if the team earned 15% of the total fan vote, their grand total is 27.08 points.)<ref name=\"scoring-3\">{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/vote.html |title=Scoring and elimination procedure for ''Dancing with the Stars'', Season 3 |publisher=Abc.go.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310033122/http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/vote.html |archive-date=2007-03-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nOn November 15, 2006, former [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Emmitt Smith]] and [[Cheryl Burke]] were announced the winners, marking the second win for Burke.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/16/emmitt-smith-wins-dancing-with-stars.html|title=Emmitt Smith Wins 'Dancing With the Stars'|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=November 16, 2006|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]|work=[[Fox News]]|author=Associated Press|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607043954/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/16/emmitt-smith-wins-dancing-with-stars.html|archive-date=June 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Couples===\nThe number of couples competing expanded to eleven from the ten in [[Dancing with the Stars (US season 2)|the previous season]].\n\nOn October 12, 2006, [[Sara Evans]] announced her withdrawal from the competition to be with her kids after filing for divorce from her husband, Craig Schelske.<ref name=\"Evans withdrawal\">[http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061013/ENTERTAINMENT06/61013002 ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}</ref> In a \"final appearance\",<ref name=\"Evans Oct. 17\">{{cite web |url=http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1545889,00.html |title=People Connection \u2013 Main |publisher=People.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202020342/http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1545889,00.html |archive-date=2006-12-02 |url-status=live }}</ref> a pre-taped interview with Evans about her decision was shown on the October 17 episode.

From 1924 until 1959, it was also the parent company of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] (MGM). \n\nThe company was originally called \"Loew's\", after the founder, Marcus Loew. In 1969, when the Tisch brothers acquired the company, it became known as \"Loews\". The company merged with Canadian-based [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] in 1998 only to become bankrupt in 2001. The company merged with [[AMC Theatres]] on January 26, 2006 while the Canadian operations merged with [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex Galaxy]] in 2003.\n\nThe '''Loews Theatres''' name was used until 2017, when AMC simplified their branding to focus on three main lines: AMC, AMC Classic and AMC Dine-In after their purchase of [[Carmike Cinemas]]. Prior to the discontinuation, Loews Cineplex operated its theatres under the Loews Theatres, Cineplex Odeon, [[Star Theatres]] and [[Magic Johnson Theatres]] brands. Its corporate offices were located in New York and Toronto.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Loews Theatre Toronto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Loew's Theatre]] in Toronto, Canada, in 1945]]\n\nLoew's Theatres Incorporated was founded in 1904 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], by entrepreneur Marcus Loew. Loew founded a chain of [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] theaters which showed short silent films in storefront locations. Soon the successful enterprise grew to include deluxe [[vaudeville]] houses and finally lavish [[movie palace]]s. Loew's theaters were found in cities from coast-to-coast, but primarily in East Coast and Midwest states.\n\nTo provide quality films for his theaters, Loew founded [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Pictures (MGM) in 1924, by merging the earlier firms [[Metro Pictures]], [[Goldwyn Pictures]], and [[Louis B. Mayer Productions]]. Loew's Incorporated served as distribution arm and parent company for the studio until the two were forced to separate by the 1948 [[US Supreme Court]] ruling ''[[United States v.

Loews Corporation by this time was a holding company owned by brothers [[Preston Robert Tisch|Robert]] and [[Laurence Tisch]] highly diversified in non-entertainment business interests ranging from hotels to insurance.

For a while, Loews operated under the '''Sony Theaters''' banner.\n\nIn 1994, Sony partnered with [[Magic Johnson]] to form [[Magic Johnson Theaters]], a mini-chain of theaters specifically geared toward the [[inner city|inner cities]], particularly in Los Angeles. A year before, [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]] was installed in several theaters, since the parent company used it to promote Sony's cinema sound division, which eventually shut down in 2002.\n\nIn 1998, [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] merged with Loews Theaters to form '''Loews Cineplex Entertainment'''. The combined company was one of the largest movie exhibitors in the world, with theaters in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Spain.

From 1924 until 1959, it was also the parent company of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios]] (MGM). \n\nThe company was originally called \"Loew's\", after the founder, Marcus Loew. In 1969, when the Tisch brothers acquired the company, it became known as \"Loews\". The company merged with Canadian-based [[Cineplex Odeon Corporation]] in 1998 only to become bankrupt in 2001. The company merged with [[AMC Theatres]] on January 26, 2006 while the Canadian operations merged with [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex Galaxy]] in 2003.\n\nThe '''Loews Theatres''' name was used until 2017, when AMC simplified their branding to focus on three main lines: AMC, AMC Classic and AMC Dine-In after their purchase of [[Carmike Cinemas]]. Prior to the discontinuation, Loews Cineplex operated its theatres under the Loews Theatres, Cineplex Odeon, [[Star Theatres]] and [[Magic Johnson Theatres]] brands. Its corporate offices were located in New York and Toronto.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Loews Theatre Toronto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Loew's Theatre]] in Toronto, Canada, in 1945]]\n\nLoew's Theatres Incorporated was founded in 1904 in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], by entrepreneur Marcus Loew. Loew founded a chain of [[nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] theaters which showed short silent films in storefront locations. Soon the successful enterprise grew to include deluxe [[vaudeville]] houses and finally lavish [[movie palace]]s. Loew's theaters were found in cities from coast-to-coast, but primarily in East Coast and Midwest states.\n\nTo provide quality films for his theaters, Loew founded [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Pictures (MGM) in 1924, by merging the earlier firms [[Metro Pictures]], [[Goldwyn Pictures]], and [[Louis B. Mayer|Louis B. Mayer Productions]]. Loew's Incorporated served as distribution arm and parent company for the studio until the two were forced to separate by the 1948 [[US Supreme Court]] ruling ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' The two companies officially split in 1959.\n\nIn 1985, when federal regulations had been relaxed, [[Tri-Star Pictures]], then a joint venture co-owned by [[The Coca-Cola Company]] (also owners of [[Columbia Pictures]] at the time) [[CBS]], and [[Time Inc.]]'s [[HBO]], acquired the Loews theater chain from [[Loews Corporation]], the successor company to the original firm founded by Marcus Loew.

This causes a massive drain in manpower which puts a strain on the country.

The family later relocated to San Diego. DeMartini became interested in [[Rock and roll|rock music]] due to the influence of his older brothers Bernard and James, whose band rehearsed in the family basement. His grandmother was also a musician of note, playing piano accompaniment to silent movies in [[Preston, Minnesota]].\n\nDeMartini's mother bought him a guitar at his request when he was \"around seven or eight years old\". According to Warren, he struggled early on learning to play it due to the tuning pegs being cheap, causing the instrument to constantly fall out of tune. As a result, he became frustrated and smashed the instrument as he had seen [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] do onstage. As a result, that was the last guitar he would receive as a gift. At age 14, he had to get himself a job in order to raise the money to purchase a new electric guitar, a [[Cimar]] [[Les Paul guitar|Les Paul]] copy. The first song DeMartini learned was [[Sunshine of Your Love]] by [[Cream (band)|Cream]], which he learned by ear.<ref name=\"guitarworld.com\"/>\n\nWarren played his first concert with his band the Plague in front of a small crowd at San Diego's [[La Jolla High School]] at the age of 15. By this time he was emerging as one of the San Diego area's most talented and sought-after young guitar players. The first year he signed up, he won \"Best New Guitar Player in San Diego\" at ''Guitar Trader'' on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. He graduated from high school in 1981. DeMartini began taking classes at a local college, but in the first semester was invited up to Los Angeles to join Mickey Ratt; the band that would eventually become the highly successful 1980s metal band, [[Ratt]].<ref>[http://innocentwords.com/warren-demartini-laying-it-down-since-83/] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ratt==\n{{Main|Ratt}}\nDeMartini replaced [[Jake E.

DeMartini was at one point the roommate of Lee, and each greatly influenced the other's styles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nDeMartini's lead guitar became one of Ratt's most recognizable aspects, and he would co-write several of the band's best known songs, including \"[[Round and Round (Ratt song)|Round and Round]]\", \"[[Lay It Down (Ratt song)|Lay It Down]]\", \"[[Dance (Ratt song)|Dance]]\", and \"[[Way Cool Jr.]]\". Ratt would ultimately become one of the top-selling and most popular [[metal]] acts of the decade, issuing four consecutive platinum albums and one EP in the 1980s before disbanding in February 1992.\n\n==Post-Ratt and Returns==\nAfter Ratt broke up, DeMartini had a short stint with the band [[Dokken]] before briefly becoming a touring guitarist for [[hard rock]] band [[Whitesnake]] in 1994. After that, he released two solo projects; the EP, ''Surf's Up!'' in 1995, and his only full-length album to date, ''Crazy Enough To Sing To You'' in 1996. Ratt re-united in 1996 and released two albums, [[Collage (Ratt album)|Collage]] in July 1997, and a [[Ratt (album)|self-titled album]] in July 1999, which was a critical and commercial failure. In 2003, DeMartini was hired to replace guitarist [[Doug Aldrich]] in the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] but after several rehearsals he decided to leave the band due to musical differences with band leader [[Ronnie James Dio]]. Ratt reformed again in 2007 and began a tour in the summer of that year. In March of 2018, it was widely rumored that DeMartini had lost interest with continuing forward with Ratt due to ongoing problems within the band.

The family later relocated to San Diego. DeMartini became interested in [[Rock and roll|rock music]] due to the influence of his older brothers Bernard and James, whose band rehearsed in the family basement. His grandmother was also a musician of note, playing piano accompaniment to silent movies in [[Preston, Minnesota]].\n\nDeMartini's mother bought him a guitar at his request when he was \"around seven or eight years old\". According to Warren, he struggled early on learning to play it due to the tuning pegs being cheap, causing the instrument to constantly fall out of tune. As a result, he became frustrated and smashed the instrument as he had seen [[Pete Townshend]] of [[the Who]] do onstage. As a result, that was the last guitar he would receive as a gift. At age 14, he had to get himself a job in order to raise the money to purchase a new electric guitar, a [[Cimar]] [[Les Paul guitar|Les Paul]] copy. The first song DeMartini learned was [[Sunshine of Your Love]] by [[Cream (band)|Cream]], which he learned by ear.<ref name=\"guitarworld.com\"/>\n\nWarren played his first concert with his band the Plague in front of a small crowd at San Diego's [[La Jolla High School]] at the age of 15. By this time he was emerging as one of the San Diego area's most talented and sought-after young guitar players. The first year he signed up, he won \"Best New Guitar Player in San Diego\" at ''Guitar Trader'' on Clairemont Mesa Blvd. He graduated from high school in 1981. DeMartini began taking classes at a local college, but in the first semester was invited up to Los Angeles to join Mickey Ratt; the band that would eventually become the highly successful 1980s metal band, [[Ratt]].<ref>[http://innocentwords.com/warren-demartini-laying-it-down-since-83/] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ratt==\n{{Main|Ratt}}\nDeMartini replaced [[Jake E.
