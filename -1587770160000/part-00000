They saw this as a way to prevent Dalmatia being ceded to Italy under the [[Treaty of London (1915)]]. In 1918, the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] sent a delegation to the Serbian monarch to offer unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].\n\nThe leader of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], warned on their departure for Belgrade that the council had no democratic legitimacy. But a new state, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], was duly proclaimed on 1 December 1918, with no heed taken of legal protocols such as the signing of a new ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]]'' in recognition of historic Croatian state rights.<ref>Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: ''Ljetopis Jugoslavenske akademije'', Vol.49 (Zagreb 1936) p. 279</ref><ref>Srdja Trifkovic: ''Usta\u0161a'', Lord Byron Foundation for Balkan Studies (London 1998)<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nCroats were at the outset politically disadvantaged with the centralized political structure of the kingdom, which was seen as favouring the Serb majority. The political situation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was fractious and violent. In 1927, the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]], which represented the [[Serbs of Croatia]], turned its back on the centralist policy of King Alexander.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 20 June 1928, Stjepan Radi\u0107 and four other Croat deputies were shot while in the Belgrade parliament by a member of the [[People's Radical Party|Serbian People's Radical Party]]. Three of the deputies, including Radi\u0107, died. The outrage that resulted from the [[assassination of Stjepan Radi\u0107]] threatened to destabilise the kingdom.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn January 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] responded by proclaiming a royal dictatorship, under which all dissenting political activity was banned and renaming the state the \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\". The [[Usta\u0161a]] was created in principle in 1929.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOne consequence of Alexander's 1929 proclamation and the repression and persecution of Croatian nationalists was a rise of support for the Croatian extreme nationalist, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], who had been a Zagreb deputy in the Yugoslav parliament, He was later implicated in Alexander's assassination in 1934, went into exile in Italy and gained support for his vision of liberating Croatia from Serb control and racially \"purifying\" Croatia.

Meanwhile, Mussolini used his long-established support for Croatian independence as leverage to coerce Paveli\u0107 into signing an agreement on 19 May 1941, under which central [[Dalmatia]] and parts of [[Hrvatsko primorje]] and [[Gorski kotar]] were ceded to Italy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765632,00.html|title=Foreign News: Crown of Zvonimir|work=TIME|date=26 May 1941|accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nUnder the same agreement, the NDH was restricted to a minimal [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] and Italian forces were granted military control of the entire [[Geography of Croatia#Adriatic Basin|Croatian coastline]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] was also openly supportive of the government. According to Ma\u010dek, the new state was greeted with a \"wave of enthusiasm\" in Zagreb, often by people \"blinded and intoxicated\" by the fact that the Nazi Germany had \"gift-wrapped their occupation under the euphemistic title of ''Independent State of Croatia''\". But in the villages, Ma\u010dek wrote, the [[peasant]]ry believed that \"their struggle over the past 30 years to become masters of their homes and their country had suffered a tremendous setback\".<ref>Ma\u010dek, pp. 220\u201331</ref>\n\n[[File:\u017didovi izlo\u017eba ndh 1942.jpg|thumb|right|190px|An antisemitic poster in Zagreb]]\n\nOn 16 August 1941, the [[Ustasha Surveillance Service]] was established, consisting of four departments, the ''Ustasha Police'', the ''Ustasha Intelligence Service'', ''Ustasha Defense'', and ''Personnel'', for the suppression of activities against the Ustasha, the Independent State of Croatia, and the Croatia people. The Service was eliminated as a separate agency in January 1943 and functions were transferred to the Ministry of Interior under the ''Directorate of Public Order''.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=341}}\n\nDissatisfied with the Paveli\u0107 regime in its early months, the Axis Powers in September 1941 asked Ma\u010dek to take over, but Ma\u010dek again refused. Perceiving Ma\u010dek as a potential rival, Paveli\u0107 subsequently had him arrested and interred in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. The Usta\u0161e initially did not have an army or administration capable of controlling all the territory of the NDH. The Usta\u0161e movement had fewer than 12,000 members when the war started. While the Usta\u0161e's own estimates put the number of their sympathizers even in the early phase at around 40,000.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch|Pavlowitch, 2008]] {{page needed|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{History of Croatia}}\nTo act against Serbs and Jews with genocidal measures, the Ustase introduced widespread measures that Croats themselves were victim to. Jozo Tomasevich in his book, ''War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941-1945'', states, ''\"never before in history had Croats been exposed to such legalized administrative, police and judicial brutality and abuse as during the Ustasha regime.\"'' Decrees enacted by the regime allowed it to get rid of all 'unwanted' employees in state and local government and in state enterprises. The 'unwanted' (being all Jews, Serbs, and Yugoslav-oriented Croats) were all thrown out except for some deemed specifically needed by the government. This left a multitude of jobs to be filled by Ustashas and pro-Ustasha adherents and led to government jobs being filled by people with no professional qualifications.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=381-382}}\n\n===Italian influence===\n[[File:Mussolini and Pavelic 1941.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Pavelic]] (left) with Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] (right) in Rome, Italy on 18 May 1941, during the ceremony of Italy's recognition of Croatia as a sovereign state under official Italian protection, and to agree upon Croatia's borders with Italy]]\nMussolini and Ante Paveli\u0107 had close relations prior to the war. Mussolini and Paveli\u0107 both despised the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italy had been promised, in the [[Treaty of London (1915)]], that it would receive Dalmatia from Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. The peace negotiations in 1919, however, influenced by the [[Fourteen Points]] proclaimed by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1856\u20131924), called for national self-determination and determined that the Yugoslavs rightfully deserved the territory in question. Italian nationalists were enraged. Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] raided [[Fiume]] (which held a mixed population of Croats and Italians) and proclaimed it part of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]. D'Annunzio declared himself \"[[Duce]]\" of Carnaro and his [[Blackshirts|blackshirted]] revolutionaries held control over the town. D'Annunzio was known for engaging in passionate speeches aimed to draw Croatian nationalists to support his actions and to oppose Yugoslavia.<ref>Bosworth, Richard J.B. ''Mussolini's Italy'' (2005). New Work: Allen Lane. pp. 112\u201313.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nCroatian nationalists, such as Paveli\u0107, opposed the border changes that occurred after World War I. Not only was D'Annunzio's symbolism copied by Mussolini but also D'Annunzio's appeal to Croatian support for the dismantling of Yugoslavia, as a foreign policy approach to Yugoslavia by Mussolini. Paveli\u0107 had been in negotiations with Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia.<ref>Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer (ed.). ''Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe''. Purdue University Press, 2007, p. 210.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, upon Paveli\u0107 and the Usta\u0161e being forced into exile by the Yugoslav government, they were offered sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini, who allowed them to use training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia. In exchange for this support, Mussolini demanded that Paveli\u0107 agree that [[Dalmatia]] would become part of Italy if Italy and the Usta\u0161e successfully waged war on Yugoslavia. Although Dalmatia was a largely Croat-populated territory, it had been part of various Italian states, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] in prior centuries and was part of [[Italian nationalism]]'s irredentist claims.\n\nIn exchange for this concession, Mussolini offered Paveli\u0107 the right for Croatia to annex all of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which had only a minority Croat population. Paveli\u0107 agreed. After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous [[List of islands in the Adriatic|Adriatic islands]] and a portion of [[Dalmatia]], which all combined to become the Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] including territory from the provinces of [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Zadar]], and [[Kotor]].<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno 2006.

Pp. 80-81\"/>\n\nItaly intended to keep the NDH within its sphere of influence by forbidding it to build any significant navy.<ref name=\"Tanner-p147\"/> Italy only permitted small patrol boats to be used by NDH forces. This policy forbidding the creation of NDH warships was part of the Italian Fascists' policy of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (Latin for \"Our Sea\") in which Italy was to dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as the [[Roman Empire]] had done centuries earlier. Italian armed forces assisted the Usta\u0161e government in persecuting Serbs.

This would appease Nazi Germany's ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims. Germany's position on Croatia changed after its [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia#Armistice and surrender|capture of Yugoslavia]]. Military forces from other Axis powers, including [[Royal Italian Army (1940\u201346)|Italy]], [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungary]], and [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]] made few gains during the invasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the [[Military history of Greece during World War II|Greek armed forces]]. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single-handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy's military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Usta\u0161e and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy's planned territorial gains. Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Paveli\u0107 prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims.\n\nHitler sparred with his army commanders over what policy should be undertaken in Croatia regarding the Serbs. German military officials thought that Serbs could be rallied to fight against the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Hitler disagreed with his commanders, but pointed out to Paveli\u0107 that the NDH could create a completely Croat state only if it followed a constant policy of persecution of the non-Croat population for at least fifty years.<ref name=\"Tanner-p147\"/>\n\nAs early as 10 July 1941, Wehrmacht General [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau|Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]] reported the following to the German High Command, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW):{{quote|Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation&nbsp;...

In early 1942 Chetnik Major [[Jezdimir Dangi\u0107]] approached the Germans in an attempt to arrive at an understanding, but was unsuccessful, and the local Chetnik leaders were forced to look for another solution. The Chetnik groups were in fundamental disagreement with the Usta\u0161e on practically all issues, but they found a common enemy in the Partisans, and this was the overriding reason for the collaboration which ensued between the [[Usta\u0161e]] authorities of the Independent State of Croatia and Chetnik detachments in Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe first formal agreement between Bosnian Chetniks and the [[Usta\u0161e]] was concluded on 28 May 1942, in which Chetnik leaders expressed their loyalty as \"citizens of the Independent State of Croatia\" both to the state and its Poglavnik ([[Ante Paveli\u0107]]). During the next three weeks, three additional agreements were signed, covering a large part of the area of Bosnia (along with the Chetnik detachments within it). By the provision of these agreements, the Chetniks were to cease hostilities against the Usta\u0161e state, and the Usta\u0161e would establish regular administration in these areas.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=40}} The main provision, Article 5 of the agreement, states as follows:<blockquote>As long as there is danger from the Partisan armed bands, the Chetnik formations will cooperate voluntarily with the Croatian military in fighting and destroying the Partisans and in those operations they will be under the overall command of the Croatian armed forces.&nbsp;... Chetnik formations may engage in operations against the Partisans on their own, but this they will have to report, on time, to the Croatian military commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}</blockquote>\n\nThe necessary ammunition and provisions were supplied to the Chetniks by the Usta\u0161e military. Chetniks who were wounded in such operations would be cared for in NDH hospitals, while the orphans and widows of Chetniks killed in action would be supported by the Usta\u0161e state. Persons specifically recommended by Chetnik commanders would be returned home from the Usta\u0161e concentration camps. These agreements covered the majority of Chetnik forces in Bosnia east of the German-Italian demarcation line, and lasted throughout most of the war. Since Croatian forces were immediately subordinate to the German military occupation, collaboration with Croatian forces was, in fact, indirect collaboration with the Germans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=40}}\n\n===End of the war===\nIn August 1944, there was an attempt by the NDH Foreign [[Political minister|Minister]] [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]] and Minister of War [[Ante Voki\u0107]] to execute a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Ante Paveli\u0107. The [[Lorkovi\u0107-Voki\u0107 coup]] failed and its conspirators were executed. By early 1945, the NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] troops. They were overpowered and the advance of Tito's Partisan forces, joined by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]], caused a mass retreat of the Usta\u0161e towards Austria and effectively an end to the Independent State of Croatia.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn May 1945, a large column composed of NDH Home Guard troops, Usta\u0161a, Cossacks, some Chetniks and the [[Slovene Home Guard]], as well as numerous civilians, retreated from the Partisan forces heading northwest towards Italy and Austria. The [[German Instrument of Surrender]] was signed on 8 May, but the Germans put Paveli\u0107 in sole command of NDH forces, and he ordered to continue fighting as the columns tried to reach the British forces to negotiate passage into [[Allied-occupied Austria]]. The British Army, however, refused them entry and turned them over to the Partisan forces, starting the [[Bleiburg repatriations]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ante Paveli\u0107 had detached from the group and fled to Austria, Italy, [[Argentina]] and finally Spain, where he would die in 1959.

The unit was sent to Germany for training on 15 July 1941 before heading to the Eastern Front. Many of the pilots and crews had previously served in the [[Royal Yugoslav Air Force]] during the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941. Some of them also had experience in the two main types that they would operate, the [[Messerschmitt 109]] and [[Dornier Do 17]], with two fighter pilots having actually shot down [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft.<ref>Savic, D. and Ciglic, B.

Upon return to Croatia from December 1942, the unit's aircraft proved a strong addition to the strike power of the Axis forces fighting the Partisans right up to the end of 1944.<ref>Lisko, et al., 1998, p. 34.</ref>\n\nBecause of low morale among army conscripts and their increasing disaffection with the Usta\u0161a regime as the war progressed, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] came to regard them as a key element in their supply line. According to William Deakin, who led one of the British missions to the Partisan commander-in-chief [[Josip Broz Tito]], in some areas, Partisans would release army soldiers after disarming them, so they could come back into the field with replacement weapons, which would again be seized.<ref>Deakin, FWD.

Army troop numbers dwindled from 130,000 in early 1943 to 70,000 by late 1944, at which point the NDH government amalgamated the army with the Usta\u0161e army and was organised into eighteen divisions, including artillery and armoured units.<ref>[[#Tomasevich-OaC|Tomasevich, 2001]], p. 459</ref> Despite these difficulties, the army, along with the German-commanded XV [[Cossack]] Corps, was able to assist the [[Wehrmacht]] to hold its lines in [[Syrmia]], [[Slavonia]] and [[Bosnia]] against the combined [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], Bulgarian and Partisan offensives from late 1944 to shortly before the NDH collapse in May 1945.\n\nThe [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British [[Royal Air Force]], [[United States Air Force]] and the [[Soviet Air Force]].

Around 20% of state's industrial enterprises accounted for wood industry. However, as the war progressed, industrial production in the territory of NDH was constantly decreasing, while inflation continued growing.<ref name=Matkovic/>\n\nIn 1942, 80% of NDH exports went to Germany (including Austria, [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the Polish [[General Government]]) and 12% to Italy. Germany covered 70% of imports, while Italy covered 25%. Other trade partners included Hungary, Romania, Finland, Serbia and Switzerland. Exports from NDH mainly consisted of lumber and wood products, agricultural products (including tobacco), livestock, ore, and strategically important bauxite. NDH mostly imported machinery, tools and other metal products, textiles and fuel.<ref name=Tomasevic/>\n\n===Influences of Nazi Germany===\nIn the Independent State of Croatia, which Nazi Germany formally treated as a sovereign state, most, if not all, industrial and economic activity was either monopolized, or given a high priority for exploitation, by Germany. Agreements between the two governments in mid-1941 regulated foreign trade and payments and the export of Croatian labour to Germany. Germany already controlled a large number of industrial and mining enterprises in Croatia that were owned in part or in full by German citizens or citizens of German-occupied countries. Many other enterprises in Croatia, especially in the bauxite mining and timber industries, were leased to the Germans for the duration of the war. The Germans also held large interests in Croatian commercial banks, exercised either directly by banks in Berlin and [[Vienna]], or indirectly, by German banks that had large interests in [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]] banks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=621}}\n\nFrom the beginning, the Germans showed great interest in the high-quality iron ore mines of Ljubija in northwest [[Bosnia]], in the industrial complex (steel, coal and heavy chemicals) in the [[Sarajevo]]\u2013[[Tuzla]]\u2013[[Zenica]] triangle in northeast Bosnia, and in bauxite. As the war advanced and German military involvement in Croatia expanded, more and more Croatian industry was put to work for the Germans. The bauxite mines in [[Hercegovina]], [[Dalmatia]] and western [[Bosnia]], were in the Italian zone of occupation, but their total production was earmarked for German needs for the duration of the war under the German-Italian agreement of 1941.<ref>Tomasevich, p. 641</ref>\n\nOther Croatian industrial assets utilized by the Germans included the production of brown coal and [[lignite]], cement (major plants in [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]), oil and salt. Crude oil production, from fields to the east of Zagreb developed by the American Vacuum Oil Company, only started in November 1941 and never reached a high level, averaging {{convert|24000|oilbbl}} a month in mid-1944. The most important commodities manufactured in Croatia for German use were prefabricated barracks (utilizing the large Croatian timber industry), clothing, dry-cell batteries, bridge construction parts and ammunition (grenades).\n\nThe [[Vare\u0161]] iron ore mine supplied the steel mill at Zenica, which had a capacity of 120,000 tons of steel annually. The Zenica mill, in turn, supplied the state arsenal in Sarajevo and the machinery and railroad car factory in [[Slavonski Brod]], both of which produced various items for the [[Wehrmacht]] during the war, including grenades and shell casings. Some Vare\u0161 iron ore was also exported to Italy, Hungary and [[Romania]].<ref>Tomasevich, p. 646</ref>\n\n===Italian influence===\nThe region of the NDH controlled by Italy had few natural resources and little industry.{{Dubious|date=September 2011}} There were some important timber stands, several cement plants, an aluminium plant at Lozovac, a carbide and chemical fertilizer plant at Dugi Rat, and a ferromanganese and cast iron plant near [[\u0160ibenik]], ship building operations in Split, a few brown coal mines supplying fuel to railways, shipping and industry, and rich bauxite fields.<ref>Tomasevich, p. 660</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===Population===\nAccording to data calculated by the [[German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during the creation of the state, the population was approximately 6,285,000 of which 3,300,000 were [[Croats]], 1,925,000 were [[Serbs]], 700,000 were [[Bosniaks|Muslims]], 150,000 [[Germans of Yugoslavia|Germans]], 65,000 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], 40,000 Jews, and 30,000 [[Slovenes]].

The NDH had to accept more than 200,000 [[Slovenia]]n refugees who were forcefully evicted from their homes as part of the German plan of annexing parts of the Slovenian territories. As part of this deal, the Usta\u0161e were to deport 200,000 Serbs from Croatia military regions; however, only 182,000 had been deported when German high commander Bader stopped this mass transport of people because of the uprising of Chetniks and partisans in [[Serbia]]. An estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from NDH to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=114}} \n\nInternal colonization to the region of [[Slavonia]] was encouraged during this period from [[Dalmatia]], [[Lika]], [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

They saw this as a way to prevent Dalmatia being ceded to Italy under the [[Treaty of London (1915)]]. In 1918, the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] sent a delegation to the Serbian monarch to offer unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].\n\nThe leader of the [[Croatian Peasant Party]], [[Stjepan Radi\u0107]], warned on their departure for Belgrade that the council had no democratic legitimacy. But a new state, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], was duly proclaimed on 1 December 1918, with no heed taken of legal protocols such as the signing of a new ''[[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]]'' in recognition of historic Croatian state rights.<ref>Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: ''Ljetopis Jugoslavenske akademije'', Vol.49 (Zagreb 1936) p. 279</ref><ref>Srdja Trifkovic: ''Usta\u0161a'', Lord Byron Foundation for Balkan Studies (London 1998)<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nCroats were at the outset politically disadvantaged with the centralized political structure of the kingdom, which was seen as favouring the Serb majority. The political situation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was fractious and violent. In 1927, the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]], which represented the [[Serbs of Croatia]], turned its back on the centralist policy of King Alexander.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nOn 20 June 1928, Stjepan Radi\u0107 and four other Croat deputies were shot while in the Belgrade parliament by a member of the [[People's Radical Party|Serbian People's Radical Party]]. Three of the deputies, including Radi\u0107, died. The outrage that resulted from the [[assassination of Stjepan Radi\u0107]] threatened to destabilise the kingdom.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn January 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] responded by proclaiming a royal dictatorship, under which all dissenting political activity was banned and renaming the state the \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\". The [[Usta\u0161a]] was created in principle in 1929.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOne consequence of Alexander's 1929 proclamation and the repression and persecution of Croatian nationalists was a rise of support for the Croatian extreme nationalist, [[Ante Paveli\u0107]], who had been a Zagreb deputy in the Yugoslav parliament, He was later implicated in Alexander's assassination in 1934, went into exile in Italy and gained support for his vision of liberating Croatia from Serb control and racially \"purifying\" Croatia.

Meanwhile, Mussolini used his long-established support for Croatian independence as leverage to coerce Paveli\u0107 into signing an agreement on 19 May 1941, under which central [[Dalmatia]] and parts of [[Hrvatsko primorje]] and [[Gorski kotar]] were ceded to Italy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765632,00.html|title=Foreign News: Crown of Zvonimir|work=TIME|date=26 May 1941|accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nUnder the same agreement, the NDH was restricted to a minimal [[Navy of the Independent State of Croatia|navy]] and Italian forces were granted military control of the entire [[Geography of Croatia#Adriatic Basin|Croatian coastline]].

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] was also openly supportive of the government. According to Ma\u010dek, the new state was greeted with a \"wave of enthusiasm\" in Zagreb, often by people \"blinded and intoxicated\" by the fact that the Nazi Germany had \"gift-wrapped their occupation under the euphemistic title of ''Independent State of Croatia''\". But in the villages, Ma\u010dek wrote, the [[peasant]]ry believed that \"their struggle over the past 30 years to become masters of their homes and their country had suffered a tremendous setback\".<ref>Ma\u010dek, pp. 220\u201331</ref>\n\n[[File:\u017didovi izlo\u017eba ndh 1942.jpg|thumb|right|190px|An antisemitic poster in Zagreb]]\n\nOn 16 August 1941, the [[Ustasha Surveillance Service]] was established, consisting of four departments, the ''Ustasha Police'', the ''Ustasha Intelligence Service'', ''Ustasha Defense'', and ''Personnel'', for the suppression of activities against the Ustasha, the Independent State of Croatia, and the Croatia people. The Service was eliminated as a separate agency in January 1943 and functions were transferred to the Ministry of Interior under the ''Directorate of Public Order''.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=341}}\n\nDissatisfied with the Paveli\u0107 regime in its early months, the Axis Powers in September 1941 asked Ma\u010dek to take over, but Ma\u010dek again refused. Perceiving Ma\u010dek as a potential rival, Paveli\u0107 subsequently had him arrested and interred in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]. The Usta\u0161e initially did not have an army or administration capable of controlling all the territory of the NDH. The Usta\u0161e movement had fewer than 12,000 members when the war started. While the Usta\u0161e's own estimates put the number of their sympathizers even in the early phase at around 40,000.<ref>[[#Pavlowitch|Pavlowitch, 2008]] {{page needed|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{History of Croatia}}\nTo act against Serbs and Jews with genocidal measures, the Ustase introduced widespread measures that Croats themselves were victim to. Jozo Tomasevich in his book, ''War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941-1945'', states, ''\"never before in history had Croats been exposed to such legalized administrative, police and judicial brutality and abuse as during the Ustasha regime.\"'' Decrees enacted by the regime allowed it to get rid of all 'unwanted' employees in state and local government and in state enterprises. The 'unwanted' (being all Jews, Serbs, and Yugoslav-oriented Croats) were all thrown out except for some deemed specifically needed by the government. This left a multitude of jobs to be filled by Ustashas and pro-Ustasha adherents and led to government jobs being filled by people with no professional qualifications.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=381-382}}\n\n===Italian influence===\n[[File:Mussolini and Pavelic 1941.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Pavelic]] (left) with Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] (right) in Rome, Italy on 18 May 1941, during the ceremony of Italy's recognition of Croatia as a sovereign state under official Italian protection, and to agree upon Croatia's borders with Italy]]\nMussolini and Ante Paveli\u0107 had close relations prior to the war. Mussolini and Paveli\u0107 both despised the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italy had been promised, in the [[Treaty of London (1915)]], that it would receive Dalmatia from Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. The peace negotiations in 1919, however, influenced by the [[Fourteen Points]] proclaimed by US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1856\u20131924), called for national self-determination and determined that the Yugoslavs rightfully deserved the territory in question. Italian nationalists were enraged. Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] raided [[Fiume]] (which held a mixed population of Croats and Italians) and proclaimed it part of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]. D'Annunzio declared himself \"[[Duce]]\" of Carnaro and his [[Blackshirts|blackshirted]] revolutionaries held control over the town. D'Annunzio was known for engaging in passionate speeches aimed to draw Croatian nationalists to support his actions and to oppose Yugoslavia.<ref>Bosworth, Richard J.B. ''Mussolini's Italy'' (2005). New Work: Allen Lane. pp. 112\u201313.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nCroatian nationalists, such as Paveli\u0107, opposed the border changes that occurred after World War I. Not only was D'Annunzio's symbolism copied by Mussolini but also D'Annunzio's appeal to Croatian support for the dismantling of Yugoslavia, as a foreign policy approach to Yugoslavia by Mussolini. Paveli\u0107 had been in negotiations with Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia.<ref>Bernd J\u00fcrgen Fischer (ed.). ''Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe''. Purdue University Press, 2007, p. 210.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, upon Paveli\u0107 and the Usta\u0161e being forced into exile by the Yugoslav government, they were offered sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini, who allowed them to use training grounds to prepare for war against Yugoslavia. In exchange for this support, Mussolini demanded that Paveli\u0107 agree that [[Dalmatia]] would become part of Italy if Italy and the Usta\u0161e successfully waged war on Yugoslavia. Although Dalmatia was a largely Croat-populated territory, it had been part of various Italian states, such as the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] in prior centuries and was part of [[Italian nationalism]]'s irredentist claims.\n\nIn exchange for this concession, Mussolini offered Paveli\u0107 the right for Croatia to annex all of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which had only a minority Croat population. Paveli\u0107 agreed. After the invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, Italy annexed numerous [[List of islands in the Adriatic|Adriatic islands]] and a portion of [[Dalmatia]], which all combined to become the Italian [[Governorship of Dalmatia]] including territory from the provinces of [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Zadar]], and [[Kotor]].<ref name=\"Davide Rodogno 2006.

Pp. 80-81\"/>\n\nItaly intended to keep the NDH within its sphere of influence by forbidding it to build any significant navy.<ref name=\"Tanner-p147\"/> Italy only permitted small patrol boats to be used by NDH forces. This policy forbidding the creation of NDH warships was part of the Italian Fascists' policy of ''[[Mare Nostrum]]'' (Latin for \"Our Sea\") in which Italy was to dominate the [[Mediterranean Sea]] as the [[Roman Empire]] had done centuries earlier. Italian armed forces assisted the Usta\u0161e government in persecuting Serbs. In 1941, Italian forces captured and interned the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] [[Bishop Irinej]] of [[Dalmatia]].<ref name=\"Tanner-p151\">Tanner, p. 151</ref>\n\n===Influence of Nazi Germany===\n[[File:Adolf Hitler meets Ante Paveli\u0107.1941.jpg|thumb|left|Germany's ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]] (left) with ''Poglavnik'' Ante Paveli\u0107 (right) at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], outside the [[Berchtesgaden]], Germany]]\nAt the time of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, [[Adolf Hitler]] was uneasy with Mussolini's agenda of creating a puppet Croatian state, and preferred that areas outside of Italian territorial aims become part of [[Hungary in World War II|Hungary]] as an autonomous territory. This would appease Nazi Germany's ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims. Germany's position on Croatia changed after its [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia#Armistice and surrender|capture of Yugoslavia]]. Military forces from other Axis powers, including [[Royal Italian Army (1940\u201346)|Italy]], [[Royal Hungarian Army|Hungary]], and [[Military history of Bulgaria during World War II|Bulgaria]] made few gains during the invasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the [[Military history of Greece during World War II|Greek armed forces]]. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single-handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy's military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Usta\u0161e and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy's planned territorial gains. Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Paveli\u0107 prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims.\n\nHitler sparred with his army commanders over what policy should be undertaken in Croatia regarding the Serbs. German military officials thought that Serbs could be rallied to fight against the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]]. Hitler disagreed with his commanders, but pointed out to Paveli\u0107 that the NDH could create a completely Croat state only if it followed a constant policy of persecution of the non-Croat population for at least fifty years.<ref name=\"Tanner-p147\"/>\n\nAs early as 10 July 1941, Wehrmacht General [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau|Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]] reported the following to the German High Command, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW):{{quote|Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation&nbsp;...

The Partisan movement was soon able to control a large percentage of the NDH (and Yugoslavia) and before long the cities of occupied [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] in particular were surrounded by these Partisan-controlled areas, with their garrisons living in a ''de facto'' state of siege and constantly trying to maintain control of the rail-links.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 1944, the third year of the war in Yugoslavia, Croats formed 61% of the Partisan operational units originating from the [[Federal State of Croatia]].<ref name=strugar>{{cite book|last=Strugar|first=Vlado|title=Jugoslavija 1941\u20131945|publisher= Vojnoizdava\u010dki zavod|year=1969}}</ref><ref name=anic>{{cite book|last1=Ani\u0107|first1=Nikola|last2= Joksimovi\u0107|first2=Sekula|last3=Guti\u0107|first3=Mirko|title=Narodnooslobodila\u010dka vojska Jugoslavije| publisher=Vojnoistorijski institut|year=1982}}</ref><ref name=vukovic>{{cite book|last1=Vukovi\u0107| first1=Bo\u017eidar|last2=Vidakovi\u0107|first2=Josip|title=Putevim Glavnog \u0161taba Hrvatske|year=1976}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Federal State of Croatia]] also had the highest number of detachments and brigades {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} among the federal units, and together with the forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Partisan resistance in the NDH made up the majority of the movement's military strength.

In early 1942 Chetnik Major [[Jezdimir Dangi\u0107]] approached the Germans in an attempt to arrive at an understanding, but was unsuccessful, and the local Chetnik leaders were forced to look for another solution. The Chetnik groups were in fundamental disagreement with the Usta\u0161e on practically all issues, but they found a common enemy in the Partisans, and this was the overriding reason for the collaboration which ensued between the [[Usta\u0161e]] authorities of the Independent State of Croatia and Chetnik detachments in Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe first formal agreement between Bosnian Chetniks and the [[Usta\u0161e]] was concluded on 28 May 1942, in which Chetnik leaders expressed their loyalty as \"citizens of the Independent State of Croatia\" both to the state and its Poglavnik ([[Ante Paveli\u0107]]). During the next three weeks, three additional agreements were signed, covering a large part of the area of Bosnia (along with the Chetnik detachments within it). By the provision of these agreements, the Chetniks were to cease hostilities against the Usta\u0161e state, and the Usta\u0161e would establish regular administration in these areas.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=40}} The main provision, Article 5 of the agreement, states as follows:<blockquote>As long as there is danger from the Partisan armed bands, the Chetnik formations will cooperate voluntarily with the Croatian military in fighting and destroying the Partisans and in those operations they will be under the overall command of the Croatian armed forces.&nbsp;... Chetnik formations may engage in operations against the Partisans on their own, but this they will have to report, on time, to the Croatian military commanders.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}</blockquote>\n\nThe necessary ammunition and provisions were supplied to the Chetniks by the Usta\u0161e military. Chetniks who were wounded in such operations would be cared for in NDH hospitals, while the orphans and widows of Chetniks killed in action would be supported by the Usta\u0161e state. Persons specifically recommended by Chetnik commanders would be returned home from the Usta\u0161e concentration camps. These agreements covered the majority of Chetnik forces in Bosnia east of the German-Italian demarcation line, and lasted throughout most of the war. Since Croatian forces were immediately subordinate to the German military occupation, collaboration with Croatian forces was, in fact, indirect collaboration with the Germans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=226}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=40}}\n\n===End of the war===\nIn August 1944, there was an attempt by the NDH Foreign [[Political minister|Minister]] [[Mladen Lorkovi\u0107]] and Minister of War [[Ante Voki\u0107]] to execute a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against Ante Paveli\u0107. The [[Lorkovi\u0107-Voki\u0107 coup]] failed and its conspirators were executed. By early 1945, the NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and [[Cossacks|Cossack]] troops. They were overpowered and the advance of Tito's Partisan forces, joined by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]], caused a mass retreat of the Usta\u0161e towards Austria and effectively an end to the Independent State of Croatia.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn May 1945, a large column composed of NDH Home Guard troops, Usta\u0161a, Cossacks, some Chetniks and the [[Slovene Home Guard]], as well as numerous civilians, retreated from the Partisan forces heading northwest towards Italy and Austria. The [[German Instrument of Surrender]] was signed on 8 May, but the Germans put Paveli\u0107 in sole command of NDH forces, and he ordered to continue fighting as the columns tried to reach the British forces to negotiate passage into [[Allied-occupied Austria]]. The British Army, however, refused them entry and turned them over to the Partisan forces, starting the [[Bleiburg repatriations]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, Ante Paveli\u0107 had detached from the group and fled to Austria, Italy, [[Argentina]] and finally Spain, where he would die in 1959.

Around 20% of state's industrial enterprises accounted for wood industry. However, as the war progressed, industrial production in the territory of NDH was constantly decreasing, while inflation continued growing.<ref name=Matkovic/>\n\nIn 1942, 80% of NDH exports went to Germany (including Austria, [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the Polish [[General Government]]) and 12% to Italy. Germany covered 70% of imports, while Italy covered 25%. Other trade partners included Hungary, Romania, Finland, Serbia and Switzerland. Exports from NDH mainly consisted of lumber and wood products, agricultural products (including tobacco), livestock, ore, and strategically important bauxite. NDH mostly imported machinery, tools and other metal products, textiles and fuel.<ref name=Tomasevic/>\n\n===Influences of Nazi Germany===\nIn the Independent State of Croatia, which Nazi Germany formally treated as a sovereign state, most, if not all, industrial and economic activity was either monopolized, or given a high priority for exploitation, by Germany. Agreements between the two governments in mid-1941 regulated foreign trade and payments and the export of Croatian labour to Germany. Germany already controlled a large number of industrial and mining enterprises in Croatia that were owned in part or in full by German citizens or citizens of German-occupied countries. Many other enterprises in Croatia, especially in the bauxite mining and timber industries, were leased to the Germans for the duration of the war. The Germans also held large interests in Croatian commercial banks, exercised either directly by banks in Berlin and [[Vienna]], or indirectly, by German banks that had large interests in [[Prague]] and [[Budapest]] banks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=621}}\n\nFrom the beginning, the Germans showed great interest in the high-quality iron ore mines of Ljubija in northwest [[Bosnia]], in the industrial complex (steel, coal and heavy chemicals) in the [[Sarajevo]]\u2013[[Tuzla]]\u2013[[Zenica]] triangle in northeast Bosnia, and in bauxite. As the war advanced and German military involvement in Croatia expanded, more and more Croatian industry was put to work for the Germans. The bauxite mines in [[Hercegovina]], [[Dalmatia]] and western [[Bosnia]], were in the Italian zone of occupation, but their total production was earmarked for German needs for the duration of the war under the German-Italian agreement of 1941.<ref>Tomasevich, p. 641</ref>\n\nOther Croatian industrial assets utilized by the Germans included the production of brown coal and [[lignite]], cement (major plants in [[Zagreb]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]), oil and salt. Crude oil production, from fields to the east of Zagreb developed by the American Vacuum Oil Company, only started in November 1941 and never reached a high level, averaging {{convert|24000|oilbbl}} a month in mid-1944. The most important commodities manufactured in Croatia for German use were prefabricated barracks (utilizing the large Croatian timber industry), clothing, dry-cell batteries, bridge construction parts and ammunition (grenades).\n\nThe [[Vare\u0161]] iron ore mine supplied the steel mill at Zenica, which had a capacity of 120,000 tons of steel annually. The Zenica mill, in turn, supplied the state arsenal in Sarajevo and the machinery and railroad car factory in [[Slavonski Brod]], both of which produced various items for the [[Wehrmacht]] during the war, including grenades and shell casings. Some Vare\u0161 iron ore was also exported to Italy, Hungary and [[Romania]].<ref>Tomasevich, p. 646</ref>\n\n===Italian influence===\nThe region of the NDH controlled by Italy had few natural resources and little industry.{{Dubious|date=September 2011}} There were some important timber stands, several cement plants, an aluminium plant at Lozovac, a carbide and chemical fertilizer plant at Dugi Rat, and a ferromanganese and cast iron plant near [[\u0160ibenik]], ship building operations in Split, a few brown coal mines supplying fuel to railways, shipping and industry, and rich bauxite fields.<ref>Tomasevich, p. 660</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===Population===\nAccording to data calculated by the [[German Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] during the creation of the state, the population was approximately 6,285,000 of which 3,300,000 were [[Croats]], 1,925,000 were [[Serbs]], 700,000 were [[Bosniaks|Muslims]], 150,000 [[Germans of Yugoslavia|Germans]], 65,000 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], 40,000 Jews, and 30,000 [[Slovenes]]. Croats comprised slightly over half of the population of the Independent State of Croatia. With Muslims treated as Croats, the Croat share of the total population was still less than two-thirds.<ref name=\"hoare\">{{cite book|last=Hoare|first=Marko Attila|title=Genocide and Resistance in Hitler's Bosnia: The Partisans and the Chetniks|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-726380-1|pages=19\u201320}}</ref>\n\n===Displacement of people===\nA large number of people were displaced due to the internal fighting within Yugoslavia. The NDH had to accept more than 200,000 [[Slovenia]]n refugees who were forcefully evicted from their homes as part of the German plan of annexing parts of the Slovenian territories. As part of this deal, the Usta\u0161e were to deport 200,000 Serbs from Croatia military regions; however, only 182,000 had been deported when German high commander Bader stopped this mass transport of people because of the uprising of Chetniks and partisans in [[Serbia]]. An estimated 120,000 Serbs were deported from NDH to German-occupied Serbia, and 300,000 fled by 1943.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=114}} \n\nInternal colonization to the region of [[Slavonia]] was encouraged during this period from [[Dalmatia]], [[Lika]], [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
