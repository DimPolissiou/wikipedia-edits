The [[Parareptilia]] and [[synapsid]] amniotes were common during the late [[Paleozoic]], while [[diapsid]]s became dominant during the [[Mesozoic]]. In the sea, the [[bony fishes]] became dominant. [[Birds]], a derived form of [[dinosaurs|dinosaur]], evolved in the [[Jurassic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Cloudsley-Thompson|first=J.

Fishes of myriad varieties are the main predators in most of the world's water bodies, both freshwater and marine. The rest of the vertebrate species are tetrapods, a single lineage that includes amphibians (with roughly 7,000 species); mammals (with approximately 5,500 species); and reptiles and birds (with about 20,000 species divided evenly between the two classes). Tetrapods comprise the dominant megafauna of most terrestrial environments and also include many partially or fully aquatic groups (e.g., sea [[snakes]], penguins, cetaceans).\n\n== Classification ==\nThere are several ways of classifying animals. [[Evolutionary taxonomy|Evolutionary systematics]] relies on [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and [[evolution]]ary history, which is determined through similarities in anatomy and, if possible, the [[genetics]] of organisms. [[Cladistics|Phylogenetic classification]] is based solely on [[phylogeny]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Australian water bugs: their biology and identification (Hemiptera-Heteroptera, Gerromorpha & Nepomorpha)|year=2004|publisher=Apollo Books|isbn=978-87-88757-78-1|author=Andersen, N.M.|author2=Weir, T.A. |page=38}}</ref> Evolutionary systematics gives an overview; phylogenetic systematics gives detail. The two systems are thus complementary rather than opposed.<ref>Hildebran, M.; Gonslow, G. (2001): Analysis of Vertebrate Structure. 5th edition. ''John Wiley & Sons, Inc''. [[New York (state)|New York]], page 33: ''Comment: The problem of naming sister groups''</ref>\n\n=== Traditional classification ===\n[[File:Spindle diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional spindle diagram of the evolution of the vertebrates at class level]]\n\nConventional classification has living vertebrates grouped into seven classes based on traditional interpretations of gross [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[Physiology|physiological]] traits. This classification is the one most commonly encountered in school textbooks, overviews, non-specialist, and popular works. The [[extant taxon|extant]] vertebrates are:<ref name=\"Romer\"/>\n\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n** Class [[Agnatha]] (jawless fishes)\n** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n** Class [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fishes)\n** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians)\n** Class [[Reptilia]] (reptiles)\n** Class [[Aves]] (birds)\n** Class [[Mammalia]] (mammals)\n\nIn addition to these, there are two classes of extinct armoured fishes, the [[Placodermi]] and the [[Acanthodii]].\n\nOther ways of classifying the vertebrates have been devised, particularly with emphasis on the [[phylogeny]] of [[labyrinthodontia|early amphibians]] and reptiles. An example based on Janvier (1981, 1997), Shu ''et al.'' (2003), and Benton (2004)<ref name=\"Benton2004\">{{cite book | last =Benton | first =M.J. | authorlink =Michael Benton | title =Vertebrate Palaeontology | publisher =[[Blackwell Publishing]] | date= 1 November 2004 |edition=Third | location = | pages =33, 455 pp | url =http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/benton/vertclass.html | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0632056378}}</ref> is given here:\n\n\u2020: Extinct\n* '''Subphylum Vertebrata'''\n**''[[Palaeospondylus]]''\n** '''Superclass [[Agnatha]]''' or [[Cephalaspidomorphi]] ([[lamprey]]s and other jawless fishes)\n** '''Infraphylum [[Gnathostomata]]''' (vertebrates with jaws)\n*** Class \u2020[[Placodermi]] (extinct armoured fishes)\n*** Class [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fishes)\n*** Class \u2020[[Acanthodii]] (extinct spiny \"sharks\")\n*** '''Superclass [[Osteichthyes]]''' (bony vertebrates)\n**** Class [[Actinopterygii]] (ray-finned bony fishes)\n**** Class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fishes, including the tetrapods)\n**** Class [[Amphibia]] (amphibians, some ancestral to the [[amniotes]])\u2014now a paraphyletic group\n**** Class [[Synapsida]] (mammals and the extinct mammal-like reptiles)\n**** Class [[Sauropsida]] (reptiles and birds)\n\nWhile this traditional classification is orderly, most of the groups are [[paraphyletic]], i.e. do not contain all descendants of the class's common ancestor.<ref name=Benton2004 /> For instance, descendants of the first reptiles include modern reptiles as well as mammals and birds; the [[agnatha]]ns have given rise to the [[Gnathostomata|jawed vertebrates]]; the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]] have given rise to the [[tetrapoda|land vertebrates]]; the traditional \"[[Labyrinthodont|amphibians]]\" have given rise to the [[Reptilia|reptiles]] (traditionally including the [[synapsid]]s or mammal-like \"reptiles\"), which in turn have given rise to the mammals and birds. Most scientists working with vertebrates use a classification based purely on [[phylogeny]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}, organized by their known evolutionary history and sometimes disregarding the conventional interpretations of their anatomy and physiology.\n\n=== Phylogenetic relationships ===\nIn [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic taxonomy]], the relationships between animals are not typically divided into ranks but illustrated as a nested \"family tree\" known as a [[phylogenetic tree]].

He has a B.A. and an M.A. from California State University, Long Beach, and a Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico.  He has taught at various institutions of higher education in southern California, primarily at Long Beach City College and at California State University, Long Beach.\n\n==Early life==\nClifton Snider was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], the second of five sons.  His father, Allan G. Snider, was a minister with the [[Assemblies of God]] denomination.  His mother, Rhoda M. Tout, had traveled as an evangelist with Olga Olsson before her marriage to Allan Snider.  Because the father was a minister, the family moved frequently.  By the age of twelve, Snider had lived in Minnesota; Joliet, Illinois; Terre Haute, Indiana; and several cities in southern California.\n\n==Critic and scholar==\nHe went to Southern California College (an Assemblies of God institution now called [[Vanguard University]]) on music and academic scholarships.  After two years, he transferred to [[California State University, Long Beach]], where he finished his B.A., graduating with honors in 1969, and his M.A. (1971).  He received his Ph.D. in English Literature in 1974 from the [[University of New Mexico]].  Snider's doctoral dissertation is a Jungian analysis of [[Swinburne]]'s ''Tristram of Lyonesse'', and he has published numerous articles on Victorian literature, as well as twentieth century English and American literatures.  These include introductions to Jungian psychology (or [[Analytical Psychology]]) and criticism, histories of [[Merlin]] in 19th-century British literature, as well as such authors as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Edward Lear]], [[Carson McCullers]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. A specialist in Wilde, he has taught his own seminars on him at California State University, Long Beach, and published several articles on Wilde using his primary critical approaches of Jungian and Queer Criticism.  He also taught the first course ever on Gays and Lesbians in Literature at Cal State Long Beach.  His book, ''The Stuff That Dreams Are Made On: A Jungian Interpretation of Literature'', contains a chapter on Wilde.  His latest article uses Jungian and Queer Criticism to examine ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', story and film, and appears in the Jungian journal, ''Psychological Perspectives'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.junginla.org/psychological_perspectives.htm |title=C.G.

In the early 1980s he was a contributing editor for the ''Maelstrom Review''.\n\n==Activism==\nA political/peace activist, Snider has posted poems on the national web site, Poets Against the War,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://poetsagainstthewar.org/displaypoem.asp?AuthorID=314#453073947 |title=Poets Against War |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310034655/http://poetsagainstthewar.org/displaypoem.asp?AuthorID=314#453073947 |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and maintains his own web page, A Poet Against the War,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.csulb.edu/~csnider/Poets_Against_the_War.html|title = A Poet Against the War|first = Clifton|last = Snider}}</ref> on which he has posted some of his own poetry.  The page includes many news items, photos, and links regarding the war in Iraq, not the least of which are statistics of the dead and wounded and information about the slaughter in Iraq of academics and gay people.  He has served as an officer in the Long Beach Lambda Democratic Club.\n\nIn the midst of the presidential election during the fall semester of 2004 at Cal State Long Beach, Snider became involved in a national controversy over [[academic freedom]] when two of his students, a young woman and a young man, went on [[Fox News]] to complain about Snider's comments the first night of a freshman composition class.

Much of his work concerns the foreign places he's visited, and though his home is Long Beach, California, the spiritual core of his poetry is often centered in New Mexico, with its rich mixture of Native, Hispanic, and Anglo cultures.  In New Mexico he has held a number of residence grants at the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation, Taos.  (Other residence grants he has held have been at Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Karolyi Foundation, Vence, France.)  In addition to drawing on his own Christian roots for his work, Snider also draws on a multitude of other religious/spiritual traditions, from Native American to East Indian, African, and Nordic peoples, myths, and legends.  Of particular interest are his poems about the paleolithic European caves of Niaux<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and Pech-Merle.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.csulb.edu/%7Ecsnider/Cave.of.Pech_Merle.html|title = Prehistoric Cave Art II|first = Clifton|last = Snider}}</ref> [[Robert Peters (playwright)|Robert Peters]] examines Snider's work in a chapter titled \"Poems for an Autobiography\" in ''The Great American Poetry Bake-off'' (1987).\n\nIn 1986 at The Works Gallery, Long Beach, California, Out Theater produced as its premier production ''Edwin: A Performance Art Event'', based on Snider's book, ''Edwin: A Character in Poems'' (1984), and his one-act play, ''A Little Get-Together''.\n\nAlthough, with the exception of ''Bad Smoke  Good Body'', Snider's early books focused on characters he invented, fellow Long Beach poet and critic Gerald Locklin maintains in ''Western American Literature''<ref>[http://www.usu.edu/westlit/ Western Literature Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330044658/http://www.usu.edu/westlit/ |date=March 30, 2008 }}</ref> that Snider's fifth book of poems, ''Blood & Bones'' (1988), \"completes, with the dropping of the 'Jesse' and 'Edwin' personae, [Snider's] transition from modern to postmodern artist. The confidence he now exhibits renders accessible to artistic use a rich though often painful personal history.\"  Of the same book, Richard Labonte writes in the national gay and lesbian magazine, [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]: \"Southern California poet Clifton Snider explores the unexpected, the near tragic, and the adventurous.  In three sections, he writes of a trip through Europe in the '70s, of his sudden hospitalization with a bleeding ulcer, and of his return to travel in Europe in the mid '80s.  Poems of the first trip are soaked with the blood oozing into his guts; poems of the second trip reflect good health, a good eye, and maturity.  The contrast is appealing; the poems, beguiling.\"\n\n''Impervious to Piranhas'' (1989), the chapbook that followed ''Blood & Bones'', collects poems, early and late, which Snider had not found places for in his earlier collections.  ''The Age of the Mother'' (1992), the full-length book that Snider published next, was praised by Glenn Bach (\"In these beautifully spare words, Snider weaves personal mantras of birth, death, and transcendence.

Eva von Kesselhausen, for example, writes in the ''Small Press Review'': \"Clifton Snider has been writing and publishing for over 25 years to establish himself as one of American's best . . . contemporary poets.  ''The Alchemy of Opposites'' . . . stands as his most outstanding book to date . . .

''The Alchemy of Opposites'' indeed contains outcroppings of pure gold.\"  Two poems from this collection, \"Le Mont Saint- Michel\" and \"Honey from Heaven,\" won \"In the Spotlight\" awards from the online magazine, The Poetry Page, in 1999.\n\nSnider published his collection of poems, ''Aspens in the Wind,'' in 2009.  His much-anticipated career retrospective, covering his 40 years of publishing history, ''Moonman: New and Selected Poems'', came out from World Parade Books in the spring of 2012.  In the national online journal, ''Lambda Literary'', Tony Leuzzi writes, \"''Moonman ''traces Snider's fluid movement from one idiom to another: restrained poems in traditional forms; intellectual utterances that demonstrate his awareness of Western and Eastern philosophical systems; chatty, casual poems that respond to aspects of popular culture; and, most impressively, concise and memorable imagist verse. . . .

There are song lyrics, a sonnet, and nonsense verse inspired by Lennon's own books.  Snider draws on his background in Jungian and Queer criticism to create a unique and refreshing book of poetry and prose (there are two fan letters) about the Beatles.\n\nOn July 7, 2018, Snider was awarded the inaugural Lorde-Whitman Award for \"outstanding achievement in the arts and service to the LGBTQ community\" from OUT LOUD: A Cultural Evolution, Long Beach, California.\n\n==Novels==\nIn 2000-2001 Snider published in rapid succession three novels he had written in the 1980s: ''Loud Whisper'', ''Bare Roots'', and ''Wrestling with Angels: A Tale of Two Brothers''.

''Loud Whisper'' chronicles the frontman for an 80's rock band who, drunk and drugged out, falls from stage during a concert and becomes paralyzed.  As always, Snider is concerned with spiritual decline and revitalization.  Through the eyes of the frontman, Adam, his band members, his male and female lovers, and a journalist doing a story on him, Adam's spiritual and physical struggles unfold.\n\nA long-time lecturer at Cal State Long Beach, Snider retired in 2009.

The short novel examines the relationships between the 17th-century English settlers of Plymouth Colony and the native peoples they encountered, with a frame character from the 19th century who discovers the papers.\n\nSnider continues to write poetry, fiction, and criticism.

He has a B.A. and an M.A. from California State University, Long Beach, and a Ph.D. from the University of New Mexico.  He has taught at various institutions of higher education in southern California, primarily at Long Beach City College and at California State University, Long Beach.\n\n==Early life==\nClifton Snider was born in [[Duluth, Minnesota]], the second of five sons.  His father, Allan G. Snider, was a minister with the [[Assemblies of God]] denomination.  His mother, Rhoda M. Tout, had traveled as an evangelist with Olga Olsson before her marriage to Allan Snider.  Because the father was a minister, the family moved frequently.  By the age of twelve, Snider had lived in Minnesota; Joliet, Illinois; Terre Haute, Indiana; and several cities in southern California.\n\n==Critic and scholar==\nHe went to Southern California College (an Assemblies of God institution now called [[Vanguard University]]) on music and academic scholarships.  After two years, he transferred to [[California State University, Long Beach]], where he finished his B.A., graduating with honors in 1969, and his M.A. (1971).  He received his Ph.D. in English Literature in 1974 from the [[University of New Mexico]].  Snider's doctoral dissertation is a Jungian analysis of [[Swinburne]]'s ''Tristram of Lyonesse'', and he has published numerous articles on Victorian literature, as well as twentieth century English and American literatures.  These include introductions to Jungian psychology (or [[Analytical Psychology]]) and criticism, histories of [[Merlin]] in 19th-century British literature, as well as such authors as [[W. H. Auden]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Edward Lear]], [[Carson McCullers]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[Oscar Wilde]], and [[Virginia Woolf]]. A specialist in Wilde, he has taught his own seminars on him at California State University, Long Beach, and published several articles on Wilde using his primary critical approaches of Jungian and Queer Criticism.  He also taught the first course ever on Gays and Lesbians in Literature at Cal State Long Beach.  His book, ''The Stuff That Dreams Are Made On: A Jungian Interpretation of Literature'', contains a chapter on Wilde.  His latest article uses Jungian and Queer Criticism to examine ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'', story and film, and appears in the Jungian journal, ''Psychological Perspectives'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.junginla.org/psychological_perspectives.htm |title=C.G.

In the early 1980s he was a contributing editor for the ''Maelstrom Review''.\n\n==Activism==\nA political/peace activist, Snider has posted poems on the national web site, Poets Against the War,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://poetsagainstthewar.org/displaypoem.asp?AuthorID=314#453073947 |title=Poets Against War |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310034655/http://poetsagainstthewar.org/displaypoem.asp?AuthorID=314#453073947 |archivedate=March 10, 2005 }}</ref> and maintains his own web page, A Poet Against the War,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.csulb.edu/~csnider/Poets_Against_the_War.html|title = A Poet Against the War|first = Clifton|last = Snider}}</ref> on which he has posted some of his own poetry.  The page includes many news items, photos, and links regarding the war in Iraq, not the least of which are statistics of the dead and wounded and information about the slaughter in Iraq of academics and gay people.  He has served as an officer in the Long Beach Lambda Democratic Club.\n\nIn the midst of the presidential election during the fall semester of 2004 at Cal State Long Beach, Snider became involved in a national controversy over [[academic freedom]] when two of his students, a young woman and a young man, went on [[Fox News]] to complain about Snider's comments the first night of a freshman composition class.  Because his emphasis in a class that is supposed to promote critical thinking about controversial issues was on morality and spirituality, Snider used the war in Iraq as an example of immorality.  He invited any student who disagreed to say so, and these two did.  A number of others in the class agreed with Snider.

In New Mexico he has held a number of residence grants at the Helene Wurlitzer Foundation, Taos.  (Other residence grants he has held have been at Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, and the Karolyi Foundation, Vence, France.)

The confidence he now exhibits renders accessible to artistic use a rich though often painful personal history.\"  Of the same book, Richard Labonte writes in the national gay and lesbian magazine, [[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]: \"Southern California poet Clifton Snider explores the unexpected, the near tragic, and the adventurous.  In three sections, he writes of a trip through Europe in the '70s, of his sudden hospitalization with a bleeding ulcer, and of his return to travel in Europe in the mid '80s.

The contrast is appealing; the poems, beguiling.\"\n\n''Impervious to Piranhas'' (1989), the chapbook that followed ''Blood & Bones'', collects poems, early and late, which Snider had not found places for in his earlier collections.  ''The Age of the Mother'' (1992), the full-length book that Snider published next, was praised by Glenn Bach (\"In these beautifully spare words, Snider weaves personal mantras of birth, death, and transcendence.

His much-anticipated career retrospective, covering his 40 years of publishing history, ''Moonman: New and Selected Poems'', came out from World Parade Books in the spring of 2012.  In the national online journal, ''Lambda Literary'', Tony Leuzzi writes, \"''Moonman ''traces Snider's fluid movement from one idiom to another: restrained poems in traditional forms; intellectual utterances that demonstrate his awareness of Western and Eastern philosophical systems; chatty, casual poems that respond to aspects of popular culture; and, most impressively, concise and memorable imagist verse. . . .

There are song lyrics, a sonnet, and nonsense verse inspired by Lennon's own books.

''Loud Whisper'' chronicles the frontman for an 80's rock band who, drunk and drugged out, falls from stage during a concert and becomes paralyzed.  As always, Snider is concerned with spiritual decline and revitalization.  Through the eyes of the frontman, Adam, his band members, his male and female lovers, and a journalist doing a story on him, Adam's spiritual and physical struggles unfold.\n\nA long-time lecturer at Cal State Long Beach, Snider retired in 2009.

They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination and/or emotions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The characters are typically depicted as members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], an interstellar law enforcement agency.\n\nThe first Green Lantern character, [[Alan Scott]], was created in 1940 by [[Martin Nodell]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, [[Gotham City]]) with the aid of his magic ring. For the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]] reinvented the character as [[Hal Jordan]] in 1959 and shifted the focus of Green Lantern stories from fantasy to science fiction. Other notable Green Lanterns include [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], and [[Kyle Rayner]].\n\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{see also|Green Lantern (comic book)}}\n\n=== Golden Age ===\n{{main|Alan Scott}}\n[[File:All-American Comics 16.jpg|right|thumb|600px|Green Lantern's debut in ''All-American Comics#16'' (July 1940).<br/>Art by [[Sheldon Moldoff]].]]\n\n[[Martin Nodell]] (initially using the name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern. He first appeared in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940), published by [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would eventually merge to form [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/104 104]-105 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |url-access=registration |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis Green Lantern's real name was [[Alan Scott]], a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a [[magic ring]] which gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \"charged\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time, and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal [[Vandal Savage]] and the zombie [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Most stories took place in New York.\n\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as ''All-American Comics'' and ''[[Comic Cavalcade]]'', as well as his own book, ''Green Lantern''. He also appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' as a member of the superhero team known as the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the popularity of [[superhero]]es in general declined. The ''Green Lantern'' [[comic book]] was cancelled with issue #38 (May\u2013June 1949), and ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new [[Hal Jordan]] character who had been created to supplant him (see below).  Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series. Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \"Sentinel\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fiction Green Lanterns.\n\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \"the Green\").\n\n===Silver Age===\nIn 1959, [[Julius Schwartz]] reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named [[Hal Jordan]]. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different than the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the [[Guardians of the Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Albert|first=Aaron|url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/greenlantern/p/glhaljordan.htm|title=Green Lantern - Hal Jordan Profile|accessdate=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117112607/http://comicbooks.about.com/od/greenlantern/p/glhaljordan.htm|archivedate=17 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Showcase 22.png|200px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Showcase'' #22 (October 1959), the first appearance of [[Hal Jordan]].]]\n\nHal Jordan was introduced in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #22 (September\u2013October 1959). [[Gil Kane]] and [[Sid Greene]] were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]].

Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]] to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character [[Green Arrow]] (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled ''Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow'') and had the pair travel through America encountering \"real world\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways \u2014 Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]]. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" story was published (issues #85 and #86) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] (the later grown-up hero [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]) developed a [[heroin]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]'' citing it as an example of how comic books were \"growing up\".<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Johns Hopkins, 2001. p. 227</ref> However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as backups in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #217-219.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|date= December 2010|title= Green Lantern/Green Arrow: And Through Them Change an Industry|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 39\u201354|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe title saw a number of revivals and cancellations. It changed to ''Green Lantern Corps'' at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, [[Kyle Rayner]], was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], then died and came back as the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].\n\nIn the wake of ''[[DC: The New Frontier|The New Frontier]]'', writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' (2004\u201305). Johns began to lay groundwork for \"[[Blackest Night]]\" (released July 13, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401227864 |title=Green Lantern: Blackest Night (9781401227869): Geoff Johns, Doug Mahnke: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by ''Rebirth''. Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \"[[Sinestro Corps War]]\" (2007), Johns, with artist [[Ethan van Sciver]], found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \"lanterns\".\n\n===Awards===\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 [[Alley Award]] for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/alley61.php|title=1961 Alley Awards|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2006|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac}}</ref> and the [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] [[Shazam Award]] for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\", ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2, #76, by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]]),<ref name=\"Shazam1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/shazam70.php|title=1970 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards\n|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac|year=2006|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\", ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2, #85 by O'Neil and Adams).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/shazam71.php|title=1971 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards\n|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac|year=2006|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on ''Green Lantern'', ''[[Batman]]'', ''[[Superman]]'', and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on ''Green Lantern'' and ''Batman''.<ref name=\"Shazam1970\"/> Inker [[Dick Giordano]] received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on ''Green Lantern'' and other titles.<ref name=\"Shazam1970\"/>\n\nIn [[Judd Winick]]'s first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in Green Lantern #137 (June 2001).

The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death (a lamp-maker named Luke Fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp; in fear and as punishment for what they thought [[sacrilege]], the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame), once to bring life (in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern; the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life), and once to bring power. By 1940, the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott, a young engineer. Following a railroad-bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime-fighter. Alan was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] (although the original origin story was still in continuity), a later ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps' ranks, when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth's Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, a resident of China. Not only had the Corps' now-familiar green, black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted, but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen. Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern, as he attempted to rule over mankind, which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood, the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned. This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted \"champion\". His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the \"intelligence\" inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the Guardians was damaged. Over time, when it had occasion to manifest itself, this \"intelligence\" became known as the mystical 'Starheart' of fable.\n\nCenturies later, it was explained, when Scott found the mystical lantern, it had no memory of its true origins, save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master. This was the origin of Scott's distinctive costume. Due to its damaged link to them, the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record, thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps, sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood. Honoring this separate history, the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring, formally join the Corps, or adopt its colors. Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps, however, was hinted at in a Silver Age crossover story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the \"Brightest Day\" oath.  During the [[Rann-Thanagar War]], it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, DC Comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of Alan Scott as a gay man in the title \"Earth 2.\" The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012.<ref name=\"Reuters.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/01/us-gay-greenlatern-idUSBRE85017H20120601|title=Gay Green Lantern appears in alternate universe|author=Daniel Trotta|date=June 1, 2012|work=Reuters.com}}</ref> In its story, Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived; a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming Green Lantern. This alternate version is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his mystical powers derive  from the [[Parliament of Trees|Green]] (the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth).\n\n===Silver Age Green Lantern===\n\n==== Hal Jordan ====\n{{Main|Hal Jordan}}\n\nThe character of Harold \"Hal\" Jordan was a second-generation [[test pilot]], having followed in the footsteps of his father. He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] named [[Abin Sur]], whose [[Starship|spaceship]] crashed on [[Earth]]. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was \"utterly honest and born without fear\" to take his place as a member of the corps. At one point, when Hal Jordan was incapacitated, it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth, the other being [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur. Gardner then became listed as Hal's \"backup\", even though he had a strong friendship with Barry Allen (The Flash). Gardner would fill in if Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated. Later, when Gardner was put into a coma, it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], who was designated as the Earth Sector's \"backup\" Lantern. Jordan, as Green Lantern, became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid-2000s is, along with John Stewart, one of the two active-duty Lanterns in Earth's sector of space.\n\nJordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic \"police\" force which bears some similarities to the \"[[Lensman series|Lensmen]]\" from the science fiction series written by [[E. E. Smith|E.E. Smith]], although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith's stories.<ref name=\"Lensmen\">{{Cite news | last=Thomas | first=Roy | title=The Lensman Connection | periodical=Alter Ego | volume=3 | issue=10 | year=2001 | page=24 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->}}</ref> Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries \"Green Lantern Corps\" honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: [[List of Green Lanterns#Eddore|Eddore of Tront]] and [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]].\n\nFollowing the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern's hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s, Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery. Now calling himself [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe on and off for the next several years.  However, after Earth's sun was threatened by a Sun-Eater, Jordan sacrificed his life, expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star.  Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance, whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption, which ended in failure.\n\nIn ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] when he turned renegade.  Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past.  Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten, becoming known merely as the \"yellow impurity\" in the power rings. [[Sinestro]] was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host. Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan (via his ring) for some time, it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed. It took advantage of Jordan's weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way. After killing several Green Lanterns, Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power, unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul.\n\nThe Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern's soul from Parallax's taint, but was not strong enough to do so. In ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'', Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax-Spectre-Jordan composite. Thanks to a supreme effort of will, Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax, rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring. The newly revived (and rejuvenated) Jordan awoke just in time to save [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Green Arrow]] from Sinestro. After the Korugarian's defeat, Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet, imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth's Lanterns, rendering the Green Lantern's rings free of the yellow impurity, provided they had the power of will to do so.\nHal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps, and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814, personally defeating Sinestro in the [[Sinestro Corps War]]. Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814.1.\n\nPost-''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'', [[DC Comics]] revisited the origin of [[Hal Jordan]] as a precursor to ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, the next chapter in the [[Geoff Johns]] era on ''Green Lantern''.\nHal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]] in the 2011 ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' film.\n\n===Bronze Age Green Lanterns===\n<!-- Should this pair be listed in perceived importance or in publication order? -->\n\n====Guy Gardner====\n{{Main|Guy Gardner (comics)}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814. Gardner was a candidate to receive Abin Sur's ring, but Jordan was closer. This placed him as the \"backup\" Green Lantern for Jordan.  But early in his career as a Green Lantern, tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face, putting him in a coma for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Guardians split into factions, one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion. As a result of his years in a coma, Guy was emotionally unstable, although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly. He has gone through many changes, including wielding [[Sinestro]]'s yellow Guardian power ring, then gaining and losing [[Vuldarian]] powers, and readmission to the Corps during ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''. He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns. Gardner is designated as Green Lantern 2814.2 within the Corps.\n\nGuy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.\n\nFollowing his outstanding acts of valour, the Guardians appoint Guy to a unique role and highest rank in the Green Lantern Corps-Sentinel, answering directly to the Guardians themselves.\n\n====John Stewart====\n{{Main|John Stewart (comics)}}\n\n<!-- \"Bronze Age\" notation -->\nIn the early 1970s, John Stewart, an architect from [[Detroit]], was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan. When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time, Stewart served as the regular Lantern, coming into his own as he battled numerous Green Lantern villains and played a key role during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. During that time the Guardians of the Universe assigned [[Katma Tui]] to train Stewart, and the two developed romantic feelings for each other. They married, but Katma was soon murdered by longtime Green Lantern villain Star Sapphire. Stewart was crushed by this, and his life began to unravel. He reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet Xanshi from destruction during the [[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]].\n\nJohn Stewart redeemed himself during the [[Green Lantern: Mosaic|Mosaic]] crisis, when an insane Guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on Oa. When the Guardian was defeated, the cities remained, as the other Guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the Central Power Battery to send them home. While they gathered the resources, John Stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities. Using his intellect and unconventional thinking, he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society. He was aided by Rose Hardin, a farmer from West Virginia who was trapped on Oa, due to her town being abducted. Stewart once again found love with Rose, and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on Earth.\n\nStewart eventually deduced that the Guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted, and that they let them remain on Oa as an experiment in cosmic integration, and also as a test for John Stewart. Stewart passed the test, and discovered that he was a figure in Oan prophecy. That was why the Guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a Power Ring to do it, as is standard procedure. John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe. He was also rewarded with the resurrection of Katma Tui, which caused him to break up with Rose.\n\nStewart's new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when Hal Jordan went mad and became Parallax, absorbing the power from the Central Power Battery. During this time, the Green Lantern Corps was disbanded, and Stewart went on to lead the [[Darkstars]], a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the Controllers, offshoots of the Guardians of the Universe. During a battle, Stewart was badly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. Hal Jordan eventually restored his ability to walk before sacrificing himself to save Earth's sun. Soon after, John Stewart found himself hunted by a serial killer from Xanshi called [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]. She sought out any remnants of the Green Lantern Corps so that she might kill them in the name of avenging her doomed planet. Stewart fended off Fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body, which was in him due to Hal Jordan healing his crippling condition; however, this left him unable to walk again.\n\nStewart later visited Fatality while she was in custody, and she revealed to him that his back was fine, and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to. Stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to feeling guilty over his sister's death. Stewart overcame this condition and was given a power ring by Kyle Rayner. Rayner departed Earth and Stewart became the Green Lantern of Earth once again, and also a member of the Justice League of America.\n\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps reformed, Stewart began serving with Jordan as one of his sector's two designated regular-duty Lanterns, designated as Green Lantern 2814.3. Since then, he has played key roles in all big Green Lantern events, such as ''The Sinestro Corps War'' and ''Blackest Night''.\n\nIn the New 52 continuity, John Stewart was a U.S. Marine along with being an architect and the son of a social activist. He started a romantic relationship with his longtime enemy Fatality, who by that point had become a Star Sapphire and apparently forgave him for failing to save her world. In the events leading up to the \"Uprising\", Fatality was captured by shape-shifting Durlans, and a Durlan operative replicated her and took her place. John Stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship, but he eventually came to love Fatality, but it turns out that it had been the impostor by that point. In the final battle of the \"Uprising\", the impostor revealed itself as Verrat Din, an eons old Durlan, and destroyed Fatality's Star Sapphire ring, having no use for it after gaining the power of a Daxamite. Though Stewart defeated the powerful threat, he was shaken by having been misled so long, and having been intimate with a Durlan shape-shifter.\n\nStewart immediately set out to find the real Fatality, and when he did, he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him. Fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the Star Sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them. When her ring was destroyed, the spell was broken. Every moment she was with Stewart, she was trapped within herself. She revealed that she never loved John Stewart and departed, leaving Stewart emotionally crushed.\n\nJohn Stewart is notable for being the Green Lantern showcased on the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' cartoon shows, as well as being the primary Green Lantern of the [[DC Animated Universe]].\n\n===Modern Age Green Lanterns===\n\n==== Kyle Rayner ====\n{{Main|Kyle Rayner}}\n\nKyle Rayner was a struggling freelance artist when he was approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, [[Ganthet]], to become a new Green Lantern with the very last power ring. Ganthet's reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time. Despite not being from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordan\u2014or perhaps because of that\u2014Rayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters. Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA, he became known amongst the Oans as ''The Torch Bearer''. He briefly operated as [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]] after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps. He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re-ignition of the Central Power Battery, essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax.\n\nKyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear, and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery. Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax. Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear, and yellow, none of the other Green Lanterns, including Hal, could harm Parallax and, therefore, came under his control. Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again.\n\nKyle became Ion, who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear. During the [[Sinestro Corps War]] between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps, Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle. In ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #24, Parallax consumes Hal Jordan.  Hal Jordan enters into Kyle's prison, and with his help, Kyle finally escapes Parallax.\n\nAfterward, [[Ganthet]] and [[Sayd]] trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth. Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again.  Kyle accepts, and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring. Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform.  Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard, and has been partnered with Guy Gardner.\n\nKyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''.  Corps rookie [[Sodam Yat]] took over the mantle of Ion. Sodam has made an appearance in the [[Legion of Super Heroes]] ''[[Final Crisis]]'' tie-in ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' as the last surviving Green Lantern/Guardian of the Universe.\n\nKyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814.4 within the Corps.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nKyle Rayner died in ''Green Lantern Corps'' #42 (Jan. 2010) after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps. The following issue, Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu's heart to his heart.\n[[File:Simon Baz with gun.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Baz]] as seen on the cover of Green Lantern #0 (November 2012).]]\n\n====Simon Baz====\n{{Main|Simon Baz}}\nSimon Baz is a [[Lebanese American]] [[Muslim]] from the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

He was caught by the police street racing in a stolen car with an armed bomb in the back of the van. While being questioned by authorities, Sinestro's Green Lantern ring chose Simon as its next ring bearer, recruiting him into the Green Lantern Corps. The squirrel-like Lantern B'dg follows, becoming Baz's mentor and friend. The [[Justice League]] eventually tracks Baz down and questions him as to how he came into the possession of a Green Lantern ring.

Jessica Cruz is a young Latin American woman who was forced to become the unwilling host to the evil Ring of Volthoom after \"[[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]]\" dies in his alternate Earth universe. Though she is not technically \"Power Ring\", as she is not a member of the [[Crime Syndicate]] and has no association with the organization, for namesake purposes she is dubbed \"Power Ring\" while the ring uses her as a host. She is helped by the Justice League and Simon Baz, who help her understand her cursed powers. In the Darkseid War, she becomes trapped inside the Ring of Volthoom, as Volthoom himself takes over Jessica's body. She then battles the previous wearers of the ring with the help of Cyborg, and forces her body in front of the Black Racer (who at the time was controlling the Flash) and kills Volthoom. After the battle, whilst the League mourns her motionless body, a Green Lantern ring appears and Jessica is made the 6th Green Lantern of Earth, to everyone's surprise.\n\nIn ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'' #1, she meets up with Simon Baz to battle a Manhunter. This turns out to be an exercise controlled by [[Hal Jordan]], as he needs them to protect Earth whilst he goes on a mission to find the rest of the Corps. He then fuses both their Lanterns into one, which can only be used when they are together. Hal also gives them membership into the Justice League to help with their training.\n\n===Others who have headlined as Green Lantern in a Green Lantern Comic or related title===\n\n==== Jade ====\n{{Main|Jade (comics)}}\nThe daughter of Alan Scott, '''Jennifer-Lynn Hayden''' would discover she shared her father's mystical connection to the [[Alan Scott#Post Crisis and Ragnarok|Starheart]], which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern. Choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, she became the superheroine Jade. She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities. When Jade was fighting an Okaaran monster, she was saved by an orange lantern named Cade and fell in love with him.\n\nAfter Jade was stripped of her powers, Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan's power ring. When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps, Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet's Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]. Later, when the ring was returned to her, she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner's. Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner, as Ion, used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart. During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', she died while trying to stop [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse. Upon her death, Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner. In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, her remains have been reanimated as one of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] after receiving a black power ring. She was resurrected by the [[Life Entity]] along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members.\n\nFollowing the New 52 and DC Rebirth, she has been removed from continuity. This creates a major hole in Kyle Raynor's backstory as well, given how long they were together. She was later returned to continuity along with her father Alan Scott and the rest of the JSA during [[Doomsday Clock]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Thaal Sinestro====\n{{Main|Sinestro}}\nSinestro was born on the planet Korugar and became Green Lantern of space sector 1417. He was a friend of [[Abin Sur]] and mentor to Hal Jordan. His desire for order was an asset in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter what the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator. Exposed by Hal Jordan and punished, he later wielded a yellow ring of fear from [[Qward]]. Later in league with Parallax, he would establish the [[Sinestro Corps]], which began the [[War of Light]]. Following ''[[Blackest Night]]'' and ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]'' Sinestro would once again receive a Green Lantern ring and temporarily headline the monthly ''Green Lantern'' following [[The New 52]]. In Scott Snyders Justice League it was revealed that Sinestro was searching for the entity, Umbrax, which is one of the seven hidden forces of the universe. Umbrax represents the unseen emotions of the Ultraviolet Lantern Corps. Sinestro finally discovers this force and creates and army of Ultraviolet lanterns including John Stewart (whom later gets freed.) \n \n{{Clear}}\n\n====Jediah Caul====\nPremiering in ''Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual'' #1, Caul is a deep undercover Green Lantern operative that works in the Tenebrian Dominion. He unwillingly helps Carol Ferris and the New Guardians attempt to petition [[Lady Styx]] to send aid against the Third Army. For betraying them, the New Guardians leave Caul behind and he is forced to become part of a reality program called \"The Hunted\", stripped of his powers and with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. Caul stars as part of an ensemble cast of spacebound DC characters including the [[Blue Beetle]] and a new [[Captain Carrot|Captain K'rot]] in the \"Hunted\" main feature of ''[[Threshold (DC Comics)|Threshold]]''. Caul received his Green Lantern Ring after he shot and killed its previous bearer, unsure himself why he was then chosen. Caul is able to save Sh'diki Borough on the planet Tolerance after it had been bottled by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. Caul is later informed that The Hunted has been canceled and offered the lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron, with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Lady Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by Colonel [[Tommy Tomorrow|T'omas T'morra]]. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show. However Caul is shown alive later along with Captain K'rot in tow when the planet Telos manifests during the 2015 \"[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]\" storyline, investigating it alongside Superman, Supergirl, Guy Gardner, and the Red Lanterns.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Sojourner \"Jo\" Mullein====\nIs a rookie Green Lantern who must investigate the first murder committed in City Enduring for the last 500 years. She headlines as Green Lantern in [[Far Sector]] published by DC Young Animal.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Others who have a supporting role as a Green Lantern===\n\n====Charles Vicker====\nCharlie Vicker was an actor who portrayed Green Lantern in a TV show on Earth. Charlie enjoyed his fame and happily threw himself into the life of a playboy television star. After one particularly grueling night of partying, Charlie was too hung over to show up on set so his brother Rodger had to go on as his stand in. Unfortunately for Roger, a group of various space criminals, led by former Earth criminal Al Magone, mistook the television Green Lantern for the real thing and attacked during a live broadcast. The criminals were ones previous imprisoned by the Green Lanterns on a special timeless criminal planet who had banded together and launched simultaneous attacks on Green Lanterns across the galaxy. By the time the real Green Lantern Hal Jordan arrived on the scene, the defenseless stand-in was dead and the criminal responsible was gone. Charlie was overcome with grief and blamed himself for his brother's death. He demanded that Hal Jordan bring him along in his hunt for the murderer responsible, so that Charlie could avenge his brother.\n\nEventually the two, along with the rest of the Green Lantern Corp tracked the criminals down and brought their terror to an end. During the battle, Green Lantern gave Vicker a power ring from one of the fallen Green Lanterns and appointed him a temporary Green Lantern. Vicker proved himself well enough that the Guardians of the Universe granted him his own Power Ring. He was assigned to Sector 3319 where the strange alien inhabitants made Vicker uncomfortable and alone. Just when he considered resigning from the Green Lantern Corps, Vicker saved an alien child from death. The child's mother was extremely grateful to Vicker making him realize that their physical differences hid how similar the aliens were to mankind.\n\nVicker would later use his skills as an actor to teach the natives of his sector the great plays of Earth. When an invasion force threatened his sector following the first destruction of the Central Power Battery, the now depowered Vicker raised and trained a resistance group that eventually repelled the invaders and ensured his adopted people's freedom. Vicker later joined John Stewart's Darkstars. He was killed during the battle with [[Grayven]], third son of Darkseid.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Keli Quintela====\n[[Young Justice]] (vol. 3) #1 (March 2019) introduced Keli Quintela as Teen Lantern. An unofficial Green Lantern, Quintela is an eleven-year old from La Paz, Bolivia that received a Green Lantern power gauntlet similar to Krona's from a dying green lantern that she then modified and hacked to act like a Green Lantern power ring.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics)}}\nThe ring is powered by willpower. \nEach Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.\n\nEarly Green Lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring, from shrinking objects to turning people invisible. Later stories de-emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs.\n\nThe signature power of all Green Lanterns is the ability to conjure \"constructs:\" solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically.  These can be anything, such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, or chains to bind a prisoner. Whatever their shape or size, these constructs are always pure green in color, unless a Lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the EM spectrum the construct emits. Hal Jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under Batman's guidance.\n\nThe rings of the Green Lantern Corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances, fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe. They allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment, and also remove the need to eat, sleep and pass waste. The rings can translate practically any language in the universe.  They possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects. Lanterns are granted full access to all Guardian knowledge by their rings through the Book of Oa.\n\nA noteworthy power the rings '''do not''' have is the ability to automatically heal injuries, though they can provide shielding. In Hal Jordan's origin story, Abin Sur passed on his ring to Hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries. If the Green Lantern happens to be a skilled physician, then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool, but it cannot do much for a Lantern who lacks medical expertise. When Hal Jordan breaks his arm, the best he can do is conjure up a cast. This is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one's injured body with constructs, but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one's body and concentration enough to prolong the construct.\n\nAlan Scott's ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood. Alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly.  The rings of Hal Jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow, though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the Central Battery on Oa, more recent stories have removed this weakness.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will beat a weaker-willed Lantern in a duel.  Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, may render his ring useless.\n\n==Green Lantern Oath==\nGreen Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring. Originally, the oath was:\n\n{{poemquote|\n... and I shall shed my light over dark evil.\nFor the dark things cannot stand the light,\nThe light of the Green Lantern!|Alan Scott}}\n\nThis oath is also used by Lanterns [[Tomar-Re]] of sector 2813 and Chief Administrator [[Salaak]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' #206</ref>\nIn the mid-1940s, this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nNo evil shall escape my sight!\nLet those who worship evil's might\nBeware my power, Green Lantern's light!|Hal Jordan/many current Lanterns}}\n\nThe oath in this form is credited to [[Alfred Bester]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Julius |authorlink= Julius Schwartz |title= Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics |url= https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |year= 2000 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw/page/67 67\u201368] |ISBN= 0-380-810514}}</ref> who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s. This version of the oath was first spoken by Alan Scott in ''Green Lantern'' #9 from the fall of 1943. Scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the Silver Age.\n\nMany Green Lanterns have a unique personal oath, but some oaths are shared by several Lanterns. They are usually four lines long with a [[rhyme scheme]] of \"AAAA\" or \"AABB\".\n\nThe [[Pre-Crisis]] version of Hal Jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals: in the first adventure, he used his ring as [[radar]] to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash; in the second, he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with [[phosphorescence]]; finally, Jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used.\n\n[[Medphyll]], the Green Lantern of the planet J586 (seen in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #61, \"All Flesh is Grass\"), a planet where a sentient plant species lives, has the following oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn forest dark or glade beferned,\nNo blade of grass shall go unturned!\nLet those who have the daylight spurned\nTread not where this green lamp has burned!}}\n\nOther notable oaths include that of [[Jack T. Chance]],\n\n{{poemquote|\nYou who are wicked, evil and mean,\nI'm the nastiest creep you've ever seen!\nCome one, come all, put up a fight,\nI'll pound your butts with Green Lantern's light!\nYowza!}}\n\nand that of [[Rot Lop Fan]], a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight, and thus has no concepts of brightness, darkness, day, night, color, or lanterns.\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn loudest din or hush profound,\nMy ears catch evil's slightest sound!\nLet those who toll out [[evil]]'s knell\nBeware my power, the [[Musical scale|F-Sharp]] [[Bell (instrument)|Bell]]!}}\n\nIn ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #27, the [[Alpha Lanterns]] use the oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn days of peace, in nights of war,\nObey the Laws forever more!\nMisconduct must be answered for,\nSwear us the chosen: The Alpha Corps!}}\n\nIn ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of 3 Worlds]]'', [[Sodam Yat]] in the 31st century \u2013 the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians \u2013 recited a new oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, through [[The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]],\nNo other Corps shall spread its light!\nLet those who try to stop what's right\nBurn like my power, Green Lantern's light!}}\n\nIn ''Batman: The Dawnbreaker'' #1, the Dawnbreaker (an amalgamation of Batman and Green Lantern from the Dark Multiverse's Earth-32) creates and recites his own oath after the death of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps by his own hands:\n\n{{poemquote|\nWith darkness black, I choke the light!\nNo brightest day escapes my sight!\nI turn the dawn to midnight!\nBeware my power--Dawnbreaker's might!}}\n\nIn ''The Green Lantern'' #11, written by [[Grant Morrison]], several distinct oaths were used by the Green Lanterns of the Multiverse. Morrison's creation 'Magic Lantern' <ref>https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Lantern_(Earth_47)</ref>, first seen in his run on [[Animal Man]], used this oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nWhen it's groovy, when it's grim,\nWe hum the Living Guru's hymn.\nWhen other Lanterns lose their sh...,\nWe keep the Magic Lantern lit!}} <ref>''The Green Lantern'' #11 (October 2019)</ref>\n(since it was an all-ages book, the last word in the third line was obscured by another oath balloon from another Lantern.)\n\n\nIn the video game, ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]'', Hal Jordan of Earth-13 (the Arcane universe) has his own variation:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn forests deep where darkness dwells,\nIn dungeons dank beneath ancient fells,\nLet those who seek to rule the night\nBeware my power, the Emerald Light!}}\n\nIn the animated TV series ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'', Duck Dodgers temporarily becomes a Green Lantern after accidentally picking up Hal Jordan's laundry. In the first part of the episode, he forgets the real quote and makes up his own version:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn blackest day or brightest night\n[[Walla|Watermelon, cantaloupe]], yadda yadda,\nErm ... [[Batman#Golden Age|superstitious and cowardly lot]],\n[[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|With liberty and justice for all!]]}}\n\nIn 2011, soon after the release of the ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' movie, a trailer for ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]'' featured [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] reciting a parody of the oath:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Muppets - Being Green Teaser Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUUcOmgYEhY/|publisher=MuppetsStudio|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, in darkest night,\nNo evil shall escape my sight!\nLet those who laugh at my lack of height\nBeware my [[banjo]] ...

Blu from ''Rio'' is turned into a Green Lantern, and recruits [[Big Bird]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], Mordecai from ''[[Regular Show]]'', Mumble from ''[[Happy Feet]]'', and one of the [[Angry Birds]] and turns them into Green Lanterns.\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nDespite our shape, our size, our height,\nWe're birds who walk, which isn't right,\nBut starting now, we will take flight!}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Green Lantern in other media}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Green Lantern: The Animated Series]]''\n* [[Doctor Spectrum]], a [[Marvel Comics]] homage to Green Lantern.\n* The [[Green Lantern Corps]].\n\n==References==\n{{Portal bar|United States|Television|Film|Cartoon|Animation|Comics|Video games|Speculative fiction|1950s|1960s|1980s|1990s}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Uncle Sam was debuted by Will Eisner.

They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers, all of which come from imagination and/or emotions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The characters are typically depicted as members of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], an interstellar law enforcement agency.\n\nThe first Green Lantern character, [[Alan Scott]], was created in 1940 by [[Martin Nodell]] during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] and usually fought common criminals in Capitol City (and later, [[Gotham City]]) with the aid of his magic ring. For the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Gil Kane]] reinvented the character as [[Hal Jordan]] in 1959 and shifted the focus of Green Lantern stories from fantasy to science fiction. Other notable Green Lanterns include [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], and [[Kyle Rayner]].\n\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{see also|Green Lantern (comic book)}}\n\n=== Golden Age ===\n{{main|Alan Scott}}\n[[File:All-American Comics 16.jpg|right|thumb|600px|Green Lantern's debut in ''All-American Comics#16'' (July 1940).<br/>Art by [[Sheldon Moldoff]].]]\n\n[[Martin Nodell]] (initially using the name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern. He first appeared in the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940), published by [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that would eventually merge to form [[DC Comics]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/104 104]-105 |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent |url-access=registration |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis Green Lantern's real name was [[Alan Scott]], a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a [[magic ring]] which gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \"charged\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time, and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal [[Vandal Savage]] and the zombie [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]]. Most stories took place in New York.\n\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as ''All-American Comics'' and ''[[Comic Cavalcade]]'', as well as his own book, ''Green Lantern''. He also appeared in ''[[All Star Comics]]'' as a member of the superhero team known as the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]] the popularity of [[superhero]]es in general declined. The ''Green Lantern'' [[comic book]] was cancelled with issue #38 (May\u2013June 1949), and ''[[All Star Comics]]'' #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new [[Hal Jordan]] character who had been created to supplant him (see below).  Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series. Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \"Sentinel\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fiction Green Lanterns.\n\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \"the Green\").\n\n===Silver Age===\nIn 1959, [[Julius Schwartz]] reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named [[Hal Jordan]]. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different than the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the [[Green Lantern Corps]], an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the [[Guardians of the Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Albert|first=Aaron|url=http://comicbooks.about.com/od/greenlantern/p/glhaljordan.htm|title=Green Lantern - Hal Jordan Profile|accessdate=17 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117112607/http://comicbooks.about.com/od/greenlantern/p/glhaljordan.htm|archivedate=17 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Showcase 22.png|200px|thumb|right|Cover to ''Showcase'' #22 (October 1959), the first appearance of [[Hal Jordan]].]]\n\nHal Jordan was introduced in ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' #22 (September\u2013October 1959).

Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of [[Dennis O'Neil|Denny O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]] to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character [[Green Arrow]] (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled ''Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow'') and had the pair travel through America encountering \"real world\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways \u2014 Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]]. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \"[[Snowbirds Don't Fly]]\" story was published (issues #85 and #86) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] (the later grown-up hero [[Roy Harper (comics)|Red Arrow]]) developed a [[heroin]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[Newsweek]]'' citing it as an example of how comic books were \"growing up\".<ref>Wright, Bradford W. ''Comic Book Nation''. Johns Hopkins, 2001. p. 227</ref> However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as backups in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #217-219.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Wells|first= John|date= December 2010|title= Green Lantern/Green Arrow: And Through Them Change an Industry|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 39\u201354|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\nThe title saw a number of revivals and cancellations. It changed to ''Green Lantern Corps'' at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, [[Kyle Rayner]], was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], then died and came back as the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]].\n\nIn the wake of ''[[DC: The New Frontier|The New Frontier]]'', writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' (2004\u201305). Johns began to lay groundwork for \"[[Blackest Night]]\" (released July 13, 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401227864 |title=Green Lantern: Blackest Night (9781401227869): Geoff Johns, Doug Mahnke: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by ''Rebirth''. Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \"[[Sinestro Corps War]]\" (2007), Johns, with artist [[Ethan van Sciver]], found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \"lanterns\".\n\n===Awards===\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 [[Alley Award]] for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/alley61.php|title=1961 Alley Awards|accessdate=22 November 2011|year=2006|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac}}</ref> and the [[Academy of Comic Book Arts]] [[Shazam Award]] for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\", ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2, #76, by [[Dennis O'Neil]] and [[Neal Adams]]),<ref name=\"Shazam1970\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/shazam70.php|title=1970 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards\n|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac|year=2006|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref> and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\", ''Green Lantern'' vol. 2, #85 by O'Neil and Adams).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/shazam71.php|title=1971 Academy of Comic Book Arts Awards\n|author=Joel Hahn|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac|year=2006|accessdate=22 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on ''Green Lantern'', ''[[Batman]]'', ''[[Superman]]'', and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on ''Green Lantern'' and ''Batman''.<ref name=\"Shazam1970\"/> Inker [[Dick Giordano]] received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on ''Green Lantern'' and other titles.<ref name=\"Shazam1970\"/>\n\nIn [[Judd Winick]]'s first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in Green Lantern #137 (June 2001).

The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death (a lamp-maker named Luke Fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp; in fear and as punishment for what they thought [[sacrilege]], the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame), once to bring life (in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern; the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life), and once to bring power. By 1940, the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott, a young engineer. Following a railroad-bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime-fighter. Alan was a founding member of the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nAfter the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]] (although the original origin story was still in continuity), a later ''Tales of the Green Lantern Corps'' story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps' ranks, when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth's Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, a resident of China. Not only had the Corps' now-familiar green, black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted, but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen. Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern, as he attempted to rule over mankind, which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood, the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned. This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted \"champion\". His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the \"intelligence\" inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the Guardians was damaged. Over time, when it had occasion to manifest itself, this \"intelligence\" became known as the mystical 'Starheart' of fable.\n\nCenturies later, it was explained, when Scott found the mystical lantern, it had no memory of its true origins, save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master. This was the origin of Scott's distinctive costume. Due to its damaged link to them, the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record, thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps, sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood. Honoring this separate history, the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring, formally join the Corps, or adopt its colors. Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps, however, was hinted at in a Silver Age crossover story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the \"Brightest Day\" oath.  During the [[Rann-Thanagar War]], it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, DC Comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of Alan Scott as a gay man in the title \"Earth 2.\" The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012.<ref name=\"Reuters.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/01/us-gay-greenlatern-idUSBRE85017H20120601|title=Gay Green Lantern appears in alternate universe|author=Daniel Trotta|date=June 1, 2012|work=Reuters.com}}</ref> In its story, Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived; a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming Green Lantern. This alternate version is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his mystical powers derive  from the [[Parliament of Trees|Green]] (the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth).\n\n===Silver Age Green Lantern===\n\n==== Hal Jordan ====\n{{Main|Hal Jordan}}\n\nThe character of Harold \"Hal\" Jordan was a second-generation [[test pilot]], having followed in the footsteps of his father. He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] named [[Abin Sur]], whose [[Starship|spaceship]] crashed on [[Earth]]. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was \"utterly honest and born without fear\" to take his place as a member of the corps. At one point, when Hal Jordan was incapacitated, it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth, the other being [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur. Gardner then became listed as Hal's \"backup\", even though he had a strong friendship with Barry Allen (The Flash). Gardner would fill in if Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated. Later, when Gardner was put into a coma, it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task, [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], who was designated as the Earth Sector's \"backup\" Lantern. Jordan, as Green Lantern, became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid-2000s is, along with John Stewart, one of the two active-duty Lanterns in Earth's sector of space.\n\nJordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic \"police\" force which bears some similarities to the \"[[Lensman series|Lensmen]]\" from the science fiction series written by [[E. E. Smith|E.E. Smith]], although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith's stories.<ref name=\"Lensmen\">{{Cite news | last=Thomas | first=Roy | title=The Lensman Connection | periodical=Alter Ego | volume=3 | issue=10 | year=2001 | page=24 | postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->}}</ref> Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries \"Green Lantern Corps\" honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: [[List of Green Lanterns#Eddore|Eddore of Tront]] and [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]].\n\nFollowing the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern's hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s, Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery. Now calling himself [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe on and off for the next several years.  However, after Earth's sun was threatened by a Sun-Eater, Jordan sacrificed his life, expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star.  Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance, whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption, which ended in failure.\n\nIn ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] when he turned renegade.  Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past.  Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten, becoming known merely as the \"yellow impurity\" in the power rings. [[Sinestro]] was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host. Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan (via his ring) for some time, it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed. It took advantage of Jordan's weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way. After killing several Green Lanterns, Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power, unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul.\n\nThe Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern's soul from Parallax's taint, but was not strong enough to do so. In ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'', Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax-Spectre-Jordan composite. Thanks to a supreme effort of will, Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax, rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring. The newly revived (and rejuvenated) Jordan awoke just in time to save [[Kyle Rayner]] and [[Green Arrow]] from Sinestro. After the Korugarian's defeat, Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet, imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth's Lanterns, rendering the Green Lantern's rings free of the yellow impurity, provided they had the power of will to do so.\nHal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps, and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814, personally defeating Sinestro in the [[Sinestro Corps War]]. Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814.1.\n\nPost-''[[Sinestro Corps War]]'', [[DC Comics]] revisited the origin of [[Hal Jordan]] as a precursor to ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, the next chapter in the [[Geoff Johns]] era on ''Green Lantern''.\nHal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by [[Ryan Reynolds]] in the 2011 ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'' film.\n\n===Bronze Age Green Lanterns===\n<!-- Should this pair be listed in perceived importance or in publication order? -->\n\n====Guy Gardner====\n{{Main|Guy Gardner (comics)}}\n\nIn the late 1960s, Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814. Gardner was a candidate to receive Abin Sur's ring, but Jordan was closer. This placed him as the \"backup\" Green Lantern for Jordan.  But early in his career as a Green Lantern, tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face, putting him in a coma for years. During the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the Guardians split into factions, one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion. As a result of his years in a coma, Guy was emotionally unstable, although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly. He has gone through many changes, including wielding [[Sinestro]]'s yellow Guardian power ring, then gaining and losing [[Vuldarian]] powers, and readmission to the Corps during ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''. He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns. Gardner is designated as Green Lantern 2814.2 within the Corps.\n\nGuy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]''.\n\nFollowing his outstanding acts of valour, the Guardians appoint Guy to a unique role and highest rank in the Green Lantern Corps-Sentinel, answering directly to the Guardians themselves.\n\n====John Stewart====\n{{Main|John Stewart (comics)}}\n\n<!-- \"Bronze Age\" notation -->\nIn the early 1970s, John Stewart, an architect from [[Detroit]], was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan. When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time, Stewart served as the regular Lantern, coming into his own as he battled numerous Green Lantern villains and played a key role during the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]. During that time the Guardians of the Universe assigned [[Katma Tui]] to train Stewart, and the two developed romantic feelings for each other. They married, but Katma was soon murdered by longtime Green Lantern villain Star Sapphire. Stewart was crushed by this, and his life began to unravel. He reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet Xanshi from destruction during the [[Cosmic Odyssey (comics)|Cosmic Odyssey]].\n\nJohn Stewart redeemed himself during the [[Green Lantern: Mosaic|Mosaic]] crisis, when an insane Guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on Oa. When the Guardian was defeated, the cities remained, as the other Guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the Central Power Battery to send them home. While they gathered the resources, John Stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities. Using his intellect and unconventional thinking, he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society. He was aided by Rose Hardin, a farmer from West Virginia who was trapped on Oa, due to her town being abducted. Stewart once again found love with Rose, and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on Earth.\n\nStewart eventually deduced that the Guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted, and that they let them remain on Oa as an experiment in cosmic integration, and also as a test for John Stewart. Stewart passed the test, and discovered that he was a figure in Oan prophecy. That was why the Guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a Power Ring to do it, as is standard procedure. John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe. He was also rewarded with the resurrection of Katma Tui, which caused him to break up with Rose.\n\nStewart's new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when Hal Jordan went mad and became Parallax, absorbing the power from the Central Power Battery. During this time, the Green Lantern Corps was disbanded, and Stewart went on to lead the [[Darkstars]], a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the Controllers, offshoots of the Guardians of the Universe. During a battle, Stewart was badly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. Hal Jordan eventually restored his ability to walk before sacrificing himself to save Earth's sun. Soon after, John Stewart found himself hunted by a serial killer from Xanshi called [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]. She sought out any remnants of the Green Lantern Corps so that she might kill them in the name of avenging her doomed planet. Stewart fended off Fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body, which was in him due to Hal Jordan healing his crippling condition; however, this left him unable to walk again.\n\nStewart later visited Fatality while she was in custody, and she revealed to him that his back was fine, and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to. Stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to feeling guilty over his sister's death. Stewart overcame this condition and was given a power ring by Kyle Rayner. Rayner departed Earth and Stewart became the Green Lantern of Earth once again, and also a member of the Justice League of America.\n\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps reformed, Stewart began serving with Jordan as one of his sector's two designated regular-duty Lanterns, designated as Green Lantern 2814.3. Since then, he has played key roles in all big Green Lantern events, such as ''The Sinestro Corps War'' and ''Blackest Night''.\n\nIn the New 52 continuity, John Stewart was a U.S. Marine along with being an architect and the son of a social activist. He started a romantic relationship with his longtime enemy Fatality, who by that point had become a Star Sapphire and apparently forgave him for failing to save her world. In the events leading up to the \"Uprising\", Fatality was captured by shape-shifting Durlans, and a Durlan operative replicated her and took her place. John Stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship, but he eventually came to love Fatality, but it turns out that it had been the impostor by that point. In the final battle of the \"Uprising\", the impostor revealed itself as Verrat Din, an eons old Durlan, and destroyed Fatality's Star Sapphire ring, having no use for it after gaining the power of a Daxamite. Though Stewart defeated the powerful threat, he was shaken by having been misled so long, and having been intimate with a Durlan shape-shifter.\n\nStewart immediately set out to find the real Fatality, and when he did, he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him. Fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the Star Sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them. When her ring was destroyed, the spell was broken. Every moment she was with Stewart, she was trapped within herself. She revealed that she never loved John Stewart and departed, leaving Stewart emotionally crushed.\n\nJohn Stewart is notable for being the Green Lantern showcased on the [[Justice League (TV series)|''Justice League'']] and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' cartoon shows, as well as being the primary Green Lantern of the [[DC Animated Universe]].\n\n===Modern Age Green Lanterns===\n\n==== Kyle Rayner ====\n{{Main|Kyle Rayner}}\n\nKyle Rayner was a struggling freelance artist when he was approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, [[Ganthet]], to become a new Green Lantern with the very last power ring. Ganthet's reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time. Despite not being from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordan\u2014or perhaps because of that\u2014Rayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters. Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA, he became known amongst the Oans as ''The Torch Bearer''. He briefly operated as [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]] after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps. He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re-ignition of the Central Power Battery, essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax.\n\nKyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear, and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery. Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax. Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear, and yellow, none of the other Green Lanterns, including Hal, could harm Parallax and, therefore, came under his control. Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again.\n\nKyle became Ion, who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear. During the [[Sinestro Corps War]] between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps, Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle. In ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #24, Parallax consumes Hal Jordan.  Hal Jordan enters into Kyle's prison, and with his help, Kyle finally escapes Parallax.\n\nAfterward, [[Ganthet]] and [[Sayd]] trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth. Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again.  Kyle accepts, and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring. Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform.  Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard, and has been partnered with Guy Gardner.\n\nKyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of ''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''.  Corps rookie [[Sodam Yat]] took over the mantle of Ion. Sodam has made an appearance in the [[Legion of Super Heroes]] ''[[Final Crisis]]'' tie-in ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' as the last surviving Green Lantern/Guardian of the Universe.\n\nKyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814.4 within the Corps.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nKyle Rayner died in ''Green Lantern Corps'' #42 (Jan. 2010) after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps. The following issue, Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu's heart to his heart.\n[[File:Simon Baz with gun.jpg|thumb|[[Simon Baz]] as seen on the cover of Green Lantern #0 (November 2012).]]\n\n====Simon Baz====\n{{Main|Simon Baz}}\nSimon Baz is a [[Lebanese American]] [[Muslim]] from the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Dearborn, Michigan]].

He was caught by the police street racing in a stolen car with an armed bomb in the back of the van. While being questioned by authorities, Sinestro's Green Lantern ring chose Simon as its next ring bearer, recruiting him into the Green Lantern Corps. The squirrel-like Lantern B'dg follows, becoming Baz's mentor and friend. The [[Justice League]] eventually tracks Baz down and questions him as to how he came into the possession of a Green Lantern ring. Batman tries to disarm him by removing Simon's ring, but self-defense mechanisms of the ring prevent this.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Green Lantern v5 #14|date=Jan. 2013}}</ref>\nFollowing the events of \"Wrath of The First Lantern\",<ref>{{cite comic|title=Green Lantern v5 #17|date=Jan. 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|title=Green Lantern v5 #18|date=Mar. 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite comic|title=Green Lantern v5 #19|date=Apr. 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Green Lantern v5 #20\">{{cite comic|title=Green Lantern v5 #20|date=May. 2013}}</ref> Simon Baz was offered the opportunity to join Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor's \"Justice League of America\" under the pretense that his criminal charges would be dropped and his innocence publicly declared after FBI Agent Franklin Fed vouched for him.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Justice league of America v3 #1|date=Feb. 2013}}</ref> During the events of the \"Trinity War\" storyline, after Cyborg's (Victor) body was mangled by Crime Syndicate member \"The Grid\", Baz's ring was the only thing preventing Victor from death.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Justice League #27|date=Jan. 2014}}</ref> During the battle against Relic, when Lantern Guy Gardner and the Red Lantern Corps become the protectors of space sector 2814, Simon was appointed Green Lantern ambassador on earth by Hal Jordan.

Jessica Cruz is a young Latin American woman who was forced to become the unwilling host to the evil Ring of Volthoom after \"[[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]]\" dies in his alternate Earth universe. Though she is not technically \"Power Ring\", as she is not a member of the [[Crime Syndicate]] and has no association with the organization, for namesake purposes she is dubbed \"Power Ring\" while the ring uses her as a host. She is helped by the Justice League and Simon Baz, who help her understand her cursed powers. In the Darkseid War, she becomes trapped inside the Ring of Volthoom, as Volthoom himself takes over Jessica's body. She then battles the previous wearers of the ring with the help of Cyborg, and forces her body in front of the Black Racer (who at the time was controlling the Flash) and kills Volthoom. After the battle, whilst the League mourns her motionless body, a Green Lantern ring appears and Jessica is made the 6th Green Lantern of Earth, to everyone's surprise.\n\nIn ''Green Lantern: Rebirth'' #1, she meets up with Simon Baz to battle a Manhunter. This turns out to be an exercise controlled by [[Hal Jordan]], as he needs them to protect Earth whilst he goes on a mission to find the rest of the Corps. He then fuses both their Lanterns into one, which can only be used when they are together. Hal also gives them membership into the Justice League to help with their training.\n\n===Others who have headlined as Green Lantern in a Green Lantern Comic or related title===\n\n==== Jade ====\n{{Main|Jade (comics)}}\nThe daughter of Alan Scott, '''Jennifer-Lynn Hayden''' would discover she shared her father's mystical connection to the [[Alan Scott#Post Crisis and Ragnarok|Starheart]], which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern. Choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, she became the superheroine Jade. She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities. When Jade was fighting an Okaaran monster, she was saved by an orange lantern named Cade and fell in love with him.\n\nAfter Jade was stripped of her powers, Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan's power ring. When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps, Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet's Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain [[Fatality (comics)|Fatality]]. Later, when the ring was returned to her, she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner's. Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner, as Ion, used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart. During ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', she died while trying to stop [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse. Upon her death, Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner. In the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event, her remains have been reanimated as one of the [[Black Lantern Corps]] after receiving a black power ring. She was resurrected by the [[Life Entity]] along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members.\n\nFollowing the New 52 and DC Rebirth, she has been removed from continuity. This creates a major hole in Kyle Raynor's backstory as well, given how long they were together. She was later returned to continuity along with her father Alan Scott and the rest of the JSA during [[Doomsday Clock]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Thaal Sinestro====\n{{Main|Sinestro}}\nSinestro was born on the planet Korugar and became Green Lantern of space sector 1417. He was a friend of [[Abin Sur]] and mentor to Hal Jordan. His desire for order was an asset in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter what the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator. Exposed by Hal Jordan and punished, he later wielded a yellow ring of fear from [[Qward]]. Later in league with Parallax, he would establish the [[Sinestro Corps]], which began the [[War of Light]]. Following ''[[Blackest Night]]'' and ''[[War of the Green Lanterns]]'' Sinestro would once again receive a Green Lantern ring and temporarily headline the monthly ''Green Lantern'' following [[The New 52]]. In Scott Snyders Justice League it was revealed that Sinestro was searching for the entity, Umbrax, which is one of the seven hidden forces of the universe. Umbrax represents the unseen emotions of the Ultraviolet Lantern Corps. Sinestro finally discovers this force and creates and army of Ultraviolet lanterns including John Stewart (whom later gets freed.) \n \n{{Clear}}\n\n====Jediah Caul====\nPremiering in ''Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual'' #1, Caul is a deep undercover Green Lantern operative that works in the Tenebrian Dominion. He unwillingly helps Carol Ferris and the New Guardians attempt to petition [[Lady Styx]] to send aid against the Third Army. For betraying them, the New Guardians leave Caul behind and he is forced to become part of a reality program called \"The Hunted\", stripped of his powers and with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. Caul stars as part of an ensemble cast of spacebound DC characters including the [[Blue Beetle]] and a new [[Captain Carrot|Captain K'rot]] in the \"Hunted\" main feature of ''[[Threshold (DC Comics)|Threshold]]''. Caul received his Green Lantern Ring after he shot and killed its previous bearer, unsure himself why he was then chosen. Caul is able to save Sh'diki Borough on the planet Tolerance after it had been bottled by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. Caul is later informed that The Hunted has been canceled and offered the lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron, with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Lady Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by Colonel [[Tommy Tomorrow|T'omas T'morra]]. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show. However Caul is shown alive later along with Captain K'rot in tow when the planet Telos manifests during the 2015 \"[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]\" storyline, investigating it alongside Superman, Supergirl, Guy Gardner, and the Red Lanterns.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Sojourner \"Jo\" Mullein====\nIs a rookie Green Lantern who must investigate the first murder committed in City Enduring for the last 500 years. She headlines as Green Lantern in [[Far Sector]] published by DC Young Animal.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Others who have a supporting role as a Green Lantern===\n\n====Charles Vicker====\nCharlie Vicker was an actor who portrayed Green Lantern in a TV show on Earth. Charlie enjoyed his fame and happily threw himself into the life of a playboy television star. After one particularly grueling night of partying, Charlie was too hung over to show up on set so his brother Rodger had to go on as his stand in. Unfortunately for Roger, a group of various space criminals, led by former Earth criminal Al Magone, mistook the television Green Lantern for the real thing and attacked during a live broadcast. The criminals were ones previous imprisoned by the Green Lanterns on a special timeless criminal planet who had banded together and launched simultaneous attacks on Green Lanterns across the galaxy. By the time the real Green Lantern Hal Jordan arrived on the scene, the defenseless stand-in was dead and the criminal responsible was gone. Charlie was overcome with grief and blamed himself for his brother's death. He demanded that Hal Jordan bring him along in his hunt for the murderer responsible, so that Charlie could avenge his brother.\n\nEventually the two, along with the rest of the Green Lantern Corp tracked the criminals down and brought their terror to an end. During the battle, Green Lantern gave Vicker a power ring from one of the fallen Green Lanterns and appointed him a temporary Green Lantern. Vicker proved himself well enough that the Guardians of the Universe granted him his own Power Ring. He was assigned to Sector 3319 where the strange alien inhabitants made Vicker uncomfortable and alone. Just when he considered resigning from the Green Lantern Corps, Vicker saved an alien child from death. The child's mother was extremely grateful to Vicker making him realize that their physical differences hid how similar the aliens were to mankind.\n\nVicker would later use his skills as an actor to teach the natives of his sector the great plays of Earth. When an invasion force threatened his sector following the first destruction of the Central Power Battery, the now depowered Vicker raised and trained a resistance group that eventually repelled the invaders and ensured his adopted people's freedom. Vicker later joined John Stewart's Darkstars. He was killed during the battle with [[Grayven]], third son of Darkseid.\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Keli Quintela====\n[[Young Justice]] (vol. 3) #1 (March 2019) introduced Keli Quintela as Teen Lantern. An unofficial Green Lantern, Quintela is an eleven-year old from La Paz, Bolivia that recieved a Green Lantern power gauntlet similar to Krona's from a dying green lantern that she then modified and hacked to act like a Green Lantern power ring.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Main|Power ring (DC Comics)}}\nThe ring is powered by willpower. \nEach Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.\n\nEarly Green Lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring, from shrinking objects to turning people invisible. Later stories de-emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs.\n\nThe signature power of all Green Lanterns is the ability to conjure \"constructs:\" solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically.  These can be anything, such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, or chains to bind a prisoner. Whatever their shape or size, these constructs are always pure green in color, unless a Lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the EM spectrum the construct emits. Hal Jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under Batman's guidance.\n\nThe rings of the Green Lantern Corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances, fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe. They allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment, and also remove the need to eat, sleep and pass waste. The rings can translate practically any language in the universe.  They possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects. Lanterns are granted full access to all Guardian knowledge by their rings through the Book of Oa.\n\nA noteworthy power the rings '''do not''' have is the ability to automatically heal injuries, though they can provide shielding. In Hal Jordan's origin story, Abin Sur passed on his ring to Hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries. If the Green Lantern happens to be a skilled physician, then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool, but it cannot do much for a Lantern who lacks medical expertise. When Hal Jordan breaks his arm, the best he can do is conjure up a cast. This is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one's injured body with constructs, but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one's body and concentration enough to prolong the construct.\n\nAlan Scott's ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood. Alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly.  The rings of Hal Jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow, though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the Central Battery on Oa, more recent stories have removed this weakness.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will beat a weaker-willed Lantern in a duel.  Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, may render his ring useless.\n\n==Green Lantern Oath==\nGreen Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring. Originally, the oath was:\n\n{{poemquote|\n... and I shall shed my light over dark evil.\nFor the dark things cannot stand the light,\nThe light of the Green Lantern!|Alan Scott}}\n\nThis oath is also used by Lanterns [[Tomar-Re]] of sector 2813 and Chief Administrator [[Salaak]].<ref>''Green Lantern Corps'' #206</ref>\nIn the mid-1940s, this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nNo evil shall escape my sight!\nLet those who worship evil's might\nBeware my power, Green Lantern's light!|Hal Jordan/many current Lanterns}}\n\nThe oath in this form is credited to [[Alfred Bester]],<ref>{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Julius |authorlink= Julius Schwartz |title= Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics |url= https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw |url-access= registration |location= New York |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |year= 2000 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manoftwoworldsmy00schw/page/67 67\u201368] |ISBN= 0-380-810514}}</ref> who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s. This version of the oath was first spoken by Alan Scott in ''Green Lantern'' #9 from the fall of 1943. Scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the Silver Age.\n\nMany Green Lanterns have a unique personal oath, but some oaths are shared by several Lanterns. They are usually four lines long with a [[rhyme scheme]] of \"AAAA\" or \"AABB\".\n\nThe [[Pre-Crisis]] version of Hal Jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals: in the first adventure, he used his ring as [[radar]] to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash; in the second, he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with [[phosphorescence]]; finally, Jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used.\n\n[[Medphyll]], the Green Lantern of the planet J586 (seen in ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' #61, \"All Flesh is Grass\"), a planet where a sentient plant species lives, has the following oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn forest dark or glade beferned,\nNo blade of grass shall go unturned!\nLet those who have the daylight spurned\nTread not where this green lamp has burned!}}\n\nOther notable oaths include that of [[Jack T. Chance]],\n\n{{poemquote|\nYou who are wicked, evil and mean,\nI'm the nastiest creep you've ever seen!\nCome one, come all, put up a fight,\nI'll pound your butts with Green Lantern's light!\nYowza!}}\n\nand that of [[Rot Lop Fan]], a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight, and thus has no concepts of brightness, darkness, day, night, color, or lanterns.\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn loudest din or hush profound,\nMy ears catch evil's slightest sound!\nLet those who toll out [[evil]]'s knell\nBeware my power, the [[Musical scale|F-Sharp]] [[Bell (instrument)|Bell]]!}}\n\nIn ''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #27, the [[Alpha Lanterns]] use the oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn days of peace, in nights of war,\nObey the Laws forever more!\nMisconduct must be answered for,\nSwear us the chosen: The Alpha Corps!}}\n\nIn ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of 3 Worlds]]'', [[Sodam Yat]] in the 31st century \u2013 the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians \u2013 recited a new oath:\n\n{{poemquote|\nIn brightest day, through [[The Blackest Night|Blackest Night]],\nNo other Corps shall spread its light!\nLet those who try to stop what's right\nBurn like my power, Green Lantern's light!}}\n\nIn ''Batman: The Dawnbreaker'' #1, the Dawnbreaker (an amalgamation of Batman and Green Lantern from the Dark Multiverse's Earth-32) creates and recites his own oath after the death of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps by his own hands:\n\n{{poemquote|\nWith darkness black, I choke the light!\nNo brightest day escapes my sight!\nI turn the dawn to midnight!\nBeware my power--Dawnbreaker's might!}}\n\nIn ''The Green Lantern'' #11, written by [[Grant Morrison]], several distinct oaths were used by the Green Lanterns of the Multiverse.
