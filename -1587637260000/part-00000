Previously, McDonald's poutine was available widely only in Francophone Canada (Quebec and parts of New Brunswick) and available elsewhere on a more limited basis; however, in December 2013, McDonald's formally announced the nationwide availability of poutine at all of its Canadian restaurants, due to popular demand.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcdonald-s-poutine-hitting-menus-across-canada-1.2454323 \"McDonald's poutine hitting menus across Canada\"], CBC News, 06 December 2013.</ref> Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise.

The crispy chicken patty used in the McChicken sandwich sold in Canada uses both white and dark meat \u2013 it is essentially the same size and taste as the original McChicken that first appeared in the US in 1980.\n\nSeasonal items previously available in McDonald's in Canada include the McLobster, a [[lobster roll]], available in the [[Maritime Provinces]], called ''McHomard'' in French.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-biz-mcdonalds-mchomard-canada,0,4348743.photo | work=Chicago Tribune | title=McHomard \u2013 Canada}}</ref> Regionally a blueberry-shortbread McFlurry is also available.  Discontinued items in Canadian McDonald's include pizzas, including a [[calzone]]-style \"McPizza.\"\nThe McFlurry Originated in New Brunswick.\n\n===Mexico===\nMexican McDonald's locations do not serve fish, except during the period of Lent. Special items at these locations have included the Flaming Hot [[Doritos]] Quarter Pounder and the BBQ Double Burger.

Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\nUnlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger.

The McLavash is also served in some other nearby countries.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\nBritish and Irish McDonald's serve the Chicken Legend, a chicken breast coated in seasoned batter either spicy tomato salsa, BBQ Sauce or mayonnaise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.co.uk/content/ukhome/product_nutrition.chicken.243.chicken-legend-with-bacon-cool-mayo.html |title=Product Nutrition |publisher=McDonalds.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In June 2011, [[Deli Choices]], a line of sandwich rolls with fillings, was released in the UK. [[Curry]] flavoured sauce is available for McNuggets in British and Irish restaurants. From 2003 to 2005, menus included the [[Quorn (food product)|Quorn]] Premiere, a vegetarian burger with sweet chilli sauce, light [[Hellmann's and Best Foods|Hellmann's]] mayonnaise, tomato, and lettuce in a [[focaccia]] bun. In 2015, McDonald's released a limited edition burger in the Republic of Ireland called the McM\u00f3r. In 2016, this burger was brought back for six weeks. It features Ballymaloe Relish, Charleville cheddar and a potato bun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdonalds.ie/iehome/food/full_menu/beef/mc-mor.html |title=McM\u00f3r burger |publisher=McDonalds.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-04-20}}</ref> In 2016, McDonald's launched the brand new BBQ Smokehouse Range of burgers. The two burgers that were launched contained chicken and beef with bacon, cheese and BBQ Sauce.\n\nPast promotional items have included the Apple Pie Sundae, [[Mozzarella sticks|Mozzarella Dippers]], ''Cheese Melt Dippers'', the ''Summer Chorizo Supreme'', BBQ Chicken Premiere with Bacon, the ''1955 burger'', Apple and Blackberry Pie and the ''Festive Pie'', with [[mincemeat]] and [[custard]]. A series of burgers intending to represent various American locales has been released under the ''Great Taste of America'' range. These burgers have represented New York City, Chicago, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Texas]], [[Arizona]], Miami, California and [[New Orleans]]. Not all of these burgers resemble their respective local cuisines.<ref>{{cite news |title=McDonald's Introduces the UK to Incorrect Tastes of America |last=Wheeler |first=Robin |url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |newspaper=[[The Riverfront Times]] |date=6 June 2011 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527012859/http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/gutcheck/2011/06/mcdonalds_introduces_the_uk_to.php |archive-date=2012-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> British and Irish McDonald's also released a series of burgers representing several different countries in the world. These have included Australia, South Africa, Canada and Mexico. Several Summer and Winter menus have been launched. Also, McDonald's has launched several kinds of McFlurrys over the years, such as [[Cornetto (ice cream)|Cornetto]], [[Cadbury]] brands like Dairy Milk (which is available all year around) and the [[Creme Egg]], which is only available around [[Easter]].\n\nIn 2019 McDonald's released a limited-time edition of the Big Mac called the ''Grand Big Mac Bacon'', which is essentially a larger Big Mac with added bacon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Big Mac Bacon|date=2019-01-28|accessdate=2019-01-31|url=https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/product/grand-big-mac-bacon.html}}</ref>\n\nMcDonald's UK also offers a range of premium burgers known as the ''Signature Collection'', consisting of three burgers: ''The Classic'', ''The Spicy'' and ''The BBQ''. Each comes with a thicker patty made from higher quality beef which takes longer to cook and is served on a brioche bun.\n\n==North America==\n===Canada===\n{{Main|McDonald's Canada}}\nFrench fries may be substituted with McDonald's version of [[poutine]]. Previously, McDonald's poutine was available widely only in Francophone Canada (Quebec and parts of New Brunswick) and available elsewhere on a more limited basis; however, in December 2013, McDonald's formally announced the nationwide availability of poutine at all of its Canadian restaurants, due to popular demand.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/mcdonald-s-poutine-hitting-menus-across-canada-1.2454323 \"McDonald's poutine hitting menus across Canada\"], CBC News, 06 December 2013.</ref> Quebec also saw the release of the limited-time 1967 Burger, commemorating Canada's first McDonald's franchise. Deli Choices were introduced throughout Canada in 2006. Unique to Canadian McDonald's locations is the McMini, miniature sandwiches with grilled or crispy chicken; flavors include [[Pesto]] Chicken (later replaced by Zesty [[Mango]]) and Spicy Thai.<ref>{{cite web|author=SirJman |url=http://www.travellingmcds.com/2011/11/mcmini-thai-chilli-chicken-and-pesto.html |title=McDonald's Around the World: Chicken McMini Thai Chilli and Pesto \u2013 Lasalle, Canada \u2013 May 2010 |publisher=Travellingmcds.com |date=2011-11-05 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> As in the United States, the McRib periodically appears on the menu for limited runs.  The crispy chicken patty used in the McChicken sandwich sold in Canada uses both white and dark meat \u2013 it is essentially the same size and taste as the original McChicken that first appeared in the US in 1980.\n\nSeasonal items previously available in McDonald's in Canada include the McLobster, a [[lobster roll]], available in the [[Maritime Provinces]], called ''McHomard'' in French.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-biz-mcdonalds-mchomard-canada,0,4348743.photo | work=Chicago Tribune | title=McHomard \u2013 Canada}}</ref> Regionally a blueberry-shortbread McFlurry is also available.  Discontinued items in Canadian McDonald's include pizzas, including a [[calzone]]-style \"McPizza.\"\nThe McFlurry Originated in New Brunswick.\n\n===Mexico===\nMexican McDonald's locations do not serve fish, except during the period of Lent. Special items at these locations have included the Flaming Hot [[Doritos]] Quarter Pounder and the BBQ Double Burger. For breakfast, Mexican McDonald's locations serve the McMollete, which is made on an English muffin spread with beans, topped with a slice of melted cheese and pico de gallo.<ref name=johnson>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-caters-to-local-palettes-2011-1?op=1|accessdate=3 August 2012|title=Check out the awesome meals you can buy at McDonald's around the world|author=Johnson, Robert|date=22 January 2011|work=Business Insider}}</ref> Mexican locations also serve a version of the McSkillet burrito known as the \"McBurrito\".\n\n===United States===\nMcDonald's restaurants in the United States of America offer various types of [[shellfish]] dishes on a regional basis, such as seasonal [[lobster]] rolls in [[New England]] and [[crab cakes]] in the [[Mid-Atlantic states]]. Parts of the [[Upper Midwest]] sell [[Johnsonville Foods|Johnsonville Brats]], a toasted hot dog bun with a Johnsonville [[bratwurst]] topped with spicy mustard and onions. Other regional variations include the [[Texas]] Homestyle Burger, and traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern]] breakfast items, such as a [[country ham]] biscuit and [[biscuits and gravy]].  Locations in the Southwest regularly offer burgers topped with [[New Mexico chile]].\n\nHawaii locations offer [[saimin]] on their regular menu,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tastyislandhawaii.com/2010/06/26/mcdonalds-saimin/ |title=McDonald\u2019s Saimin &#124; The Tasty Island |publisher=Tastyislandhawaii.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> and include [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[lingui\u00e7a|Portuguese sausage]] and [[rice]] as a breakfast option. Pineapple and taro pies, as regularly sold in some Asian countries, have been occasionally offered on the regular menu, along with [[haupia]] pies; pineapple is also sometimes available as a topping on burgers. In [[Waikiki]] locations, small trays of pineapple can be ordered as a side dish. Except for saimin, Hawaiian and selected Asian specialty items can also be found in McDonald's in the US territories of [[Guam]] and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands|Northern Mariana Islands]]. During Easter time, Hawaii, Guam and the CNMI all feature the Double Filet-O-Fish meal due to having a heavy concentration of Catholics (mostly people who immigrated from the Philippines) in that region.\n\n====Puerto Rico====\nUnlike Mexico, several Puerto Rican McDonald's restaurants serve fish products, although fish is not listed on McDonald's Puerto Rico's official website. Puerto Rican restaurants also serve the McCriollo (with eggs and cheese) for breakfast. Criollo is a Puerto Rican bread, like a baguette, but bigger and softer. Basically, the McCriollo is a sandwich with ham, cheese, and egg on a Criollo roll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandwichreviews.com/2010/06/mccriollo-puerto-rican-egg-mcmuffin.html |title=It's What's Between: McCriollo: The Puerto Rican Egg McMuffin |publisher=Sandwichreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\nA popular Australian McDonald's menu item is the McOz Burger. Previous products have included: Shaker Fries, similar to Japan's Shaka Shaka Chicken, and has had many variants of seasoning ranging from Cheeseburger, Big Mac and Spicy; a [[BLT]]; the Mc[[Beefsteak]], promoted by [[country music]] singer [[Lee Kernaghan]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3WCXJOpv4 |title=McDonalds Commercial \u2013 McBeefsteak |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> the Big [[Kahuna]] Burger, served with pineapple; the Romano Burger, a chicken patty with Italian sauce and mozzarella served on an herbed focaccia bun; the [[Tandoor]]i Burger, a chicken patty with lettuce and mint yogurt sauce served on flatbread; and a [[Chive]] [[Omelette]] Roll.\n\nCurrent products have included: Chicken Mcbites, Classic Angus and Aussie BBQ Angus.\n\nEvery so often (typically once a year) the McOz is sold for a limited time.  The McOz is a quarter-pounder burger with lettuce, tomato, cheese, mustard, ketchup and the so-called Australian ingredients of [[beetroot]] and cooked onion served on a sesame seed bun.\n\nThe El Maco burger, offered in other markets, was released for a limited time offer last on the 27th of November 2019. These burgers launch alongside Mozzarella Sticks served with El Maco Salsa and an El Maco variant Shaker Fries.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|McDonald's New Zealand}}\n[[File:McDonald's Kiwiburger.jpg|thumb|200px|Kiwiburger]]\nMany McDonald's menu items in New Zealand are similar to those in Australia. Some unique items include the [[Kiwiburger]], a beef patty with McMuffin egg, tomato, lettuce, cheese, onion, beetroot, ketchup, and mustard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestadsontv.com/ad/38826/McDonalds-Kiwiburger |title=TV ad: McDonald's: Kiwiburger |publisher=Bestadsontv.com |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2012-08-14}}</ref> In 2011, a special \"Kiwi Menu\" was featured to promote the country's hosting of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].\n\nIn April 2012, McDonald's re-released the El Maco, a variant of the product of the same name offered in other markets, such as Scandinavia.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.

However, after some time, the airline realised they were making losses on the tickets, with the ticketholders costing them up to $1 million each. Ticketholders were booking large amounts of flights, and some ticketholders flying interstate for lunch or flying to London multiple times a month.

However, the smoke on Flight 132 was caused by improperly packaged hazardous materials. According to the [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] inquiry, the cockpit crew persistently refused to acknowledge that there was a serious threat to the aircraft or the passengers, even after they were told that floor was becoming soft and passengers had to be reseated. As a result, the aircraft was not evacuated immediately on landing, exposing the crew and passengers to the threat of smoke and fire longer than necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a02a/6b1ff0725d682e3ab0fa55681a1db46af4ad.pdf|title=Chute, Rebecca D., and Earl L.

The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways.  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2001/01/10/deals/amr_twa/|title=TWA to be bought by American - Jan. 10, 2001|website=money.cnn.com|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAmerican had a direct role in the development of the [[DC-3]], which resulted from a marathon telephone call from American Airlines CEO [[C. R. Smith]] to Donald Douglas, when Smith persuaded a reluctant Douglas to design a sleeper aircraft based on the [[DC-2]] to replace American's [[Curtiss T-32 Condor II|Curtiss Condor II]] biplanes. (The existing DC-2's cabin was {{convert|66|in|m}} wide, too narrow for side-by-side berths.) Douglas agreed to go ahead with development only after Smith informed him of American's intention to purchase 20 aircraft. The prototype DST ([[Douglas Sleeper Transport]]) first flew on December 17, 1935, (the 32nd anniversary of the [[Wright Brothers]]' flight at Kitty Hawk). Its cabin was {{convert|92|in|m|abbr=on}} wide, and a version with 21 seats instead of the 14\u201316 sleeping berths of the DST was given the designation DC-3. There was no prototype DC-3; the first DC-3 built followed seven DSTs off the production line and was delivered to American Airlines.<ref>Pearcy, Arthur. ''Douglas DC-3 Survivors, Volume 1''.
