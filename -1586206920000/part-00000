Members of the Study Group and staff spoke with officials from various governments, seeking their views regarding the state of Iraq.\n\nAs a matter of political expediency, the group did not assign blame or causality for the state of Iraq's security, by focus on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|Occupation of Iraq]], or subsequent actions taken by the [[U.S. Military]]. It researched and outlined problems in Iraq, how such problems relate to each other, and what steps could be taken to fix the problems.\n\n==Pre-release expectations==\nThe public expected the ISG to present two overall, alternative policies in their report. The first option, \"Redeploy and Contain,\" would call for the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops to bases near Iraq where they could be redeployed against new threats in the region.<ref name=Devika>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2407482.html|title=US panel to propose Iraq policy U-turn|author=Devika Bha|work=The Sunday Times|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-17 |location=London}}</ref> ''Stability First'' would call for maintaining a presence in [[Baghdad]] and encouraging insurgents to enter the political arena, while asking [[Iran]] and [[Syria]], Iraq's neighbors, for help ending the fighting.<ref name=Devika/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fg-planb16oct16,1,5677446.story|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127112933/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fg-planb16oct16,1,5677446.story|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 27, 2013|title=Panel to Seek Change on Iraq|author=[[Doyle McManus]]|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the report would call for a gradual pullback of [[United States|American]] forces from Iraq beginning in 2007.<ref name=sanger>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/world/middleeast/30policy.html|title=15 Brigades Would Gradually Stand Down Under Plan|author=David Sanger and David S.

Its central points had for the most part been reported on before its release. The report deals with domestic issues such as budget funding and economic processes, military issues including bringing U.S. troops out of Iraq and how to integrate more of them into Iraqi army units, the foreign political issues of nurturing an effective and unified Iraqi government, and diplomatic issues such as calling for direct talks with Iran and Syria.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6215290.stm \"Iraq panel demands urgent change,\"] BBC News. December 7, 2006, accessed December 7, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe report begins by laying out the difficulties surrounding the Iraq war and the current U.S. position. It warns that its policy recommendations are not failsafe, but that the deteriorating situation in Iraq could lead to political and humanitarian consequences if not dealt with immediately.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6212918.stm Iraq Study Group report: Excerpt,\"]\" BBC News.

Only five pages of the report address U.S. troop levels, however: \"More than 30 pages of the report consist of biographies of commission members and lists of people they interviewed; we counted just five pages devoted to the matter of U.S. troop levels in Iraq. ...\"<ref name=WashTimes>{{cite web |title=A bipartisan path to surrender? |work=The Washington Times |date=December 7, 2006|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/op-ed/20061206-095730-9143r.htm |accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> Increasing those levels was not considered in depth as it was not considered a viable option.

October 2006 was the deadliest month for U.S. forces since January 2005, with 102 Americans killed. Total attacks in October 2006 averaged 180 per day, up from 70 per day in January 2006. Daily attacks against Iraqi security forces in October were more than double the level in January. Attacks against civilians in October were four times higher than in January. Some 3,000 Iraqi civilians are killed every month. (3)</blockquote>\n\nIn the same chapter, discussing \"'''U.S., Coalition, and Iraqi Forces''',\" the report suggests several causes for these consequences, chiefly the difficulties facing \"the Multi-National Forces\u2013Iraq under U.S. command, working in concert with Iraq's security forces,\" in\n\"confronting this violence.\" In its subsection on the \"Iraqi Forces,\" the report observes that while \"The Iraqi Army is making fitful progress toward becoming a reliable and disciplined fighting force loyal to the national government,\" some \"significant questions remain about the ethnic composition and loyalties of some Iraqi units\u2014specifically, whether they will carry out missions on behalf of national goals instead of a sectarian agenda\" (8), detailing these problems (8\u20139). The Report observes, for example, a significant gap in funding for the Iraq defense forces: \"The entire appropriation for Iraqi defense forces for FY 2006 ($3 billion) is less than the United States currently spends in Iraq every two weeks\" (9). It observes that the Iraqi Army \"is also confronted by several other challenges\": the \"units\" of the Iraqi Army lack adequate \"leadership,\" \"equipment,\" \"personnel,\" \"logistics and support,\" including \"the ability to sustain their operations,\" \"the capability to transport supplies and troops and the capacity to provide their own indirect fire support, technical intelligence, and medical evacuation.\" The Iraq Study Group predicts that the Iraqi Army \"will depend on the United States for logistics and support through at least 2007.\"<ref>\"Assessment of the Current Situation in Iraq: Security: The Iraqi Army\" (Section I.A.1), in ''The Iraq Study Group Report'' 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic concerns===\nThe report also presents the \"goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates to the regional players\":\n\n<blockquote>\nRecommendation 2: The goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates to regional players should be to:<br><br>\n# Support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n# Stop destabilizing interventions and actions by Iraq's neighbors.\n# Secure Iraq's borders, including the use of joint patrols with neighboring countries.\n# Prevent the expansion of the instability and conflict beyond Iraq's borders.\n# Promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, political support, and, if possible, military assistance for the Iraqi government from non-neighboring Muslim nations.\n# Energize countries to support national political reconciliation in Iraq.\n# Validate Iraq's legitimacy by resuming diplomatic relations, where appropriate, and reestablishing embassies in Baghdad.\n# Assist Iraq in establishing active working embassies in key capitals in the region (for example, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n# Help Iraq reach a mutually acceptable agreement on [[Iraqi Kurdistan#The Kirkuk question|Kirkuk]].\n# Assist the Iraqi government in achieving certain security, political, and economic milestones, including better performance on issues such as national reconciliation, equitable distribution of oil revenues, and the dismantling of militias.</blockquote>\n\nIn this report, however, the goals of the United States take precedence over the interests of the population of Iraq:\n\n<blockquote>Recommendation 41: The United States must make it clear to the Iraqi government that the United States could carry out its plans, including planned redeployments, even if Iraq does not implement its planned changes. America's other security needs and the future of our military cannot be made hostage to the actions or inactions of the Iraqi government.</blockquote>\n\n===Economic concerns===\nThe report focuses heavily on the oil industry in Iraq.\n\nFor example, according to Recommendation 62 in part:\n\n<blockquote>As soon as possible, the U.S. government should provided technical assistance to the Iraqi government to prepare a draft oil law that defines the rights of regional and local governments and creates a fiscal and legal framework for investment. help draft an oil law that creates a fiscal and legal framework for investment.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In conjunction with the [[International Monetary Fund]], the U.S. government should press Iraq to continue reducing subsidies in the energy sector, instead of providing grant assistance. Until Iraqis pay market prices for oil products, drastic fuel shortages will remain.</blockquote>\n\nRecommendation 63 says in part that\n\n<blockquote>The United States should encourage investment in Iraq's oil sector by the international community and by international energy companies.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The United states should assist Iraqi leaders to reorganize the national oil industry as a commercial enterprise, in order to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability.</blockquote>\n\nTheir report also notes that corruption may be more responsible for breakdowns in the oil sector than the insurgency itself:\n\n<blockquote>Corruption is also debilitating. Experts estimate that 150,000 to 200,000\u2014and perhaps as many as 500,000\u2014barrels of oil per day are being stolen. </blockquote>\n\n===Suggested flaws in some alternative courses===\nThe report outlines three alternative courses that have been suggested and explains possible flaws in these courses:\n\n'''Precipitate Withdrawal'''\n\n<blockquote>Because of the importance of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. [[Al Qaeda]] would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.</blockquote>\n\n'''Staying the Course'''\n\n<blockquote>Current U.S. policy is not working, as the level of violence in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United States is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among Iraqis who believe they are subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, \"Our leaving would make it worse. ... The current approach without modification will not make it better.</blockquote>\n\n'''More Troops for Iraq'''\n\n<blockquote>[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|Sustained increases]] in U.S. troop levels would not solve the fundamental cause of violence in Iraq, which is the absence of national reconciliation. A senior American general told us that adding U.S. troops might temporarily help limit violence in a highly localized area. However, past experience indicates that the violence would simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are moved to another area. As another American general told us, if the Iraqi government does not make political progress, \"all the troops in the world will not provide security.\" Meanwhile, America's military capacity is stretched thin: we do not have the troops or equipment to make a substantial, sustained increase in our troop presence. Increased deployments to Iraq would also necessarily hamper our ability to provide adequate resources for our efforts in [[Afghanistan]] or respond to crises around the world.</blockquote>\n\n===Some other concerns===\n\n====Underreporting of violence in Iraq====\nThe report also finds that the U.S. government intentionally misled the world by systematically distorting information about the violence in Iraq. As Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reports:\n\n<blockquote>The panel pointed to one day last July when U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence. Yet a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light 1,100 acts of violence. The standard for recording attacks acts as a filter to keep events out of reports and databases ... Good policy is difficult to make when information is systematically collected in a way that minimizes its discrepancy with policy goals.<ref>Robert Burns, \"[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_iraq_violence_figures Panel: U.S. Underreported Iraq Violence,\"] ''[[Associated Press]]'' December 6, 2006.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reactions to the report==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nypostmonkeycover.jpg|left|thumb|150px| [[New York Post]] cover December 7, 2006.]] -->\nThe release of the report garnered swift and sometimes contentious reaction from across the political spectrum. In general, critics of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, including liberal media outlets and think tanks, applauded the report's recommendations, particularly those related to [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|troop withdrawal]] and increased diplomacy with Syria and Iran. Supporters of the war effort, including conservative media outlets and neoconservative [[think tanks]], were highly critical of the report.\n\n===Praise===\nLeading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] praised the report as a vindication of their longstanding criticisms of the war's progress, especially their calls for troop withdrawal. Speaker of the House designate [[Nancy Pelosi]] said that \"the bipartisan Iraq Study Group has concluded that the President's Iraq policy has failed and must be changed.\" Senator [[Evan Bayh]] (D-IN) echoed this sentiment, saying \"Today's report offers the kind of changes we need to improve the current situation in Iraq.\"<ref name=\"blogs.suntimes.com\">Sweet, Lynn.

Members of the Study Group and staff spoke with officials from various governments, seeking their views regarding the state of Iraq.\n\nAs a matter of political expediency, the group did not assign blame or causality for the state of Iraq's security, by focus on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|Occupation of Iraq]], or subsequent actions taken by the [[U.S. Military]]. It researched and outlined problems in Iraq, how such problems relate to each other, and what steps could be taken to fix the problems.\n\n==Pre-release expectations==\nThe public expected the ISG to present two overall, alternative policies in their report. The first option, \"Redeploy and Contain,\" would call for the phased withdrawal of U.S. troops to bases near Iraq where they could be redeployed against new threats in the region.<ref name=Devika>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-2407482.html|title=US panel to propose Iraq policy U-turn|author=Devika Bha|work=The Sunday Times|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-17 |location=London}}</ref> ''Stability First'' would call for maintaining a presence in [[Baghdad]] and encouraging insurgents to enter the political arena, while asking [[Iran]] and [[Syria]], Iraq's neighbors, for help ending the fighting.<ref name=Devika/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fg-planb16oct16,1,5677446.story|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130127112933/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-fg-planb16oct16,1,5677446.story|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 27, 2013|title=Panel to Seek Change on Iraq|author=[[Doyle McManus]]|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the report would call for a gradual pullback of [[United States|American]] forces from Iraq beginning in 2007.<ref name=sanger>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/world/middleeast/30policy.html|title=15 Brigades Would Gradually Stand Down Under Plan|author=David Sanger and David S.

The report deals with domestic issues such as budget funding and economic processes, military issues including bringing U.S. troops out of Iraq and how to integrate more of them into Iraqi army units, the foreign political issues of nurturing an effective and unified Iraqi government, and diplomatic issues such as calling for direct talks with Iran and Syria.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6215290.stm \"Iraq panel demands urgent change,\"] BBC News.

October 2006 was the deadliest month for U.S. forces since January 2005, with 102 Americans killed. Total attacks in October 2006 averaged 180 per day, up from 70 per day in January 2006. Daily attacks against Iraqi security forces in October were more than double the level in January. Attacks against civilians in October were four times higher than in January. Some 3,000 Iraqi civilians are killed every month. (3)</blockquote>\n\nIn the same chapter, discussing \"'''U.S., Coalition, and Iraqi Forces''',\" the report suggests several causes for these consequences, chiefly the difficulties facing \"the Multi-National Forces\u2013Iraq under U.S. command, working in concert with Iraq's security forces,\" in\n\"confronting this violence.\" In its subsection on the \"Iraqi Forces,\" the report observes that while \"The Iraqi Army is making fitful progress toward becoming a reliable and disciplined fighting force loyal to the national government,\" some \"significant questions remain about the ethnic composition and loyalties of some Iraqi units\u2014specifically, whether they will carry out missions on behalf of national goals instead of a sectarian agenda\" (8), detailing these problems (8\u20139). The Report observes, for example, a significant gap in funding for the Iraq defense forces: \"The entire appropriation for Iraqi defense forces for FY 2006 ($3 billion) is less than the United States currently spends in Iraq every two weeks\" (9). It observes that the Iraqi Army \"is also confronted by several other challenges\": the \"units\" of the Iraqi Army lack adequate \"leadership,\" \"equipment,\" \"personnel,\" \"logistics and support,\" including \"the ability to sustain their operations,\" \"the capability to transport supplies and troops and the capacity to provide their own indirect fire support, technical intelligence, and medical evacuation.\" The Iraq Study Group predicts that the Iraqi Army \"will depend on the United States for logistics and support through at least 2007.\"<ref>\"Assessment of the Current Situation in Iraq: Security: The Iraqi Army\" (Section I.A.1), in ''The Iraq Study Group Report'' 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic concerns===\nThe report also presents the \"goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates to the regional players\":\n\n<blockquote>\nRecommendation 2: The goals of the diplomatic offensive as it relates to regional players should be to:<br><br>\n# Support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq.\n# Stop destabilizing interventions and actions by Iraq's neighbors.\n# Secure Iraq's borders, including the use of joint patrols with neighboring countries.\n# Prevent the expansion of the instability and conflict beyond Iraq's borders.\n# Promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, political support, and, if possible, military assistance for the Iraqi government from non-neighboring Muslim nations.\n# Energize countries to support national political reconciliation in Iraq.\n# Validate Iraq's legitimacy by resuming diplomatic relations, where appropriate, and reestablishing embassies in Baghdad.\n# Assist Iraq in establishing active working embassies in key capitals in the region (for example, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n# Help Iraq reach a mutually acceptable agreement on [[Iraqi Kurdistan#The Kirkuk question|Kirkuk]].\n# Assist the Iraqi government in achieving certain security, political, and economic milestones, including better performance on issues such as national reconciliation, equitable distribution of oil revenues, and the dismantling of militias.</blockquote>\n\nIn this report, however, the goals of the United States take precedence over the interests of the population of Iraq:\n\n<blockquote>Recommendation 41: The United States must make it clear to the Iraqi government that the United States could carry out its plans, including planned redeployments, even if Iraq does not implement its planned changes. America's other security needs and the future of our military cannot be made hostage to the actions or inactions of the Iraqi government.</blockquote>\n\n===Economic concerns===\nThe report focuses heavily on the oil industry in Iraq.\n\nFor example, according to Recommendation 62 in part:\n\n<blockquote>As soon as possible, the U.S. government should provided technical assistance to the Iraqi government to prepare a draft oil law that defines the rights of regional and local governments and creates a fiscal and legal framework for investment. help draft an oil law that creates a fiscal and legal framework for investment.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In conjunction with the [[International Monetary Fund]], the U.S. government should press Iraq to continue reducing subsidies in the energy sector, instead of providing grant assistance. Until Iraqis pay market prices for oil products, drastic fuel shortages will remain.</blockquote>\n\nRecommendation 63 says in part that\n\n<blockquote>The United States should encourage investment in Iraq's oil sector by the international community and by international energy companies.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The United states should assist Iraqi leaders to reorganize the national oil industry as a commercial enterprise, in order to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability.</blockquote>\n\nTheir report also notes that corruption may be more responsible for breakdowns in the oil sector than the insurgency itself:\n\n<blockquote>Corruption is also debilitating. Experts estimate that 150,000 to 200,000\u2014and perhaps as many as 500,000\u2014barrels of oil per day are being stolen. </blockquote>\n\n===Suggested flaws in some alternative courses===\nThe report outlines three alternative courses that have been suggested and explains possible flaws in these courses:\n\n'''Precipitate Withdrawal'''\n\n<blockquote>Because of the importance of Iraq, the potential for catastrophe, and the role and commitments of the United States in initiating events that have led to the current situation, we believe it would be wrong for the United States to abandon the country through a precipitate withdrawal of troops and support. A premature American departure from Iraq would almost certainly produce greater sectarian violence and further deterioration of conditions, leading to a number of the adverse consequences outlined above. The near-term results would be a significant power vacuum, greater human suffering, regional destabilization, and a threat to the global economy. [[Al Qaeda]] would depict our withdrawal as a historic victory. If we leave and Iraq descends into chaos, the long-range consequences could eventually require the United States to return.</blockquote>\n\n'''Staying the Course'''\n\n<blockquote>Current U.S. policy is not working, as the level of violence in Iraq is rising and the government is not advancing national reconciliation. Making no changes in policy would simply delay the day of reckoning at a high cost. Nearly 100 Americans are dying every month. The United States is spending $2 billion a week. Our ability to respond to other international crises is constrained. A majority of the American people are soured on the war. This level of expense is not sustainable over an extended period, especially when progress is not being made. The longer the United States remains in Iraq without progress, the more resentment will grow among Iraqis who believe they are subjects of a repressive American occupation. As one U.S. official said to us, \"Our leaving would make it worse. ... The current approach without modification will not make it better.</blockquote>\n\n'''More Troops for Iraq'''\n\n<blockquote>[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|Sustained increases]] in U.S. troop levels would not solve the fundamental cause of violence in Iraq, which is the absence of national reconciliation. A senior American general told us that adding U.S. troops might temporarily help limit violence in a highly localized area. However, past experience indicates that the violence would simply rekindle as soon as U.S. forces are moved to another area. As another American general told us, if the Iraqi government does not make political progress, \"all the troops in the world will not provide security.\" Meanwhile, America's military capacity is stretched thin: we do not have the troops or equipment to make a substantial, sustained increase in our troop presence. Increased deployments to Iraq would also necessarily hamper our ability to provide adequate resources for our efforts in [[Afghanistan]] or respond to crises around the world.</blockquote>\n\n===Some other concerns===\n\n====Underreporting of violence in Iraq====\nThe report also finds that the U.S. government intentionally misled the world by systematically distorting information about the violence in Iraq. As Associated Press Military Writer Robert Burns reports:\n\n<blockquote>The panel pointed to one day last July when U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence. Yet a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light 1,100 acts of violence. The standard for recording attacks acts as a filter to keep events out of reports and databases ... Good policy is difficult to make when information is systematically collected in a way that minimizes its discrepancy with policy goals.<ref>Robert Burns, \"[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_iraq_violence_figures Panel: U.S. Underreported Iraq Violence,\"] ''[[Associated Press]]'' December 6, 2006.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Reactions to the report==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Nypostmonkeycover.jpg|left|thumb|150px| [[New York Post]] cover December 7, 2006.]] -->\nThe release of the report garnered swift and sometimes contentious reaction from across the political spectrum. In general, critics of the Bush Administration's handling of the war, including liberal media outlets and think tanks, applauded the report's recommendations, particularly those related to [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|troop withdrawal]] and increased diplomacy with Syria and Iran. Supporters of the war effort, including conservative media outlets and neoconservative [[think tanks]], were highly critical of the report.\n\n===Praise===\nLeading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] praised the report as a vindication of their longstanding criticisms of the war's progress, especially their calls for troop withdrawal. Speaker of the House designate [[Nancy Pelosi]] said that \"the bipartisan Iraq Study Group has concluded that the President's Iraq policy has failed and must be changed.\" Senator [[Evan Bayh]] (D-IN) echoed this sentiment, saying \"Today's report offers the kind of changes we need to improve the current situation in Iraq.\"<ref name=\"blogs.suntimes.com\">Sweet, Lynn.

{"title_page": "History of the Knights of Columbus and The Catholic University of America", "text_new": "The '''history of the Knights of Columbus and The Catholic University of America''' is one of \"a close and supportive relationship\" that dates back almost to the founding of the university.<ref name=\"Pike\"/> [[David M. O'Connell]], then-president of CUA, has said, \"It is difficult to speak about the progress of The Catholic University of America throughout its long history without, at the same time and in the same breath, mentioning the Knights of Columbus. So much of what CUA is today is the result of the generosity and support of the Knights of Columbus.\"<ref name=\"Inside 070825\"/>  The fourth rector of the University, Monsignor [[Thomas J. Shahan]], congratulated the Order for having founded a \"Knights of Columbus College\" after a particularly large donation saved the University after a rocky financial period.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}\n\n[[Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus|Supreme Knight]] [[Carl A. Anderson]] has added that \"The [[Knights of Columbus]] enjoys a long and well-regarded relationship with [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]].\"<ref name=\"mcgivney\"/>  Anderson formerly served on the Board of CUA's Trustees.\n\nO'Connell wrote a column for the Knights' magazine, Columbia, thanking the Knights for their assistance throughout the years on the 100th anniversary of the 1904 gift of $50,000, saying, \"I cannot imagine what The Catholic University of America would have done if it were not for the Knights of Columbus.\"\n\n==Early years==\nBoth the university and the order were founded in the 1880s, and they have been closely aligned ever since.  By 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] praised the Knights for the commitment to the faith, and singled out their contributions to the University as an example of it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=234}}\n\n===Keane Council===\nOn June 5, 1898, Keane Council 353 was established at the university, though in later years it moved off campus.<ref name=\"Pike\"/> It was instituted with 66 charter members, and [[Lawrence O. Murray]], [[Comptroller of the Currency]], as Grand Knight. It \"formed its nucleus in the Catholic University\", in the words of Philip Garrigan, one of Keane's founders and vice-rector of the university.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}} It was named for Irish-born Bishop [[John J. Keane (bishop)|John J. Keane]], first rector of the University (1889\u20131896), and later Archbishop of Dubuque, Iowa. First meetings were in the Typographical Temple, then move to Grand Army Hall on October 12, 1898, then to the Maccabee Temple the following June.\n\n===Chair of American History===\n[[File:Knights of Columbus check presentation to The Catholic University of America.jpg|thumb|The Knights of Columbus presented a check to The Catholic University of America on the steps of the university's McMahon Hall in 1904 to establish a Chair of American History.]]\nOn March 7, 1899 Vice Rector and Knight Phillip Garrigan addressed the National Council, as the Supreme Convention was called at the time, asking for establishment of a Knights of Columbus Chair of American History at the University, to counter the somewhat anti-Catholic bias of history-writing at the time.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}} He said that \"we are attacked by anti-Catholic spokesmen on every side, partly because we have no historian among us.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}}  He added that while Protestant historians \"do not mean to be unfair... they cannot take Catholic facts and analyze them and give them the mainspring of the action and estimate fairly the character of the men.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=143-144}}\n\nGarrison told the assembled convention that his vision was for the historian who took the chair to be of such high stature that \"the defamer of Catholic truth will be silenced\" in his presence.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=144}}  He also mentioned to the Knights, the vast majority of whom were either born in Ireland or were of Irish descent, that the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] had recently donated $50,000 to establish a chair in Celtic Language and Literature.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=144}}\n\nThe convention enthusiastically accepted the proposal.  By March 5, 1901, Supreme Knight [[Edward L. Hearn]] reported unhappily to the national convention that only $10,000 has been collected  of the $50,000 commitment made two years earlier.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  It would take an additional three years to collect the total amount.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}\n\nOver 10,000 Knights were on hand on April 13, 1904 to present a $55,633.79 check ($1,399,831.80 in 2012 dollars<ref name=\"Inflation\"/>) to endow the Knights of Columbus Chair of American History to Cardinal [[James Gibbons]], Chancellor of the University and a strong supporter of the Knights.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>  The outdoor ceremony was held on the steps of the University's McMahon Hall.<ref name=\"Pike\"/> The gigantic check was ten feet high and four feet wide, and was beautifully executed on vellum in the style of an illuminated manuscript.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  It was later hang in the dining hall of the University Center West through the end of the century, and then in the newly renovated McGivney Hall after that.\n\nSupreme Knight Hearn, who viewed the Order as a sort of Catholic anti-defamation league, said at the presentation that \"non-Catholic historians... find no room in their histories to laud the magnificent work done in the early days of the nation by the Catholic missionaries and Catholic pioneers... These are the evils we seek to remedy by founding this Chair of American History.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=146}}\n\nThe check represented \"the Order's first response to a call from the American Church,\" which demonstrated to any doubters, and the early Knights did encounter opposition within the Church, that the Order was thoroughly Catholic.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}} A number of bishops were on hand for the presentation as well, which was the first time the American hierarchy gave such an ovation to the Order.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  The establishment of the Knights of Columbus Chair inaugurated the department of history of the University, but it was another five years before the new history program added other fields, with undergraduate courses in \"general history\" in 1909, and medieval history in 1914.\n\nThe first occupant of the chair was Dr. [[Charles Hallan McCarthy]].{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=227}}{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}  McCarthy, who studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], was teaching in a high school and was not a Knight, and thus was a controversial selection.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}  Some thought the position should go to John H. Ewing, a professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]] and the first state deputy of Indiana.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  McCarthy performed admiralty in the position however, and directed several graduate students who went on to great things, including [[Matthew J. Walsh]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}\n\n===Scholarships===\nIn December 1904, Cardinal Gibbons appealed to the Knights for more financial aid to help meet operating costs after some investments went sour, and the Order gave nearly $25,000.<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  In his letter, he referred to the Knights' \"princely munificence\" and added that \"I know that your bounty is limited only by your means.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  \n\nBy 1907 the financial situation of Catholic University had improved but was still shaky.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=147-8}}   Archbishop [[John J. Glennon]] of St. Louis, chairman of a committee to plan for a $500,000 endowment, appealed to the Knights as the committee believed the Order was the only organization which could raise such a large sum.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  On August 8th he addressed the national convention in Norfolk, urging the Order to \"fuse the activities of your Society into one grand movement that would stand out at the head of all Catholic National and Charitable movements in the United States.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  He added that doing so would \"give you the position your friends believe you are entitled to, namely the leading Catholic Society of the leading Catholic people of the United States.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}\n\nHearn did not endorse the proposal, and by at least one account seemed cool to the idea, but left it to the \"serious and careful thoughts of the delegates.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  The National Council accepted the idea in principal, although several proposals to raise the funds could not find enough support to pass.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=149}}  Eventually, Hearn was instructed to appoint a committee to settle the matter.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}\n\nAfter some delay, a committee was assembled in January 1908 and finally in December devised a plan that won the support of the Board of Directors in April 1909.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=150-151}}  Every Knight was mailed a letter and was asked to voluntarily contribute $1 a year for a five-year period.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}  On December 6, 1913 the goal was realized.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}\n\nAt Cardinal Gibbons's residence in Baltimore on January 6, 1914, a party headed by new Supreme Knight [[James A. Flaherty]] presented $500,000 in securities, the results of the fund drive for Catholic University.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/> The University and the Order agreed that rather than an endowment as originally planned, the funds would be used to establish fellowships for M.A. or Ph.D. studies with the hope of producing teachers for both Catholic and secular colleges and universities.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}  Originally there was to be one fellowship for every $10,000, with preference going to Knights or their families.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}} \n\nBy 1922, 146 K. of C. Fellowships had been awarded.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=152}}  In later years the funds permitted far fewer fellowships, which, in the words of the University's centennial history in 1990 \"have remained the most attractive fellowships under the control of the university despite drastic reductions in their number due to the effects of inflation upon university charges for tuition, board, and room.\"<ref name=\"Nuesse1990\"/>\n\nThe fellowships established by the Order, and the active interest shown by some members of the faculty in the Knights, made the University a good place to look for members. In February 1925, Washington Council arranged for a smoker at the University for faculty and students.  As a result, a Knights of Columbus Club was organized which in turn resulted in the initiation of about fifty students into the Council annually during the next few years. Some became officers.\n\n===Sun Bowl===\nAfter the [[1940 Sun Bowl]], Knights of Columbus in El Paso took the Cardinal football players over the border for lunch<ref name=Baugh/> in the \"squalid but colorful Mexican town\" of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].<ref name=squalid/>\n\n==Columbus School of Law==\nWith the success of its vocational courses in camps to prepare World War I veterans for civilian life, the Supreme Council established an Education Committee in June 1919.  This Committee later established a national tuition-free evening school program for veterans. By November, when the War Department took over the camp vocational courses from volunteer agencies, the Knights had nearly seven thousand students in twenty-five camps.  Washington Council Grand Knight Frank O'Hara, head of the economics department at the University, taught with other Knights teach in the Washington program, which focused on high school subjects. He later become dean of the school, and liberal arts and professional courses were added.{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=226}} \n \nIn 1921 Catholic University \"affiliated\" with the Knights of Columbus evening school for its college courses, and three years later also recognized its secondary school courses.  This allowed \"a large group of Catholic students who otherwise would go elsewhere to continue their studies\" to instead attend CUA, as the annual report of the rector stated. The school was located at St. John's College on Vermont Avenue, with 1,500 students registered, and a faculty of 24, of whom twenty were from the CUA. A committee of University trustees saw it as \"practically under University control, though not officially so.\"\n\nThe evening school had developed into Columbus University and obtained a charter in 1922. It was reported that the Order's Board of Directors was disassociating itself from the institution. Though there was appreciation among ecclesiastical officials of the service provided to those who couldn't regularly attend a university, there was also concern in the Catholic University administration about the confusion that could result from the close relationship between CUA and Columbus University. During this time there was a lessening of the role of the CUA teachers. O'Hara resigned as president of Columbus University and from its board, though he continued to teach, and there was a reduction of the course offerings to accounting and law. Sometime in the years 1923\u201325, the five councils of Washington D.C. voted on whether to keep the school open, with three favoring and two against.\n\nThree decades later, in 1954, Columbus University would merge with the law program of CUA to become The [[Columbus School of Law]] at The Catholic University of America<ref name=\"Pike\"/>  after the [[American Bar Association]] in 1951 challenged law schools not affiliated with a university. The CUA law school was the first professional school of the University, and occupied the remodeled downtown building of the former Columbus University for over two decades, until 1966, when it moved to a new building on the campus.\n\n==Buildings==\nThe chairman of the committee that handled the fund-raising for the 1914 fellowships, Edward H. Doyle,  expressed at the time of the presentation the hope that the Order would donate another $100,000 to pay for a dormitory for the 50 fellows. The University did complete its second dormitory building just in time to house them, and it became known as Graduate Hall, but it would be renamed several times{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=166}} (including University Center, then Cardinal Hall) in later years and is now known as O'Connell Hall.  In the 20th century this building housed the $50,000 check from 1904, and on its upper floors the Catholic University Council No. 9542 held its meetings and had an office.\n\nIn 1920, the Order contributed $60,000 toward the Catholic University gymnasium and drill hall, which later became the Crough Building housing the School of Architecture.{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=168}}  On October 1, 1994, the Columbus School of Law dedicated its new building on campus. The Knights of Columbus are listed among the seven donors of \"Leadership Gifts\" of $500,000 or more and a plaque in the courtyard especially honors the Knights.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>\n\nAt the 2006 [[American Cardinals Dinner]], Supreme Knight Carl Anderson announced an $8,000,000 gift to the university to renovate Keane Hall and rename it McGivney Hall, after the Knights' founder, [[Michael J. McGivney]].<ref name=\"Pike\"/><ref name=\"mcgivney\"/>  The building, which was vacant, now houses the Washington session of the  [[Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family]].<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>\n\n==Recent history==\nA $1,000,000 trust was established in August 1965 to fund the Pro Deo and Pro Patria Scholarship, providing twelve undergraduate scholarships annually to sons and daughters of Knights who earned the highest scores on a competitive examination.<ref name=\"Pro Deo\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=411}}  \n\nOn April 7, 1988 The Catholic University Council No. 9542 presented a special plaque to new Supreme Chaplain, Bishop [[Thomas V. Daily]], a member of the University's Board, in a gala event attended by the Supreme Knight and Knights from DC and the neighboring jurisdictions. The 10-foot-high check the Knights gave the University in 1904 was temporarily moved from its permanent location and set up in the Caldwell Hall where the event took place, to be seen by most present for the first time.\n\nThe North American Campus of the Pope John Paul II Institute on Marriage and the Family, funded by the Knights and established at the [[Dominican House of Studies]], adjacent to the CUA campus, opens its first academic year on September 8, 1988.<ref name=\"jpiiHistory\"/>  At the 1989 Supreme Convention in Baltimore, the Order voted a $2,000,000 birthday gift to the U.S. bishops on their bicentennial, to be given to Catholic University and used to fund special projects jointly chosen by the University and the Order.<ref name=\"Pike\"/><ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>   Proceeds from this fund helped to finance the construction of the Columbus School of Law building.<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>\n\nSupreme Knight [[Luke E. Hart]] was granted a Doctor of Laws degree in 1957, and Supreme Knight [[John W. McDevitt]] was awarded a Doctor of Humane Letters in 1967.  In 2008 Carl and Dorian  Anderson were awarded Doctor of Theology degrees.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>  Their daughter had graduated from the university several years before.

O'Connell]], then-president of CUA, has said, \"It is difficult to speak about the progress of The Catholic University of America throughout its long history without, at the same time and in the same breath, mentioning the Knights of Columbus. So much of what CUA is today is the result of the generosity and support of the Knights of Columbus.\"<ref name=\"Inside 070825\"/>  The fourth rector of the University, Monsignor [[Thomas J. Shahan]], congratulated the Order for having founded a \"Knights of Columbus College\" after a particularly large donation saved the University after a rocky financial period.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}\n\n[[Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus|Supreme Knight]] [[Carl A. Anderson]] has added that \"The [[Knights of Columbus]] enjoys a long and well-regarded relationship with [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University]].\"<ref name=\"mcgivney\"/>  Anderson formerly served on the Board of CUA's Trustees.\n\nO'Connell wrote a column for the Knights' magazine, Columbia, thanking the Knights for their assistance throughout the years on the 100th anniversary of the 1904 gift of $50,000, saying, \"I cannot imagine what The Catholic University of America would have done if it were not for the Knights of Columbus.\"\n\n==Early years==\nBoth the university and the order were founded in the 1880s, and they have been closely aligned ever since.  By 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] praised the Knights for the commitment to the faith, and singled out their contributions to the University as an example of it.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=234}}\n\n===Keane Council===\nOn June 5, 1898, Keane Council 353 was established at the university, though in later years it moved off campus.<ref name=\"Pike\"/> It was instituted with 66 charter members, and [[Lawrence O. Murray]], [[Comptroller of the Currency]], as Grand Knight. It \"formed its nucleus in the Catholic University\", in the words of Philip Garrigan, one of Keane's founders and vice-rector of the university.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}} It was named for Irish-born Bishop [[John J. Keane (bishop)|John J. Keane]], first rector of the University (1889\u20131896), and later Archbishop of Dubuque, Iowa. First meetings were in the Typographical Temple, then move to Grand Army Hall on October 12, 1898, then to the Maccabee Temple the following June.\n\n===Chair of American History===\n[[File:Knights of Columbus check presentation to The Catholic University of America.jpg|thumb|The Knights of Columbus presented a check to The Catholic University of America on the steps of the university's McMahon Hall in 1904 to establish a Chair of American History.]]\nOn March 7, 1899 Vice Rector and Knight Phillip Garrigan addressed the National Council, as the Supreme Convention was called at the time, asking for establishment of a Knights of Columbus Chair of American History at the University, to counter the somewhat anti-Catholic bias of history-writing at the time.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}} He said that \"we are attacked by anti-Catholic spokesmen on every side, partly because we have no historian among us.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=143}}  He added that while Protestant historians \"do not mean to be unfair... they cannot take Catholic facts and analyze them and give them the mainspring of the action and estimate fairly the character of the men.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=143-144}}\n\nGarrison told the assembled convention that his vision was for the historian who took the chair to be of such high stature that \"the defamer of Catholic truth will be silenced\" in his presence.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=144}}  He also mentioned to the Knights, the vast majority of whom were either born in Ireland or were of Irish descent, that the [[Ancient Order of Hibernians]] had recently donated $50,000 to establish a chair in Celtic Language and Literature.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=144}}\n\nThe convention enthusiastically accepted the proposal.  By March 5, 1901, Supreme Knight [[Edward L. Hearn]] reported unhappily to the national convention that only $10,000 has been collected  of the $50,000 commitment made two years earlier.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  It would take an additional three years to collect the total amount.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}\n\nOver 10,000 Knights were on hand on April 13, 1904 to present a $55,633.79 check ($1,399,831.80 in 2012 dollars<ref name=\"Inflation\"/>) to endow the Knights of Columbus Chair of American History to Cardinal [[James Gibbons]], Chancellor of the University and a strong supporter of the Knights.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>  The outdoor ceremony was held on the steps of the University's McMahon Hall.<ref name=\"Pike\"/> The gigantic check was ten feet high and four feet wide, and was beautifully executed on vellum in the style of an illuminated manuscript.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  It was later hang in the dining hall of the University Center West through the end of the century, and then in the newly renovated McGivney Hall after that.\n\nSupreme Knight Hearn, who viewed the Order as a sort of Catholic anti-defamation league, said at the presentation that \"non-Catholic historians... find no room in their histories to laud the magnificent work done in the early days of the nation by the Catholic missionaries and Catholic pioneers... These are the evils we seek to remedy by founding this Chair of American History.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=146}}\n\nThe check represented \"the Order's first response to a call from the American Church,\" which demonstrated to any doubters, and the early Knights did encounter opposition within the Church, that the Order was thoroughly Catholic.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}} A number of bishops were on hand for the presentation as well, which was the first time the American hierarchy gave such an ovation to the Order.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=145}}  The establishment of the Knights of Columbus Chair inaugurated the department of history of the University, but it was another five years before the new history program added other fields, with undergraduate courses in \"general history\" in 1909, and medieval history in 1914.\n\nThe first occupant of the chair was Dr. [[Charles Hallan McCarthy]].{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=227}}{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}  McCarthy, who studied at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], was teaching in a high school and was not a Knight, and thus was a controversial selection.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}  Some thought the position should go to John H. Ewing, a professor at the [[University of Notre Dame]] and the first state deputy of Indiana.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  McCarthy performed admiralty in the position however, and directed several graduate students who went on to great things, including [[Matthew J. Walsh]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=146-7}}\n\n===Scholarships===\nIn December 1904, Cardinal Gibbons appealed to the Knights for more financial aid to help meet operating costs after some investments went sour, and the Order gave nearly $25,000.<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  In his letter, he referred to the Knights' \"princely munificence\" and added that \"I know that your bounty is limited only by your means.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=147}}  \n\nBy 1907 the financial situation of Catholic University had improved but was still shaky.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=147-8}}   Archbishop [[John J. Glennon]] of St. Louis, chairman of a committee to plan for a $500,000 endowment, appealed to the Knights as the committee believed the Order was the only organization which could raise such a large sum.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  On August 8th he addressed the national convention in Norfolk, urging the Order to \"fuse the activities of your Society into one grand movement that would stand out at the head of all Catholic National and Charitable movements in the United States.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  He added that doing so would \"give you the position your friends believe you are entitled to, namely the leading Catholic Society of the leading Catholic people of the United States.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}\n\nHearn did not endorse the proposal, and by at least one account seemed cool to the idea, but left it to the \"serious and careful thoughts of the delegates.\"{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}  The National Council accepted the idea in principal, although several proposals to raise the funds could not find enough support to pass.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=149}}  Eventually, Hearn was instructed to appoint a committee to settle the matter.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=148}}\n\nAfter some delay, a committee was assembled in January 1908 and finally in December devised a plan that won the support of the Board of Directors in April 1909.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=150-151}}  Every Knight was mailed a letter and was asked to voluntarily contribute $1 a year for a five-year period.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}  On December 6, 1913 the goal was realized.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}\n\nAt Cardinal Gibbons's residence in Baltimore on January 6, 1914, a party headed by new Supreme Knight [[James A. Flaherty]] presented $500,000 in securities, the results of the fund drive for Catholic University.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/> The University and the Order agreed that rather than an endowment as originally planned, the funds would be used to establish fellowships for M.A. or Ph.D. studies with the hope of producing teachers for both Catholic and secular colleges and universities.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}  Originally there was to be one fellowship for every $10,000, with preference going to Knights or their families.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}} \n\nBy 1922, 146 K. of C. Fellowships had been awarded.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=152}}  In later years the funds permitted far fewer fellowships, which, in the words of the University's centennial history in 1990 \"have remained the most attractive fellowships under the control of the university despite drastic reductions in their number due to the effects of inflation upon university charges for tuition, board, and room.\"<ref name=\"Nuesse1990\"/>\n\nThe fellowships established by the Order, and the active interest shown by some members of the faculty in the Knights, made the University a good place to look for members. In February 1925, Washington Council arranged for a smoker at the University for faculty and students.  As a result, a Knights of Columbus Club was organized which in turn resulted in the initiation of about fifty students into the Council annually during the next few years. Some became officers.\n\n===Sun Bowl===\nAfter the [[1940 Sun Bowl]], Knights of Columbus in El Paso took the Cardinal football players over the border for lunch<ref name=Baugh/> in the \"squalid but colorful Mexican town\" of [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]].<ref name=squalid/>\n\n==Columbus School of Law==\nWith the success of its vocational courses in camps to prepare World War I veterans for civilian life, the Supreme Council established an Education Committee in June 1919.  This Committee later established a national tuition-free evening school program for veterans. By November, when the War Department took over the camp vocational courses from volunteer agencies, the Knights had nearly seven thousand students in twenty-five camps.  Washington Council Grand Knight Frank O'Hara, head of the economics department at the University, taught with other Knights teach in the Washington program, which focused on high school subjects. He later become dean of the school, and liberal arts and professional courses were added.{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=226}} \n \nIn 1921 Catholic University \"affiliated\" with the Knights of Columbus evening school for its college courses, and three years later also recognized its secondary school courses.  This allowed \"a large group of Catholic students who otherwise would go elsewhere to continue their studies\" to instead attend CUA, as the annual report of the rector stated. The school was located at St. John's College on Vermont Avenue, with 1,500 students registered, and a faculty of 24, of whom twenty were from the CUA. A committee of University trustees saw it as \"practically under University control, though not officially so.\"\n\nThe evening school had developed into Columbus University and obtained a charter in 1922. It was reported that the Order's Board of Directors was disassociating itself from the institution. Though there was appreciation among ecclesiastical officials of the service provided to those who couldn't regularly attend a university, there was also concern in the Catholic University administration about the confusion that could result from the close relationship between CUA and Columbus University. During this time there was a lessening of the role of the CUA teachers. O'Hara resigned as president of Columbus University and from its board, though he continued to teach, and there was a reduction of the course offerings to accounting and law. Sometime in the years 1923-25, the five councils of Washington D.C. voted on whether to keep the school open, with three favoring and two against.\n\nThree decades later, in 1954, Columbus University would merge with the law program of CUA to become The [[Columbus School of Law]] at The Catholic University of America<ref name=\"Pike\"/>  after the [[American Bar Association]] in 1951 challenged law schools not affiliated with a university. The CUA law school was the first professional school of the University, and occupied the remodeled downtown building of the former Columbus University for over two decades, until 1966, when it moved to a new building on the campus.\n\n==Buildings==\nThe chairman of the committee that handled the fund-raising for the 1914 fellowships, Edward H. Doyle,  expressed at the time of the presentation the hope that the Order would donate another $100,000 to pay for a dormitory for the 50 fellows. The University did complete its second dormitory building just in time to house them, and it became known as Graduate Hall, but it would be renamed several times{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=166}} (including University Center, then Cardinal Hall) in later years and is now known as O'Connell Hall.  In the 20th century this building housed the $50,000 check from 1904, and on its upper floors the Catholic University Council No. 9542 held its meetings and had an office.\n\nIn 1920, the Order contributed $60,000 toward the Catholic University gymnasium and drill hall, which later became the Crough Building housing the School of Architecture.{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=168}}  On October 1, 1994, the Columbus School of Law dedicated its new building on campus. The Knights of Columbus are listed among the seven donors of \"Leadership Gifts\" of $500,000 or more and a plaque in the courtyard especially honors the Knights.<ref name=\"Pike\"/>\n\nAt the 2006 [[American Cardinals Dinner]], Supreme Knight Carl Anderson announced an $8,000,000 gift to the university to renovate Keane Hall and rename it McGivney Hall, after the Knights' founder, [[Michael J. McGivney]].<ref name=\"Pike\"/><ref name=\"mcgivney\"/>  The building, which was vacant, now houses the Washington session of the  [[Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family]].<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>\n\n==Recent history==\nA $1,000,000 trust was established in August 1965 to fund the Pro Deo and Pro Patria Scholarship, providing twelve undergraduate scholarships annually to sons and daughters of Knights who earned the highest scores on a competitive examination.<ref name=\"Pro Deo\"/>{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=411}}  \n\nOn April 7, 1988 The Catholic University Council No. 9542 presented a special plaque to new Supreme Chaplain, Bishop [[Thomas V. Daily]], a member of the University's Board, in a gala event attended by the Supreme Knight and Knights from DC and the neighboring jurisdictions. The 10-foot-high check the Knights gave the University in 1904 was temporarily moved from its permanent location and set up in the Caldwell Hall where the event took place, to be seen by most present for the first time.\n\nThe North American Campus of the Pope John Paul II Institute on Marriage and the Family, funded by the Knights and established at the [[Dominican House of Studies]], adjacent to the CUA campus, opens its first academic year on September 8, 1988.<ref name=\"jpiiHistory\"/>  At the 1989 Supreme Convention in Baltimore, the Order voted a $2,000,000 birthday gift to the U.S. bishops on their bicentennial, to be given to Catholic University and used to fund special projects jointly chosen by the University and the Order.<ref name=\"Pike\"/><ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>   Proceeds from this fund helped to finance the construction of the Columbus School of Law building.<ref name=\"Catholic DC\"/>\n\nSupreme Knight [[Luke E.

It was founded in 1947 following the unification of four local clubs. Home matches take place at [[Bonchuk Stadium]], where Marek famously defeated [[Bayern Munich]] in 1977. Bonchuk stadium has a capacity of 16,000. The team last played top-flight football during the 2014\u201315 season, after which it has played in the third tier. Marek's greatest achievement is winning the 1978 [[Bulgarian Cup]].<ref>[https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/season=1977/matches/round=1086/match=65052/index.html UEFA Europa League History \u2013 Marek-Bayern 1977/78] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 17 September 2018.</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n'''[[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]]:'''\n* [[Image:Bronze medal icon.svg|15px]] Third place (2): [[1948 Bulgarian Republic Football Championship|1948]], [[1976\u201377 A PFG|1977]]\n\n'''[[Second Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Second League]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[2013\u201314 B PFG|2014]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (1):''' [[1977\u201378 Bulgarian Cup|1978]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1919\u20131947)===\nThe people of [[Dupnitsa]] watched football being played for the first time by foreign troops stationed in the city during [[World War I]]. Over the next several years, four clubs were founded in the city: Slavia, Levski, ZHSK, and Athletic. In 1923, these clubs participated in the formation of the Southwest Football League and, between 1935 and 1944, they frequently took part in the finals of the national tournaments. By 1944, each of the four had their own stadium.\n\n===Marek (1947\u20131970)===\n[[Image:Marekold1.png|thumb|100px|right|1947\u20131970]]\nIn 1947, Slavia, Levski, ZHSK, and Athletic decided to merge into one club, which was named Marek, after the [[nickname]] of [[Stanke Dimitrov]], a local hero of the [[Communist]] party. Marek is an abbreviation for [[Marxist]], [[Antifascist]], [[Revolutionary]], [[Emigrant]], [[Communist]].\n\nIn 1948, Marek became a part of the newly created first division, the [[Bulgarian A PFG]], finishing eighth out of ten clubs in season [[A PFG 1948\u201349|1948\u201349]]. The club was relegated to 2nd division, [[B PFG]], in 1950. Marek subsequently won promotions to the [[Bulgarian A PFG]] in 1952 and 1956, followed by immediate relegation to [[B PFG]] the following seasons, 1953 and 1957, respectively. During these years, Marek's greatest achievement was 5th place in the [[Bulgarian A PFG]] during the 1960\u201361 season. The team's coach at that time was Lyuben Petrov. Up until the mid-1970s, Marek bounced back and forth between the first and second divisions of Bulgarian football.\n\n===Success in Bulgaria and Europe (1975\u20131981)===\n[[File:Marek-dupnitsa20.png|thumbnail|300px|Marek vs. Bayern in 1977]]\nThe most notable successes for Marek came in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the club finished third in the league in 1977 and won the [[Bulgarian Cup|cup]] in 1978, defeating overwhelming favorites [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] 1:0 in front of 75,000 spectators at [[Vasil Levski Stadium]] in [[Sofia]].\n\nDuring the 1976\u201377 season, Marek defeated [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA]] twice, home and away, with the scores 2:1 and 3:1. That season, the club led the league for several rounds and at the end the team fought tooth and nail with [[Slavia Sofia]] for the third place in the table. Marek won the decisive game against Slavia in Dupnitsa by the score of 1:0, finishing 3rd and earning an entry into the [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup]]. This is Marek's best finish to date in the top flight of Bulgarian football.\n\nIn this period the team also played in [[Europe]]: [[UEFA Cup]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]]. Victories include games  against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern]] (a 2\u20130 victory), against [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] of [[Hungary]] (a 3\u20130 victory), and against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] of [[Scotland]] (a 3\u20132 victory), then led by coach [[Alex Ferguson]]. The return leg in Scotland was tied 0\u20130 until late in the game, when substitute [[Gordon Strachan]] scored a goal and led his team to a 3\u20130 victory.<ref>[https://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=70090/profile/history/index.html UEFA History \u2013 Marek] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 17 September 2018.</ref>\n\nThe club also competed in the 1980 Intertoto Cup against [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]] (2\u20133, 1\u20134) \u2013 a team that won the UEFA Cup just a year later;[[Boldklubben 1893|B 93 Copenhagen]] (2\u20130, 2\u20133), and [[SV Austria Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]] (4\u20132, 2\u20132) to finish second in the group. The following season Marek once again competed in the Intertoto Cup-against [[Stuttgarter Kickers]] (0\u20131, 0\u20132), [[Viking F.K.|Viking]] (1\u20132, 0\u20133), and [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] (0\u20131, 1\u20134) and finished last in its group.\n\n'''Stadium and fans:'''\nThe team is known for its loyal supporters and the local stadium \"[[Bonchuk Stadium]]\" is infamous for being a difficult place for visiting teams. \"[[Bonchuk Stadium]]\" holds 16,050 people. The town of [[Dupnitsa]] was known as the \"city on wheels\", because thousands of loyal Marek fans would follow the team at away games to remote parts of [[Bulgaria]].\n\n'''Famous players:'''\nAmong the most famous players of Marek are Kiril Milanov, Dimitar Isakov, Nikolay \"Shultz\" Krastev, Sasho Pargov, Ivan and Ventzi Petrov, Stoyan Stoyanov (a goalkeeper), Asen Tomov, and Dimitre Dimitrov-Miki. The [[Coach (sport)|coach]] associated with the successes of Marek is Yanko Dinkov.\n\n===Recent history (2001\u20132010)===\n[[Image:Marekold2.png|thumb|105px|right|1998\u20132004]]\nIn 1983, Marek was relegated to [[B PFG]] and then the third division of Bulgarian football. After over a decade of playing in the lower divisions, in 2001 Marek returned triumphantly to the [[Bulgarian A PFG]].\n\nAs a participant in the Intertoto Cup, Marek tied 1\u20131 the German Bundesliga club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2003, but lost away from home the second leg, 0\u20132, and was eliminated from the tournament. The team finished 7th at the conclusion of the 2003\u201304 season, 9th at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, 11th after the 2005\u201306 season, and 12th at the end of the 2006\u201307 football season of the Bulgarian premier division, [[Bulgarian A PFG]] (out of 16 teams). In 2006\u201307, Marek secured its place in the Bulgarian top division for the next season with a 1\u20130 home win over the powerhouse [[CSKA Sofia]].\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, Marek was plagued by injuries of key players, several coaching changes and a not-so-well covered conflict between the senior players of the club: Angelo and [[Yanek Kyuchukov]] and the club president, Yordan Andreev. Further, the team sold their best and most talented player, [[Enyo Krastovchev]], to Levski Sofia.\nAs a result, the team finished in last place, 16th, with only 5 wins in 30 games, in the [[Bulgarian A PFG]], and was relegated to [[B PFG]] for the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nBefore the start of the 2008\u201309 season in [[B PFG]], the team held its pre-season training in France in an attempt by the club President Andreev to compile a team made up exclusively of young foreign players. The team even had a Portuguese coach for the first few games of the season. The regular season started disastrously for Marek. After several consecutive losses, the Portuguese coach was fired, and all but one of the foreign players left the club.\n\nMarek barely survived the 2008\u201309 season in [[B PFG]], finishing 14th out of 16 teams, winning only 7 out of 30 regular season games, scoring 29 and conceding 48 goals.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season in [[B PFG]], the team was coached by Velin Kostadinov and player-manager Angelo Kyuchukov. The team found more consistency and finished comfortably in 10th place with 41 points.\n\n===A New Beginning (2010\u2013)===\nThe Bulgarian Football Federation denied Marek the license to compete in [[B PFG]] for the 2010\u201311 season due to the team's financial debts. Thus, the club had to start over and compete at the lowest level of Bulgarian football, in the regional amateur league, Zona Rila. The team's new coach became [[Ivaylo Pargov]], a former player for the team.\n\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, Marek dominated the local amateur division and after winning all but one of its regular season games, it earned a playoff game against [[PFC Belasitsa Petrich]] for the right to play in the third division, [[Bulgarian V AFG]]. The play-off game was tied after 90 minutes, 1\u20131, and Belasitsa went on to win on penalties.\n\nDespite the lost playoff and the prospect of spending a second season in the regional amateur league, a number of third division teams declined participation prior to the upcoming 2011\u201312 season due to financial insolvency. Thus, Marek was administratively promoted to the third division, [[Bulgarian V AFG]] for the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Marek finished first in the Southwest V AFG and earned automatic promotion to the Bulgarian Second Division. [[B PFG]]\n\nMarek surprised its numerous fans with a fantastic 2013\u201314 season in the Second Division, dominating its opponents and securing promotion to [[A PFG]] with four games to go.\n\nThe return to [[A PFG]] has proven difficult as Marek finished the 2014\u20132015 season in 11th place out of 12 teams, and the team was relegated. Marek won only six games the entire season, vs. Haskovo three times, at Cherno More and vs. Slavia Sofia.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014\u20132015 season Marek did not receive a professional license from the Bulgarian Football Federation due to unpaid financial obligations to government institutions, and the team was relegated to the amateur divisions.\n\nSubsequently, Marek was fined by the Bulgarian Football Federation due to \"suspicion\" of match fixing and the club ownership decided to dissolve the existing club and register a new FC Marek 1915, which started competing from the lowest level of football in Bulgaria \u2013 4th division \u2013 during the 2015\u20132016 season.\n\nFollowing an undefeated season, and navigating through two rounds of playoffs, Marek earned a promotion to 3rd division for season [[2016\u201317 Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|2016\u201317]].\n\n==Marek in Europe==\n\n===UEFA cup===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

football|football]] club based in [[Dupnitsa]], currently playing in the [[Third League (Bulgaria)|Third League]]. It was founded in 1947 following the unification of four local clubs. Home matches take place at [[Bonchuk Stadium]], where Marek famously defeated [[Bayern Munich]] in 1977. Bonchuk stadium has a capacity of 16,000. The team last played top-flight football during the 2014\u201315 season, after which it has played in the third tier. Marek's greatest achievement is winning the 1978 [[Bulgarian Cup]].<ref>[https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/history/season=1977/matches/round=1086/match=65052/index.html UEFA Europa League History \u2013 Marek-Bayern 1977/78] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 17 September 2018.</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n\n===Domestic===\n* '''[[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|First League]]:'''\n: Third place (2): [[1948 Bulgarian Republic Football Championship|1948]], [[1976\u201377 A PFG|1977]]\n\n* '''[[Second Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Second League]]:'''\n: '''Winners:''' [[2013\u201314 B PFG|2014]]\n\n* '''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n: '''Winners:''' [[1977\u201378 Bulgarian Cup|1978]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history (1919\u20131947)===\nThe people of [[Dupnitsa]] watched football being played for the first time by foreign troops stationed in the city during [[World War I]]. Over the next several years, four clubs were founded in the city: Slavia, Levski, ZHSK, and Athletic. In 1923, these clubs participated in the formation of the Southwest Football League and, between 1935 and 1944, they frequently took part in the finals of the national tournaments. By 1944, each of the four had their own stadium.\n\n===Marek (1947\u20131970)===\n[[Image:Marekold1.png|thumb|100px|right|1947\u20131970]]\nIn 1947, Slavia, Levski, ZHSK, and Athletic decided to merge into one club, which was named Marek, after the [[nickname]] of [[Stanke Dimitrov]], a local hero of the [[Communist]] party. Marek is an abbreviation for [[Marxist]], [[Antifascist]], [[Revolutionary]], [[Emigrant]], [[Communist]].\n\nIn 1948, Marek became a part of the newly created first division, the [[Bulgarian A PFG]], finishing eighth out of ten clubs in season [[A PFG 1948\u201349|1948\u201349]]. The club was relegated to 2nd division, [[B PFG]], in 1950. Marek subsequently won promotions to the [[Bulgarian A PFG]] in 1952 and 1956, followed by immediate relegation to [[B PFG]] the following seasons, 1953 and 1957, respectively. During these years, Marek's greatest achievement was 5th place in the [[Bulgarian A PFG]] during the 1960\u201361 season. The team's coach at that time was Lyuben Petrov. Up until the mid-1970s, Marek bounced back and forth between the first and second divisions of Bulgarian football.\n\n===Success in Bulgaria and Europe (1975\u20131981)===\n[[File:Marek-dupnitsa20.png|thumbnail|300px|Marek vs. Bayern in 1977]]\nThe most notable successes for Marek came in the late 1970s and early 1980s when the club finished third in the league in 1977 and won the [[Bulgarian Cup|cup]] in 1978, defeating overwhelming favorites [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] 1:0 in front of 75,000 spectators at [[Vasil Levski Stadium]] in [[Sofia]].\n\nDuring the 1976\u201377 season, Marek defeated [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA]] twice, home and away, with the scores 2:1 and 3:1. That season, the club led the league for several rounds and at the end the team fought tooth and nail with [[Slavia Sofia]] for the third place in the table. Marek won the decisive game against Slavia in Dupnitsa by the score of 1:0, finishing 3rd and earning an entry into the [[1977\u201378 UEFA Cup]]. This is Marek's best finish to date in the top flight of Bulgarian football.\n\nIn this period the team also played in [[Europe]]: [[UEFA Cup]], [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], and [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]]. Victories include games  against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern]] (a 2\u20130 victory), against [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] of [[Hungary]] (a 3\u20130 victory), and against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] of [[Scotland]] (a 3\u20132 victory), then led by coach [[Alex Ferguson]]. The return leg in Scotland was tied 0\u20130 until late in the game, when substitute [[Gordon Strachan]] scored a goal and led his team to a 3\u20130 victory.<ref>[https://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/club=70090/profile/history/index.html UEFA History \u2013 Marek] ''UEFA.com'' Retrieved 17 September 2018.</ref>\n\nThe club also competed in the 1980 Intertoto Cup against [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]] (2\u20133, 1\u20134) \u2013 a team that won the UEFA Cup just a year later;[[Boldklubben 1893|B 93 Copenhagen]] (2\u20130, 2\u20133), and [[SV Austria Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]] (4\u20132, 2\u20132) to finish second in the group. The following season Marek once again competed in the Intertoto Cup-against [[Stuttgarter Kickers]] (0\u20131, 0\u20132), [[Viking F.K.|Viking]] (1\u20132, 0\u20133), and [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] (0\u20131, 1\u20134) and finished last in its group.\n\n'''Stadium and fans:'''\nThe team is known for its loyal supporters and the local stadium \"[[Bonchuk Stadium]]\" is infamous for being a difficult place for visiting teams. \"[[Bonchuk Stadium]]\" holds 16,050 people. The town of [[Dupnitsa]] was known as the \"city on wheels\", because thousands of loyal Marek fans would follow the team at away games to remote parts of [[Bulgaria]].\n\n'''Famous players:'''\nAmong the most famous players of Marek are Kiril Milanov, Dimitar Isakov, Nikolay \"Shultz\" Krastev, Sasho Pargov, Ivan and Ventzi Petrov, Stoyan Stoyanov (a goalkeeper), Asen Tomov, and Dimitre Dimitrov-Miki. The [[Coach (sport)|coach]] associated with the successes of Marek is Yanko Dinkov.\n\n===Recent history (2001\u20132010)===\n[[Image:Marekold2.png|thumb|105px|right|1998\u20132004]]\nIn 1983, Marek was relegated to [[B PFG]] and then the third division of Bulgarian football. After over a decade of playing in the lower divisions, in 2001 Marek returned triumphantly to the [[Bulgarian A PFG]].\n\nAs a participant in the Intertoto Cup, Marek tied 1\u20131 the German Bundesliga club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2003, but lost away from home the second leg, 0\u20132, and was eliminated from the tournament. The team finished 7th at the conclusion of the 2003\u201304 season, 9th at the end of the 2004\u201305 season, 11th after the 2005\u201306 season, and 12th at the end of the 2006\u201307 football season of the Bulgarian premier division, [[Bulgarian A PFG]] (out of 16 teams). In 2006\u201307, Marek secured its place in the Bulgarian top division for the next season with a 1\u20130 home win over the powerhouse [[CSKA Sofia]].\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, Marek was plagued by injuries of key players, several coaching changes and a not-so-well covered conflict between the senior players of the club: Angelo and [[Yanek Kyuchukov]] and the club president, Yordan Andreev. Further, the team sold their best and most talented player, [[Enyo Krastovchev]], to Levski Sofia.\nAs a result, the team finished in last place, 16th, with only 5 wins in 30 games, in the [[Bulgarian A PFG]], and was relegated to [[B PFG]] for the 2008\u201309 season.\n\nBefore the start of the 2008\u201309 season in [[B PFG]], the team held its pre-season training in France in an attempt by the club President Andreev to compile a team made up exclusively of young foreign players. The team even had a Portuguese coach for the first few games of the season. The regular season started disastrously for Marek. After several consecutive losses, the Portuguese coach was fired, and all but one of the foreign players left the club.\n\nMarek barely survived the 2008\u201309 season in [[B PFG]], finishing 14th out of 16 teams, winning only 7 out of 30 regular season games, scoring 29 and conceding 48 goals.\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season in [[B PFG]], the team was coached by Velin Kostadinov and player-manager Angelo Kyuchukov. The team found more consistency and finished comfortably in 10th place with 41 points.\n\n===A New Beginning (2010\u2013)===\nThe Bulgarian Football Federation denied Marek the license to compete in [[B PFG]] for the 2010\u201311 season due to the team's financial debts. Thus, the club had to start over and compete at the lowest level of Bulgarian football, in the regional amateur league, Zona Rila. The team's new coach became [[Ivaylo Pargov]], a former player for the team.\n\nDuring the 2010\u201311 season, Marek dominated the local amateur division and after winning all but one of its regular season games, it earned a playoff game against [[PFC Belasitsa Petrich]] for the right to play in the third division, [[Bulgarian V AFG]]. The play-off game was tied after 90 minutes, 1\u20131, and Belasitsa went on to win on penalties.\n\nDespite the lost playoff and the prospect of spending a second season in the regional amateur league, a number of third division teams declined participation prior to the upcoming 2011\u201312 season due to financial insolvency. Thus, Marek was administratively promoted to the third division, [[Bulgarian V AFG]] for the 2011\u201312 season.\n\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Marek finished first in the Southwest V AFG and earned automatic promotion to the Bulgarian Second Division. [[B PFG]]\n\nMarek surprised its numerous fans with a fantastic 2013\u201314 season in the Second Division, dominating its opponents and securing promotion to [[A PFG]] with four games to go.\n\nThe return to [[A PFG]] has proven difficult as Marek finished the 2014\u20132015 season in 11th place out of 12 teams, and the team was relegated. Marek won only six games the entire season, vs. Haskovo three times, at Cherno More and vs. Slavia Sofia.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the 2014\u20132015 season Marek did not receive a professional license from the Bulgarian Football Federation due to unpaid financial obligations to government institutions, and the team was relegated to the amateur divisions.\n\nSubsequently, Marek was fined by the Bulgarian Football Federation due to \"suspicion\" of match fixing and the club ownership decided to dissolve the existing club and register a new FC Marek 1915, which started competing from the lowest level of football in Bulgaria \u2013 4th division \u2013 during the 2015\u20132016 season.\n\nFollowing an undefeated season, and navigating through two rounds of playoffs, Marek earned a promotion to 3rd division for season [[2016\u201317 Third Amateur Football League (Bulgaria)|2016\u201317]].\n\n==Marek in Europe==\n\n===UEFA cup===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
