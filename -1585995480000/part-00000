He has loved many women, and has been loved back by many of them. Several of these ladies have left the domestic security provided by their husbands in order to further pursue a relationship with Gresham, despite Gresham's own advise to the contrary. As his lovers compete over him, Gresham uses his love life as inspiration for a series of cynical novels.<ref>{{cite web|author=A.D.S. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9400E2D81430E033A25750C2A9609C946594D6CF |title=Movie Review - Affairs of A Gentleman - Murder of a Novelist. |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=1934-06-23 |accessdate=2016-01-11}}</ref> Each of his novels described the events of one of his love affairs.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nEarly in the film, Gresham is found dead at his own writing desk.

There is a note with Gresham's signature nearby, which suggests that the novelist committed suicide. However, Inspector Quillan, who investigates the death, suspects murder to be more likely. Gresham's former lovers are now suspects and six of these women are found to have been present at Gresham's apartment, the night before his death.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nThe circumstances of their presence are soon explained. One of the women, Carlotta Barbe, had organized a surprise party for Gresham. She invited the [[Muse]]s of Gresham's novels to attend. Gail Melville attended the party to officially end her relationship with Gresham, before marrying her fianc\u00e9. Gladys Durland had been Gresham's lover for two years, and attended the party to explain her plans to finally leave her husband. Foxey Dennison is also married, but still wanted to have an affair with Gresham. Nan Fitzerald was the inspiration for Gresham's first novel and wanted to see him again.<ref name=\"afi\"/> The sixth woman at the party, Jean Sinclair, was apparently never Gresham's lover. Sinclair is a female illustrator, and her relationship with him was professional. She hoped to illustrate ''Frailty'', once the novel was finished. She arrived at the party with Carter Vaughan, her boyfriend.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nThe events following the party are depicted in flashback. All the guests leave for the night, except for Fitzerald who is drunk and sleeping. She spends the night at the couch of Gresham's apartment. The following morning, Gresham has yet to decide on an ending for his novel. He discusses the matter with Fletcher, his [[valet]], and asks Fletcher to think of an ending.<ref name=\"afi\"/> Fitzgerald wakes with a hangover and Gresham instructs her to get some proper sleep in his apartment. He soon discovers that there is a handgun hidden in her purse. Meanwhile, the morning newspaper reports the death of actress Peggy Fanning. Fanning was Gresham's latest lover and the inspiration for ''Frailty''. She had divorced her husband, a fellow actor, in hopes of marrying Gresham. However, Gresham rejected her and had no interest in marrying her. The newspaper reports that Fanning committed [[suicide]] in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nThe flashback continues. Durland visits Gresham to warn him of danger. Her husband has read Gresham's novel about her and recognized his wife in it, due to a \"detailed description of her sexual idiosyncrasies\". Her husband wants to kill Gresham, and Durland tries to convince Gresham to flee with her to escape his wrath. Gresham rejects her offer and her love. He is no longer interested in her. Gresham is next visited by Barbe, who tries to renew her love affair with him. He rejects her and throws her out of his apartment. The next arrival is Sinclair, eager to show her sketches to Fletcher and get an agreement about the illustration of ''Frailty''. Gresham hires her for the illustration of the novel, though he has another motive for the act. He has fallen in love with Sinclair and hopes to pursue a relationship with her.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nLyn Durland, Gladys' husband, arrives and threatens to kill Gresham. Sinclair manages to convince the furious Lyn that Gresham is her own lover, and that they are going to marry. Lyn leaves, and the supposed couple embraces. There is a genuine attraction, but Sinclair does not trust Gresham. She flees the apartment, unwilling to become the topic of his next novel. Fitzgerald witnesses the scene and realizes that Gresham has fallen in love with another woman. She decides to leave him, and leave the United States for good. Gresham does not protest, but offers to purchase her handgun first. He is now the owner of the weapon.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\nTrying to finish the novel, Gresham has the idea to end it with a suicide. He discusses the matter with Fletcher, and the conversation turns into the matter of suicide in general. Fletcher informs his employer about Fanning's suicide in Paris, and accuses Gresham of having killed the woman. Fletcher then has a confession for Gresham. He is not a valet, but an actor. \"Fletcher\" is the husband which Fanning cheated on and deserted. He entered Gresham's service in order to get close to him and plot his revenge. Following his confession, \"Fletcher\" kills Gresham. Gresham finally has an ending for his novel. But he is dead and can not write it down.<ref name=\"afi\"/>\n\n==Cast== \n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Paul Lukas]] as Victor Gresham\n*[[Leila Hyams]] as Gladys Durland\n*[[Patricia Ellis]] as Jean Sinclair\n*[[Phillip Reed]] as Carter Vaughn\n*[[Onslow Stevens]] as Lyn Durland\n*[[Dorothy Burgess]] as Nan Fitzgerald\n*[[Lilian Bond]] as Carlotta Barbe\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n*[[Joyce Compton]] as Foxey Dennison\n*[[Murray Kinnell]] as Fletcher\n*Dorothy Libaire as Gail Melville\n*[[Richard Carle]] as Paul Q.

The ''Alsace'' design was based on variants of the {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}, and three proposals were submitted by the design staff. The proposed armament included nine or twelve {{cvt|380|mm}} guns or nine {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns, but no choice was definitively made before the program ended in mid-1940. According to one pair of historians, logistical considerations\u2014including the size of the 12-gun variant and the introduction of a new shell [[caliber]] for the 406&nbsp;mm version\u2014led the naval command to settle on the nine 380&nbsp;mm design. But another pair of authors disagree, believing that the difficulty of designing and manufacturing a three-[[gun turret]] would have caused prohibitive delays during wartime, making the third, largest variant the most likely to have been built. The ships would have forced the French government to make significant improvements to its harbor and shipyard facilities, as the smaller ''Richelieu''s already stretched the limitations of existing shipyards. With construction of the first member of the class scheduled for 1941, the plan was terminated by the German victory in the [[Battle of France]] in May\u2013June 1940.\n\n== Background and development==\n[[File:French battleship Richelieu colorized.jpg|thumb|left|{{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}}, the previous French battleship design]]\n\nFrance, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] in 1936, though Japan and Italy both refused to do so, which effectively ended the international naval arms control regime begun with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922. The treaty was to have reduced the [[caliber]] of new [[battleship]]s' [[main battery|main batteries]] from {{cvt|406|mm|0}} to {{cvt|356|mm|0}} while retaining the original [[displacement (ship)|displacement]] limit of {{cvt|35000|LT|t|lk=on}}, but the [[US Navy]] insisted on an \"escalator clause\" that allowed a reversion to 406&nbsp;mm guns if any signatory to the original naval treaties refused to sign the Second London agreement. After Japan withdrew from the conference on 15 January 1937 and refused to return, the United States invoked the clause on 31 March. A year later, the French, American, and British naval commands exchanged notes that resulted in a joint agreement on 30 June 1938 permitting construction of battleships with a displacement of up to {{cvt|45000|LT|t}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=176\u2013177}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=80}}\n\nThe French naval command initially intended to remain within the original displacement limits, since existing naval infrastructure prohibited vessels larger than the {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}, and even for those 35,000-ton ships, inventive measures had to be taken to build the first two vessels. The work to improve French shipyards and harbor facilities would have significantly increased the cost of building battleships up to the treaty maximum. The command assumed that only Japan and the United State would be interested in building 45,000-ton ships and so announced that it would respect the 35,000-ton limit so long as other European navies did the same. French plans were disrupted in mid-1939 when French [[military intelligence]] became aware that the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (War Navy) had begun construction of two [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleships]] in accordance with [[Plan Z]]; these were {{cvt|56000|LT|t|adj=on}} ships, though French intelligence initially believed them to be only {{cvt|40000|LT|t|adj=on}} vessels. This development led ''Vice-Amiral'' (Vice Admiral) [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], to order design studies for new battleships that exceeded the 35,000-ton limit. Darlan specified that the armament was to be {{cvt|400|mm|1}}, 406&nbsp;mm, or {{cvt|420|mm|1}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=177}}{{sfn|Breyer|pp=305\u2013309}}\n\n==Infrastructure concerns==\nIn the late 1930s, there were only three existing [[slipway]]s capable of building large ships: The No. 4 dock at [[Brest, France|Brest]] and the ''Forme Caquot'' and No. 1 docks in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. The No. 4 dock was only {{cvt|250|m}}, too short to build any vessel larger than the ''Richelieu''s (which themselves had to be built without their bow or stern and completed after launching), and the No. 1 dock in Saint-Nazaire was already occupied with building the [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Joffre||2}} (and was slated to begin construction of her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Painlev\u00e9||2}} after the latter's projected launch in 1941).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=179}}\n\nTo build battleships to compete with the German H-class vessels, the French Navy would need to embark on a major program to improve its infrastructure. The Laninon Docks at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] were to be significantly expanded; a new, longer dock (that would be designated Dock No. 10) that was {{cvt|275|m}} long and {{cvt|58|m}} wide was to be excavated, which would have been large enough to construct the ''Alsace'' class. A new {{cvt|360|m}} long [[graving dock]] was to be built, and the existing Dock No. 9 was to be lengthened from 250&nbsp;m to {{cvt|300|m}}. Dock No. 10 was slated to be completed by 1942, at which point work on the graving dock would begin, as budgetary limitations and a shortage of skilled workers prevented both facilities from being built at the same time. At a later date, Dock No. 10 was to be lengthened to 360&nbsp;m as well.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=178}}\n\nIn addition to shipbuilding facilities, the new battleships would necessitate improved repair and harbor facilities at the various major naval bases. Port facilities had already been built or were in the process of construction at [[Cherbourg]], [[Toulon]], [[Casablanca]], [[Bizerta]], and [[Dakar]], though dry-docks in those ports were not sufficient to handle even a ''Richelieu'' in a damaged condition (where flooding would increase [[draft (hull)|draft]] of more than {{cvt|11|m}}). It was estimated that these docks would need to be dredged to at least {{cvt|12|m}} to accommodate the ''Alsace'' design. The navy had to acquire other equipment, including the [[tugboat]]s necessary to maneuver the ships in port and [[floating crane]]s needed to [[fitting-out|fit out]] the vessels, but shortages in machinery slowed construction and owing to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, France was unable to order the vessels from neutral countries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=178}}\n\n== Design proposals ==\nDesign work began in late 1939; three versions were prepared, all of which were developments of the Project C type that was created during the design process for the [[Richelieu-class_battleship#Clemenceau_and_Gascogne_variants|''Clemenceau'' and ''Gascogne'' variants]] of the ''Richelieu'' class. Unlike the standard ''Richelieu'' type that mounted all eight of their main battery guns in a pair of four-[[gun turret]]s forward, the Project C design adopted an arrangement with two three-gun turrets forward and one triple turret aft. The design staff considered three [[standard displacement]]s; {{cvt|40000|LT|t}}, {{cvt|42500|LT|t}}, and {{cvt|45000|LT|t}}. The first was the same figure proposed for the British {{sclass-|Lion|battleship|1}}s and that incorrectly assumed for the German H-class ships, the third was the maximum under the agreement reached with Britain and the United States, and the third was a compromise displacement figured to be the minimum that could accommodate the mandated top speed of at least {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}} along with a battery of 406&nbsp;mm guns.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=179\u2013180}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=145}} \n\nThe first proposal for ''Alsace'', No. 1, was essentially a slightly enlarged version of Project C. The ship had a longer hull, which required a {{convert|15000|shp|lk=on}} increase in [[horsepower]] while incurring a loss of one knot in top speed. No. 2 was a scaled up version of No. 1, with the 380&nbsp;mm guns replaced with 406&nbsp;mm guns. The even larger hull necessitated a further increase in horsepower by {{cvt|20000|shp}} to maintain the same speed. The No. 3 type was enlarged further to accommodate three quadruple 380&nbsp;mm turrets, though it managed to increase speed by a knot. All of the designs would have carried a light anti-aircraft battery of {{cvt|37|mm}} and {{cvt|25|mm}} guns, but the numbers and arrangements of those guns had not been finalized before the program came to an end.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|+Characteristics{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=177}}\n!rowspan = 2 |Design\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Length overall]]\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Beam (nautical)|Beam]]\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Standard displacement]]\n!rowspan = 2 |Normal displacement\n!rowspan = 2 |Power\n!rowspan = 2 |Speed\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Belt Armor]]\n!colspan = 2 |[[Deck (ship)|Decks]]\n!colspan = 3 |Armament\n|-\n|Upper\n|Lower\n|Primary\n|Secondary\n|Tertiary\n|-\n|No. 1\n|{{cvt|252|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|35|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|40000|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|45500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|170000|shp}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|31|kn}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|330|mm}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{cvt|170|\u2013|180|mm}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{cvt|40|mm}}\n|9 \u00d7 [[380mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}}]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |9 \u00d7 [[152mm/55 Mod\u00e8le 1930 gun|{{cvt|152|mm|0}}]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |16 \u00d7 {{cvt|100|mm}}\n|-\n|No. 2\n|{{cvt|256|m|ftin}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|35.5|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|42500|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|47800|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|190000|shp}}\n|9 \u00d7 {{cvt|406|mm|0}}\n|-\n|No. 3\n|{{cvt|265|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|45000|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|51500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|220000|shp}}\n|{{cvt|32|kn}}\n|{{cvt|350|mm|1}}\n|12 \u00d7 380&nbsp;mm\n|24 \u00d7 100&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nDarlan and the rest of the naval command evaluated the design proposals, but the choice was obvious from the start according to the historians John Jordan and Robert Dumas. No. 2, armed with 406&nbsp;mm guns, would have introduced a fourth caliber to the French battle line (after the 380&nbsp;mm guns of the ''Richelieu''s, the {{cvt|330|mm|0}} guns of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}}s, and the {{cvt|340|mm}} guns of the older {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|5}}s). Additionally, the 406&nbsp;mm gun had not yet been produced, so the necessary design work might have delayed completion of the new ships. The No. 3 type was simply too large for existing naval bases to easily accommodate. This left No. 1 as the only realistic option for the next battleship program.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=180}} Historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin disagree, however, pointing out that the French Navy had never built a three-gun turret before. Building the ships under wartime constraints (and with the need to produce the ship as quickly as possible), repeating the four-gun turrets of the ''Richelieu''s made the most sense, and they argue that the No. 3 design was the most likely version to be built.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nGarzke and Dulin project that a finalized No. 3 design would have had a [[full-load displacement]] of {{cvt|55125|LT|t}}, which would have included lengthening the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] to {{cvt|270|m}} with the same beam of 35.5&nbsp;m. At these dimensions, the [[draft (nautical)|draft]] would have been {{cvt|9.25|m}}, and with {{cvt|197200|shp}}, the ship could have been propelled at a speed of at least 30&nbsp;knots. They estimate that the projected battery of twenty-four 100&nbsp;mm guns would have been cut in half, in line with the other variants, and eighteen 37&nbsp;mm guns would have been carried. They expect the belt would have been increased to a maximum of {{cvt|360|mm|1}} with an incline of 15.5&nbsp;degrees from the vertical to improve its resistance to long-range fire. According to their design study, the main deck would have been reduced slightly, to 170&nbsp;mm over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and {{cvt|150|mm}} over the propulsion machinery spaces.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=146}}\n\nTwo of the new ships were authorized on 1 April 1940. The first vessel was slated to be [[keel laying|laid down]] at the No. 1 slipway at Saint-Nazaire after ''Joffre'' was to be launched in 1941, displacing ''Painlev\u00e9'', which was not reallocated to another builder before the program ended. The second member of the class was to be laid down in 1942 in the new No. 10 dock in Brest, which was to have been completed by that time. On 15 May 1940, the navy proposed four names for the first two ships for Darlan to select; these were ''Alsace'', ''Normandie'', ''Flandre'', and ''Bourgogne''. According to Garzke and Dulin, the government considered authorizing two more vessels, though no contracts were placed. Initial orders for building material were scheduled for mid-1940, but following the German victory in the [[Battle of France]] by June, all French naval construction programs came to an end.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=180}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=146}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commonscat|Alsace class battleships}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Breyer\n  | first = Siegfried\n  | title = Battleships and Battle Cruisers 1905\u20131970\n  | year = 1973\n  | publisher = Macdonald and Jane's\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-356-04191-9\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Breyer}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Garzke\n  |first1=William H., Jr.\n  |last2=Dulin\n  |first2=Robert O., Jr.\n  |title=British, Soviet, French, and Dutch Battleships of World War II\n  |year=1980\n  |publisher=Naval Institute Press\n  |location=Annapolis\n  |isbn=978-0-87021-100-3\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Garzke & Dulin}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Jordan\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Dumas\n  |first2=Robert\n  |title=French Battleships 1922\u20131956\n  |publisher=Seaforth Punblishing\n  |isbn=978-1-84832-034-5\n  |year=2009\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Jordan & Dumas}}\n  | lastauthoramp = y\n  }}\n\n{{Alsace class battleship}}\n{{WWIIFrenchShips}}\n{{Late battleships}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alsace-class battleship}}\n[[Category:Battleship classes]]\n[[Category:Battleships of the French Navy]]\n[[Category:Proposed ships]]\n[[Category:Abandoned military projects of France]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{| {{Infobox ship begin\n}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n| Ship image = Alsace.svg\n| Ship caption = Illustration of the No. 3 variant\n}}\n{{Infobox ship class overview\n| Name = ''Alsace'' class\n| Class before = {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}\n| Class after = None\n| Total ships planned = 4\n| Total ships completed = 0\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = (No. 1 design)\n| Ship class = \n| Ship type = [[Battleship]]\n| Ship tonnage = \n| Ship displacement = \n*[[Standard displacement]]: {{cvt|40000|LT|t}}\n*Normal: {{cvt|45500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n| Ship length = {{cvt|252|m|ft}}\n| Ship beam = {{cvt|35|m|ftin}}\n| Ship power = {{cvt|170000|shp|lk=in}}\n| Ship speed = {{convert|31|kn|lk=in}}\n| Ship complement = \n| Ship armament = \n*3 \u00d7 triple [[380mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}} guns]]\n*3 \u00d7 triple [[Canon de 152 mm Mod\u00e8le 1930|{{cvt|152|mm|0}} guns]]\n*8 \u00d7 twin {{cvt|100|mm}} [[anti-aircraft gun|AA guns]]\n*?? \u00d7 {{cvt|37|mm}} AA guns\n*?? x {{cvt|25|mm}} AA guns\n| Ship armor =\n*Belt: {{cvt|330|mm}}\n*Upper [[Deck (ship)|deck]]: {{cvt|170|to|180|mm}}\n*Lower deck: {{cvt|40|mm}}\n| Ship aircraft = \n| Ship aircraft facilities = \n| Ship notes = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = (No. 2 design)\n| Ship displacement = \n*Standard: {{cvt|42500|LT|t}}\n*Normal: {{cvt|47800|t|LT|order=flip}}\n| Ship length = {{cvt|256|m|ft}}\n| Ship beam = {{cvt|35.5|m|ftin}}\n| Ship power = {{cvt|190000|shp|lk=in}}\n| Ship speed = 31&nbsp;knots\n| Ship complement = \n| Ship armament = \n*3 \u00d7 triple {{cvt|406|mm|0}} guns\n*3 \u00d7 triple 152&nbsp;mm guns\n*8 \u00d7 twin 100&nbsp;mm AA guns\n*?? \u00d7 37&nbsp;mm AA guns\n*?? x 25&nbsp;mm AA guns\n| Ship armor =\n*Belt: 330&nbsp;mm\n*Upper deck: 170\u2013180&nbsp;mm\n*Deck: 40&nbsp;mm\n| Ship aircraft = \n| Ship aircraft facilities = \n| Ship notes = \n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n| Hide header = \n| Header caption = (No. 3 design)\n| Ship displacement = \n*Standard: {{cvt|45000|LT|t}}\n*Normal: {{cvt|51500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n| Ship length = {{cvt|265|m|ft}}\n| Ship beam = 35.5&nbsp;m\n| Ship power = {{cvt|220000|shp|lk=in}}\n| Ship speed = {{convert|32|kn|lk=in}}\n| Ship complement = \n| Ship armament = \n*3 \u00d7 quadruple 380&nbsp;mm guns\n*3 \u00d7 triple 152&nbsp;mm guns\n*12 \u00d7 twin 100&nbsp;mm AA guns\n*?? \u00d7 37&nbsp;mm AA guns\n*?? x 25&nbsp;mm AA guns\n| Ship armor =\n*Belt: {{cvt|350|mm|1}}\n*Upper deck: 170\u2013180&nbsp;mm\n*Deck: 40&nbsp;mm\n| Ship aircraft = \n| Ship aircraft facilities = \n| Ship notes = \n}}\n|}\n\nThe '''''Alsace'' class''' was a group of two [[fast battleship]]s planned by the [[French Navy]] in the late 1930s in response to German plans to build two [[H-class battleship proposals|H-class battleships]] after the [[Second London Naval Treaty]] collapsed.

This development led ''Vice-Amiral'' (Vice Admiral) [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]], the [[Chief of Staff of the French Navy]], to order design studies for new battleships that exceeded the 35,000-ton limit. Darlan specified that the armament was to be {{cvt|400|mm|1}}, 406&nbsp;mm, or {{cvt|420|mm|1}}.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=177}}{{sfn|Breyer|pp=305\u2013309}}\n\n==Infrastructure concerns==\nIn the late 1930s, there were only three existing [[slipway]]s capable of building large ships: The No. 4 dock at [[Brest, France|Brest]] and the ''Forme Caquot'' and No. 1 docks in [[Saint-Nazaire]]. The No. 4 dock was only {{cvt|250|m}}, too short to build any vessel larger than the ''Richelieu''s (which themselves had to be built without their bow or stern and completed after launching), and the No. 1 dock in Saint-Nazaire was already occupied with building the [[aircraft carrier]] {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Joffre||2}} (and was slated to begin construction of her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Painlev\u00e9||2}} after the latter's projected launch in 1941).{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=179}}\n\nTo build battleships to compete with the German H-class vessels, the French Navy would need to embark on a major program to improve its infrastructure. The Laninon Docks at the [[Arsenal de Brest]] were to be significantly expanded; a new, longer dock (that would be designated Dock No. 10) that was {{cvt|275|m}} long and {{cvt|58|m}} wide was to be excavated, which would have been large enough to construct the ''Alsace'' class. A new {{cvt|360|m}} long [[graving dock]] was to be built, and the existing Dock No. 9 was to be lengthened from 250&nbsp;m to {{cvt|300|m}}. Dock No. 10 was slated to be completed by 1942, at which point work on the graving dock would begin, as budgetary limitations and a shortage of skilled workers prevented both facilities from being built at the same time. At a later date, Dock No. 10 was to be lengthened to 360&nbsp;m as well.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=178}}\n\nIn addition to shipbuilding facilities, the new battleships would necessitate improved repair and harbor facilities at the various major naval bases. Port facilities had already been built or were in the process of construction at [[Cherbourg]], [[Toulon]], [[Casablanca]], [[Bizerta]], and [[Dakar]], though dry-docks in those ports were not sufficient to handle even a ''Richelieu'' in a damaged condition (where flooding would increase [[draft (hull)|draft]] of more than {{cvt|11|m}}). It was estimated that these docks would need to be dredged to at least {{cvt|12|m}} to accommodate the ''Alsace'' design. The navy had to acquire other equipment, including the [[tugboat]]s necessary to maneuver the ships in port and [[floating crane]]s needed to [[fitting-out|fit out]] the vessels, but shortages in machinery slowed construction and owing to the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, France was unable to order the vessels from neutral countries.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=178}}\n\n== Design proposals ==\nDesign work began in late 1939; three versions were prepared, all of which were developments of the Project C type that was created during the design process for the [[Richelieu-class_battleship#Clemenceau_and_Gascogne_variants|''Clemenceau'' and ''Gascogne'' variants]] of the ''Richelieu'' class. Unlike the standard ''Richelieu'' type that mounted all eight of their main battery guns in a pair of four-[[gun turret]]s forward, the Project C design adopted an arrangement with two three-gun turrets forward and one triple turret aft. The design staff considered three [[standard displacement]]s; {{cvt|40000|LT|t}}, {{cvt|42500|LT|t}}, and {{cvt|45000|LT|t}}. The first was the same figure proposed for the British {{sclass-|Lion|battleship|1}}s and that incorrectly assumed for the German H-class ships, the third was the maximum under the agreement reached with Britain and the United States, and the third was a compromise displacement figured to be the minimum that could accommodate the mandated top speed of at least {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}} along with a battery of 406&nbsp;mm guns.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=179\u2013180}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=145}} \n\nThe first proposal for ''Alsace'', No. 1, was essentially a slightly enlarged version of Project C. The ship had a longer hull, which required a {{convert|15000|shp|lk=on}} increase in [[horsepower]] while incurring a loss of one knot in top speed. No. 2 was a scaled up version of No. 1, with the 380&nbsp;mm guns replaced with 406&nbsp;mm guns. The even larger hull necessitated a further increase in horsepower by {{cvt|20000|shp}} to maintain the same speed. The No. 3 type was enlarged further to accommodate three quadruple 380&nbsp;mm turrets, though it managed to increase speed by a knot. All of the designs would have carried a light anti-aircraft battery of {{cvt|37|mm}} and {{cvt|25|mm}} guns, but the numbers and arrangements of those guns had not been finalized before the program came to an end.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|+Characteristics{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=177}}\n!rowspan = 2 |Design\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Length overall]]\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Beam (nautical)|Beam]]\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Standard displacement]]\n!rowspan = 2 |Normal displacement\n!rowspan = 2 |Power\n!rowspan = 2 |Speed\n!rowspan = 2 |[[Belt Armor]]\n!colspan = 2 |[[Deck (ship)|Decks]]\n!colspan = 3 |Armament\n|-\n|Upper\n|Lower\n|Primary\n|Secondary\n|Tertiary\n|-\n|No. 1\n|{{cvt|252|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|35|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|40000|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|45500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|170000|shp}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|31|kn}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|330|mm}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{cvt|170|\u2013|180|mm}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" | {{cvt|40|mm}}\n|9 \u00d7 [[380mm/45 Mod\u00e8le 1935 gun|{{cvt|380|mm}}]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |9 \u00d7 [[152mm/55 Mod\u00e8le 1930 gun|{{cvt|152|mm|0}}]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" |16 \u00d7 {{cvt|100|mm}}\n|-\n|No. 2\n|{{cvt|256|m|ftin}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{cvt|35.5|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|42500|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|47800|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|190000|shp}}\n|9 \u00d7 {{cvt|406|mm|0}}\n|-\n|No. 3\n|{{cvt|265|m|ftin}}\n|{{cvt|45000|LT|t}}\n|{{cvt|51500|t|LT|order=flip}}\n|{{cvt|220000|shp}}\n|{{cvt|32|kn}}\n|{{cvt|350|mm|1}}\n|12 \u00d7 380&nbsp;mm\n|24 \u00d7 100&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nDarlan and the rest of the naval command evaluated the design proposals, but the choice was obvious from the start according to the historians John Jordan and Robert Dumas. No. 2, armed with 406&nbsp;mm guns, would have introduced a fourth caliber to the French battle line (after the 380&nbsp;mm guns of the ''Richelieu''s, the {{cvt|330|mm|0}} guns of the {{sclass-|Dunkerque|battleship|5}}s, and the {{cvt|340|mm}} guns of the older {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|5}}s). Additionally, the 406&nbsp;mm gun had not yet been produced, so the necessary design work might have delayed completion of the new ships. The No. 3 type was simply too large for existing naval bases to easily accommodate. This left No. 1 as the only realistic option for the next battleship program.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=180}} Historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin disagree, however, pointing out that the French Navy had never built a three-gun turret before. Building the ships under wartime constraints (and with the need to produce the ship as quickly as possible), repeating the four-gun turrets of the ''Richelieu''s made the most sense, and they argue that the No. 3 design was the most likely version to be built.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=145\u2013146}}\n\nGarzke and Dulin project that a finalized No. 3 design would have had a [[full-load displacement]] of {{cvt|55125|LT|t}}, which would have included lengthening the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] to {{cvt|270|m}} with the same beam of 35.5&nbsp;m. At these dimensions, the [[draft (nautical)|draft]] would have been {{cvt|9.25|m}}, and with {{cvt|197200|shp}}, the ship could have been propelled at a speed of at least 30&nbsp;knots. They estimate that the projected battery of twenty-four 100&nbsp;mm guns would have been cut in half, in line with the other variants, and eighteen 37&nbsp;mm guns would have been carried. They expect the belt would have been increased to a maximum of {{cvt|360|mm|1}} with an incline of 15.5&nbsp;degrees from the vertical to improve its resistance to long-range fire. According to their design study, the main deck would have been reduced slightly, to 170&nbsp;mm over the [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]] and {{cvt|150|mm}} over the propulsion machinery spaces.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=146}}\n\nTwo of the new ships were authorized on 1 April 1940. The first vessel was slated to be [[keel laying|laid down]] at the No. 1 slipway at Saint-Nazaire after ''Joffre'' was to be launched in 1941, displacing ''Painlev\u00e9'', which was not reallocated to another builder before the program ended. The second member of the class was to be laid down in 1942 in the new No. 10 dock in Brest, which was to have been completed by that time. On 15 May 1940, the navy proposed four names for the first two ships for Darlan to select; these were ''Alsace'', ''Normandie'', ''Flandre'', and ''Bourgogne''. According to Garzke and Dulin, the government considered authorizing two more vessels, though no contracts were placed. Initial orders for building material were scheduled for mid-1940, but following the German victory in the [[Battle of France]] by June, all French naval construction programs came to an end.{{sfn|Jordan & Dumas|p=180}}{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=146}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{commonscat|Alsace class battleships}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Breyer\n  | first = Siegfried\n  | title = Battleships and Battle Cruisers 1905\u20131970\n  | year = 1973\n  | publisher = Macdonald and Jane's\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-356-04191-9\n  | ref = {{sfnRef|Breyer}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Garzke\n  |first1=William H., Jr.\n  |last2=Dulin\n  |first2=Robert O., Jr.\n  |title=British, Soviet, French, and Dutch Battleships of World War II\n  |year=1980\n  |publisher=Naval Institute Press\n  |location=Annapolis\n  |isbn=978-0-87021-100-3\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Garzke & Dulin}}\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  |last1=Jordan\n  |first1=John\n  |last2=Dumas\n  |first2=Robert\n  |title=French Battleships 1922\u20131956\n  |publisher=Seaforth Punblishing\n  |isbn=978-1-84832-034-5\n  |year=2009\n  |location=Barnsley\n  |ref={{sfnRef|Jordan & Dumas}}\n  | lastauthoramp = y\n  }}\n\n{{Alsace class battleship}}\n{{WWIIFrenchShips}}\n{{Late battleships}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alsace-class battleship}}\n[[Category:Battleship classes]]\n[[Category:Battleships of the French Navy]]\n[[Category:Proposed ships]]\n[[Category:Abandoned military projects of France]]\n", "name_user": "47.215.230.158", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace-class_battleship"}

point]]s by size''', measured by peak data rate ([[throughput]]), with additional data on location, establishment and average throughput.\n\nGenerally only exchanges with more than ten [[gigabit per second|gigabits per second]] peak throughput have been taken into consideration. The numbers in the list represent switched traffic only (no private interconnects) and are rounded to whole gigabits. Take into consideration that traffic on each exchange point can change quickly, and be seasonal.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, as it includes only exchanges willing to make traffic data public on their website. Particularly data of IXPs from the [[United States]] and [[China]] is hard to come by. Examples of large peering points without public data are [[NAP of the Americas]] or [[PacketExchange]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" <!-- style=\"text-align:right\" -->\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

The Westar [[satellite]]s' [[transponder]]s were also leased by other companies for relaying [[video]], [[Voice message|voice]], [[data]], and facsimile (fax) transmissions.\n\nIn 1963, Western Union organized its international cable system properties and its right-of-way for connecting international telegraph lines into a separate company called Western Union International (WUI) which it divested that year to American Securities. In 1967 WUI underwent an IPO. In 1979 it was sold to [[Xerox]] for $207 million in stock.

Note that the message text is a continuous strip of paper which was cut and glued to the telegram form.]]\nIn 1987, Investor [[Bennett S. LeBow]] acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that was a complex leveraged recapitalization. The transaction was backed by a total of $900 million in [[junk bonds|high-yield bonds and preferred stock]] underwritten by [[Michael Milken]]'s group at [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as part of an exchange offer. LeBow installed Robert J. Amman as President and CEO who led a complete strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company over the next six years.\n\nAmman executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services, with a money transfer business as a large but less important part of the business, into being a provider of consumer-based [[money transmitter|money transfer financial services]]. Thus, Amman ran the company as two separate companies. One business consisted of the money transfer business, which was funded and operated to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity. The second unit consisted of all the non-strategic communications assets such as the [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] analog voice network, satellite business and undersea cable assets. In the 3-year period through 1990 Amman was supported by [[Robert A. Schriesheim]], also installed by LeBow, as a special advisor who oversaw the divestiture of the four non-strategic telecommunications assets for about $280 million.\n\nThe official name of the corporation was changed to [[New Valley Corporation]] in 1991, just in time for that entity to seek bankruptcy protection as part of Amman's strategy to eliminate the overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business.

LeBow]] acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that was a complex leveraged recapitalization. The transaction was backed by a total of $900 million in [[junk bonds|high-yield bonds and preferred stock]] underwritten by [[Michael Milken]]'s group at [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]] as part of an exchange offer. LeBow installed Robert J. Amman as President and CEO who led a complete strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company over the next six years.\n\nAmman executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services, with a money transfer business as a large but less important part of the business, into being a provider of consumer-based [[money transmitter|money transfer financial services]]. Thus, Amman ran the company as two separate companies. One business consisted of the money transfer business, which was funded and operated to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity. The second unit consisted of all the non-strategic communications assets such as the [[long-distance calling|long-distance]] analog voice network, satellite business and undersea cable assets. In the 3-year period through 1990 Amman was supported by [[Robert A. Schriesheim]], also installed by LeBow, as a special advisor who oversaw the divestiture of the four non-strategic telecommunications assets for about $280 million.\n\nThe official name of the corporation was changed to [[New Valley Corporation]] in 1991, just in time for that entity to seek bankruptcy protection as part of Amman's strategy to eliminate the overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business.

One day, she forged a permission note from her mother and went to [[Sascha-Film]], where she was hired at the age of 16 as a [[script girl]]. She gained a role as an [[extra (acting)|extra]] in ''[[Money on the Street]]'' (1930), and then a small speaking part in ''[[Storm in a Water Glass]]'' (1931). Producer [[Max Reinhardt]] cast her in a play entitled ''The Weaker Sex'', which was performed at the [[Theater in der Josefstadt]]. Reinhardt was so impressed with her that he arranged for her to return with him to [[Berlin]], where he was based.{{sfn|Barton|2010|pp=16\u201319}}\n\nKiesler never trained with Reinhardt nor appeared in any of his Berlin productions. After meeting Russian theatre producer [[Alexis Granowsky]], she was cast in his film directorial debut, ''[[The Trunks of Mr. O.F.]]'' (1931), starring [[Walter Abel]] and [[Peter Lorre]].{{sfn|Barton|2010|pp=21\u201322}} Granowsky soon moved to Paris, but Kiesler stayed in Berlin to work.

She played the neglected young wife of an indifferent older man.\n\nThe film became both celebrated and notorious for showing the actress's face in the throes of an orgasm. According to Marie Benedict's book ''The Only Woman In The Room,'' Kiesler's expression resulted from someone sticking her with a pin. She was also shown in closeups and brief nude scenes, the latter reportedly a result of the actress being \"duped\" by the director and producer, who used high-power [[telephoto lens]]es.<ref name=Liberty>\"A Candid Portrait of Hedy Lamarr\", ''Liberty'' magazine, December 1938, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>{{efn|When Lamarr applied for the role, she had little experience nor understood the planned filming. Anxious for the job, she signed the contract without reading it. When, during an outdoor scene, the director told her to disrobe, she protested and threatened to quit, but he said that if she refused, she would have to pay for the cost of all the scenes already filmed. To calm her, he said they were using \"long shots\" in any case, and no intimate details would be visible. At the preview in Prague, sitting next to the director, when she saw the numerous close-ups produced with telephoto lenses, she screamed at him for tricking her.
