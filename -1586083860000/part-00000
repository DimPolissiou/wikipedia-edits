The BBC is a public corporation of the [[UK government]]'s [[Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/bbc|title=BBC - profile|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> It has the largest audience of any channel, with an estimated 121 million viewers weekly in 2016/2017, part of the estimated 372&nbsp;million weekly audience of the BBC's four main international news services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/global-audience-measure|title=BBC \u2013 BBC's global audience rises to 372m \u2013 Media Centre|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Launched on 11 March 1991 as ''[[BBC World Service Television]]'' outside Europe, its name was changed to ''BBC World'' on 16 January 1995 and to ''BBC World News'' on 21 April 2008. It broadcasts news bulletins, documentaries, lifestyle programmes and interview shows. Unlike the BBC's domestic channels, BBC World News is owned and operated by BBC Global News Ltd., part of the BBC's commercial group of companies, and is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom television licence]]. It is not owned by [[BBC Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|last=BBC|title=BBC News  \u2013 About BBC World News TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[CNN International]], [[Al Jazeera English]], [[NHK World-Japan|NHK World]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], and [[RT (TV network)|RT]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|BBC World Service Television}}\nThe channel originally started as BBC World Service Television and was a commercial operation. The [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] refused to fund to the new television service using grant-in-aid. ([[BBC World Service|BBC World Service radio]] was funded by a [[grant-in-aid]] from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT.\n\nOn Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], BBC World Service Television was split into two services:\n* BBC World started broadcasting on Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became a 24-hour English free-to-air international news channel.\n* [[BBC Prime]] started broadcasting on Monday, 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became the BBC's light entertainment channel, later renamed ''[[BBC Entertainment]]''.\n\nBBC World's on-air design was changed significantly on 3 April 2000, bringing it closer to the look of its sister channel in the UK which was then known as BBC News 24, the on-air look of which had been redesigned in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0004/S00001.htm|title=BBC World Unveils A New Look and a New Schedule \u2013 Scoop News|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> The look of both channels was made up of red and cream and designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], a departure from the general orchestral nature of music used by other news programmes.\n\nOn 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 2000. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became ''Putting News First'', replacing ''Demand a Broader View''.\n\nThe channel's present name \"BBC World News\" was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a \u00a3550,000 rebranding of the BBC's overall news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated studio vacated by BBC News 24 (now the BBC News Channel). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe.\n\n===Move to Broadcasting House===\nBBC World News relocated to [[Broadcasting House]] from its previous home at [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of \u00a31&nbsp;billion. A new newsroom and several state-of-the-art studios were built.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|title=The news from the BBC: its \u00a31bn new base is finally coming on air|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/07/bbc-1bn-new-base-broadcasting|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nLive news output originates from studios B and C in [[Broadcasting House]] with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC [[Millbank]] studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.\n\nPreviously, the channel was broadcast in [[aspect ratio (image)|4:3]], with the news output fitted into a [[14:9]] frame for both [[Digital television|digital]] and [[Analog television|analogue]] broadcasting, resulting in [[Letterbox|black bands]] at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to [[16:9]] format, initially in Europe on [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|Astra 1L satellite]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRISaJNfTM|title=BBC World News goes widescreen |date=13 January 2009|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009. The channel ceased broadcasting on analogue satellite on 18 April 2006.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20091227042257fw_/http://www.selkirkshire.demon.co.uk/analoguesat/2006news.html</ref>\n\n===High-definition===\nAs a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC World News gained high-definition studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in [[High-definition television|high-definition]]. On 5 August 2013, BBC World News was offered as a [[High-definition television|High Definition]] (HD) feed across the [[Middle East]] when it launched its international HD channel on [[Arabsat]].

BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and caf\u00e9).\n\nHowever, some BBC World News programmes are officially available to UK audiences.  Such programmes air on the BBC's domestic channels and some are available on-demand on the BBC's iPlayer.  From 00.00 to 05.00 UK time, the top-of-the-hour news bulletins on BBC World News are simulcast on the BBC News Channel.  At 01.30 weekdays, ''Asia Business Report'' and ''Sport Today'' also air on both channels.  There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on [[BBC One]] and the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]]. This programme was previously branded as ''''The World Today'''' (later a generic BBC World News bulletin) and ''World Business Report'' respectively.  At 08.30 UK time, [[Worklife (TV programme)|''Worklife'']] airs on the BBC News Channel.  BBC World News also produces a version of ''[[Outside Source]]'' at 21:00 UK time Monday-Thursday (seen on the BBC News Channel), ''World News Today'' at 19:00 Monday-Friday (seen on BBC Four), and 21:00 Friday-Sunday (seen on the BBC News Channel).  ''World News Today'' replaced ''The World'', which had been broadcast as a simulcast on BBC Four between 2002 and 2007.\n\nBoth World and the BBC News Channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news programme due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.\n\n==Programming==\nLive news programmes:<ref>{{cite web|last=BBC|title=Programmes \u2013 BBC World News|url=http://www.bbcwwpartners.com/worldnews/programming|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n* ''BBC World News'' \u2013 International news.\n* ''[[GMT (TV series)|GMT]]'' \u2013 International news, including business and sport.\n* ''[[Impact (TV programme)|Impact]]'' \u2013 Global news as it affects audiences in Asia.\n* ''[[Global (TV series)|Global]]'' \u2013 International news and analysis.\n* ''[[Outside Source]]'' \u2013 Discussion and analysis of news topics.\n* ''[[Newsday (TV series)|Newsday]]'' \u2013 Live from Singapore and London, news and analysis from both an Asian and global perspective.\n* ''[[BBC World News America]]'' \u2013 News from America and around the world, live from the BBC's Washington DC bureau.\n* ''[[Focus on Africa (TV programme)|Focus on Africa]]'' \u2013 BBC World News' flagship African news programme, with news, business and sport from the continent.\n* ''[[Beyond 100 Days]]'' \u2013 [[Katty Kay]] in Washington and [[Christian Fraser]] in London report on international news, with a focus on the UK, Europe and the US (previously branded as ''100 Days'' and ''100 Days +'').\n* ''[[World News Today]]'' \u2013 A daily news programme with in-depth analysis.

The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]].\n\nOn PBS stations, ''BBC World News'' is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the [[Met Office]] international [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are [[Broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] on some stations.\n\n[[BBC America]] were aired a three-hour block of BBC World News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and it is broadcast with advertisements.\n\nMany airlines from across the world also play pre-recorded extracts of the BBC World News, have text headlines from it or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems.\n\n===Previous bulletins===\nAnother BBC World News programme, the hour-long ''[[BBC World News America]]'', aired on BBC America at 19:00 [[Eastern Time]]. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that ''BBC World News America'' would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local [[PBS]] stations in the US as a 30-minute program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news|title='BBC World News America' Shifts To BBC World News|date=18 February 2011|first=Kent|last=Gibbons|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927043935/https://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news|archive-date=27 September 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:\n* [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] service from [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay]] to [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi International Airport]]\n* [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]] service from [[Airport Express (MTR)|Chek Lap Kok International Airport]]-[[Disneyland Resort station]] to [[Disneyland Resort line]]\n\nThese broadcasts began with the statement: \"Welcome to BBC World News on board the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]]\". The short bulletin was updated twice a day, and has since been replaced by a similar programme from [[MediaCorp]]'s [[Channel NewsAsia]].\n\nTravellers on the [[Heathrow Express]] rail service between [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] and [[London Heathrow Airport]] could watch a summary of the headlines from BBC World News on the LCD screens provided.\n\n==News presenters==\n{{About||full list of current presenters|List of BBC newsreaders and reporters#BBC World News}}\n\n===Former presenters===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Samira Ahmed]]\n* [[Karen Bowerman]]\n* [[Tony Campion]]\n* [[Jonathan Charles]]\n* [[Stephen Cole (broadcaster)|Stephen Cole]]\n* [[James Dagwell]]\n* [[Dharshini David]]\n* [[Martine Dennis]]\n* [[Juliet Dunlop]]\n* [[Maya Even]]\n* [[Adrian Finighan]]\n* [[Donald MacCormick]]\n* [[Anita McNaught]]\n* [[Richard Quest]]\n* [[Daniela Ritorto]]\n* [[Owen Thomas (journalist)|Owen Thomas]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Presentation==\n[[File:BBC World News countdown.png|thumb|right|250px|Part of the countdown sequence in 2013, showing Broadcasting House]]\nBBC World News is, for the most part, the same channel all over the world; the [[Advertising|commercials]] are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and ''The Record Europe'', which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather forecasts focus more on the area the viewer is watching from.\n\nOn most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the [[commercial break]]. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the US on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.\n\nOn 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.\n\nSince its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]], the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air. The countdown can range from 45 seconds to as little as 3 seconds.\n\n==Awards==\nBBC World News was named ''Best International News Channel'' at the [[Association for International Broadcasting]] Awards in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/ |title=Key Dates |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC World News}}</ref> It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2007 for ''White Horse Village''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village|title=2007 Peabody Awards: White Horse Village (BBC America)|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127070413/https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village|archive-date=27 January 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> and another in 2009 for ''Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence|title=2009 Peabody Awards: Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence (BBC America)|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912080730/https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence|archive-date=12 September 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/}}\n\n{{BBC News}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list1=\n{{World news channels}}\n  {{BBC Television}}\n  {{BBC World Service}}\n  {{Television in Greece}}\n  {{Television in the Netherlands}}\n  {{AMC Networks}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc World News}}\n[[Category:BBC World News]]\n[[Category:BBC News channels]]\n[[Category:International BBC television channels]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1995]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Flanders]]\n[[Category:Multilingual news services]]\n[[Category:24-hour television news channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:International broadcasters]]\n\n[[vi:BBC World News]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|International news and current affairs television channel}}\n{{About|the international news and current affairs channel|the BBC radio network|BBC World Service}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox television channel\n| name = BBC World News\n| logofile = BBC_World_News_2019.svg\n| logosize = 150px\n| logocaption =\n| launch = {{start date and age|1995|1|16|df=y}}\n| picture format = [[1080i]] [[HDTV]]<br />{{small|(downscaled to [[16:9]] for the [[SDTV]] feeds.

It broadcasts news bulletins, documentaries, lifestyle programmes and interview shows. Unlike the BBC's domestic channels, BBC World News is owned and operated by BBC Global News Ltd., part of the BBC's commercial group of companies, and is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom television licence]]. It is not owned by [[BBC Studios]].<ref>{{cite web|last=BBC|title=BBC News  \u2013 About BBC World News TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to [[CNN International]], [[Al Jazeera English]], [[NHK World-Japan|NHK World]], [[Deutsche Welle|DW]], and [[RT (TV network)|RT]].\n\n==History==\n{{See also|BBC World Service Television}}\nThe channel originally started as BBC World Service Television and was a commercial operation. The [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] refused to fund to the new television service using grant-in-aid. ([[BBC World Service|BBC World Service radio]] was funded by a [[grant-in-aid]] from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT.\n\nOn Thursday, 26 January 1995 at 19:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]], BBC World Service Television was split into two services:\n* BBC World started broadcasting on Monday, 16 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became a 24-hour English free-to-air international news channel.\n* [[BBC Prime]] started broadcasting on Monday, 30 January 1995 at 19:00 GMT and became the BBC's light entertainment channel, later renamed ''[[BBC Entertainment]]''.\n\nBBC World's on-air design was changed significantly on 3 April 2000, bringing it closer to the look of its sister channel in the UK which was then known as BBC News 24, the on-air look of which had been redesigned in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0004/S00001.htm|title=BBC World Unveils A New Look and a New Schedule \u2013 Scoop News|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2016}}</ref> The look of both channels was made up of red and cream and designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], a departure from the general orchestral nature of music used by other news programmes.\n\nOn 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 2000. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became ''Putting News First'', replacing ''Demand a Broader View''.\n\nThe channel's present name \"BBC World News\" was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a \u00a3550,000 rebranding of the BBC's overall news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated studio vacated by BBC News 24 (now the BBC News Channel). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe.\n\n===Move to Broadcasting House===\nBBC World News relocated to [[Broadcasting House]] from its previous home at [[Television Centre, London|Television Centre]] on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of \u00a31&nbsp;billion. A new newsroom and several state-of-the-art studios were built.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sabbagh|first=Dan|title=The news from the BBC: its \u00a31bn new base is finally coming on air|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/07/bbc-1bn-new-base-broadcasting|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\nLive news output originates from studios B and C in [[Broadcasting House]] with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC [[Millbank]] studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.\n\nPreviously, the channel was broadcast in [[aspect ratio (image)|4:3]], with the news output fitted into a [[14:9]] frame for both [[Digital television|digital]] and [[Analog television|analogue]] broadcasting, resulting in [[Letterbox|black bands]] at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to [[16:9]] format, initially in Europe on [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|Astra 1L satellite]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdRISaJNfTM|title=BBC World News goes widescreen |date=13 January 2009|accessdate=22 August 2010|publisher=YouTube}}</ref> and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009.

On 5 August 2013, BBC World News was offered as a [[High-definition television|High Definition]] (HD) feed across the [[Middle East]] when it launched its international HD channel on [[Arabsat]]. Arabsat was the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the channel in HD. On 1 April 2015 BBC World News in English started broadcasting in high definition from the 11.229&nbsp;GHz/V transponder on [[Astra 1KR]] at the [[Astra 19.2\u00b0E|19.2\u00b0E]] orbital position, available [[free-to-air]] to viewers with 60&nbsp;cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2015/bbc-world-news-hd-service-europe|title=BBC World News launches HD service in Europe|date=1 April 2015|publisher=BBC Media Centre|access-date=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Worldwide===\nBBC World News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|title=About BBC World News TV|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-12957296|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref> BBC World News is most commonly watched as a [[free-to-air]] (FTA) channel.

BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and caf\u00e9).\n\nHowever, some BBC World News programmes are officially available to UK audiences.  Such programmes air on the BBC's domestic channels and some are available on-demand on the BBC's iPlayer.  From 00.00 to 05.00 UK time, the top-of-the-hour news bulletins on BBC World News are simulcast on the BBC News Channel.  At 01.30 weekdays, ''Asia Business Report'' and ''Sport Today'' also air on both channels.  There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on [[BBC One]] and the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]]. This programme was previously branded as ''''The World Today'''' (later a generic BBC World News bulletin) and ''World Business Report'' respectively.  At 08.30 UK time, [[Worklife (TV programme)|''Worklife'']] airs on the BBC News Channel.  BBC World News also produces a version of ''[[Outside Source]]'' at 21:00 UK time Monday-Thursday (seen on the BBC News Channel), ''World News Today'' at 19:00 Monday-Friday (seen on BBC Four), and 21:00 Friday-Sunday (seen on the BBC News Channel).  ''World News Today'' replaced ''The World'', which had been broadcast as a simulcast on BBC Four between 2002 and 2007.\n\nBoth World and the BBC News Channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news programme due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.\n\n==Programming==\nLive news programmes:<ref>{{cite web|last=BBC|title=Programmes \u2013 BBC World News|url=http://www.bbcwwpartners.com/worldnews/programming|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n* ''BBC World News'' \u2013 International news.\n* ''[[GMT (TV series)|GMT]]'' \u2013 International news, including business and sport.\n* ''[[Impact (TV programme)|Impact]]'' \u2013 Global news as it affects audiences in Asia.\n* ''[[Global (TV series)|Global]]'' \u2013 International news and analysis.\n* ''[[Outside Source]]'' \u2013 Discussion and analysis of news topics.\n* ''[[Newsday (TV series)|Newsday]]'' \u2013 Live from Singapore and London, news and analysis from both an Asian and global perspective.\n* ''[[BBC World News America]]'' \u2013 News from America and around the world, live from the BBC's Washington DC bureau.\n* ''[[Focus on Africa (TV programme)|Focus on Africa]]'' \u2013 BBC World News' flagship African news programme, with news, business and sport from the continent.\n* ''[[Beyond 100 Days]]'' \u2013 [[Katty Kay]] in Washington and [[Christian Fraser]] in London report on international news, with a focus on the UK, Europe and the US (previously branded as ''100 Days'' and ''100 Days +'').\n* ''[[World News Today]]'' \u2013 A daily news programme with in-depth analysis.

The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]].\n\nOn PBS stations, ''BBC World News'' is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the [[Met Office]] international [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are [[Broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] on some stations.\n\n[[BBC America]] were aired a three-hour block of BBC World News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and it is broadcast with advertisements.\n\nMany airlines from across the world also play pre-recorded extracts of the BBC World News, have text headlines from it or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems.\n\n===Previous bulletins===\nAnother BBC World News programme, the hour-long ''[[BBC World News America]]'', aired on BBC America at 19:00 [[Eastern Time]]. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that ''BBC World News America'' would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local [[PBS]] stations in the US as a 30-minute program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news|title='BBC World News America' Shifts To BBC World News|date=18 February 2011|first=Kent|last=Gibbons|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927043935/https://www.multichannel.com/content/bbc-world-news-america-shifts-bbc-world-news|archive-date=27 September 2012|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:\n* [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] service from [[Marina Bay MRT station|Marina Bay]] to [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi International Airport]]\n* [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]] service from [[Airport Express (MTR)|Chek Lap Kok International Airport]]-[[Disneyland Resort station]] to [[Disneyland Resort line]]\n\nThese broadcasts began with the statement: \"Welcome to BBC World News on board the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]] and [[Hong Kong]] [[Mass Transit Railway]]\". The short bulletin was updated twice a day, and has since been replaced by a similar programme from [[MediaCorp]]'s [[Channel NewsAsia]].\n\nTravellers on the [[Heathrow Express]] rail service between [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]] and [[London Heathrow Airport]] could watch a summary of the headlines from BBC World News on the LCD screens provided.\n\n==News presenters==\n{{About||full list of current presenters|List of BBC newsreaders and reporters#BBC World News}}\n\n===Former presenters===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Samira Ahmed]]\n* [[Karen Bowerman]]\n* [[Tony Campion]]\n* [[Jonathan Charles]]\n* [[Stephen Cole (broadcaster)|Stephen Cole]]\n* [[James Dagwell]]\n* [[Dharshini David]]\n* [[Martine Dennis]]\n* [[Juliet Dunlop]]\n* [[Maya Even]]\n* [[Adrian Finighan]]\n* [[Donald MacCormick]]\n* [[Anita McNaught]]\n* [[Richard Quest]]\n* [[Daniela Ritorto]]\n* [[Owen Thomas (journalist)|Owen Thomas]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Presentation==\n[[File:BBC World News countdown.png|thumb|right|250px|Part of the countdown sequence in 2013, showing Broadcasting House]]\nBBC World News is, for the most part, the same channel all over the world; the [[Advertising|commercials]] are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and ''The Record Europe'', which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather forecasts focus more on the area the viewer is watching from.\n\nOn most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the [[commercial break]]. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the US on [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.\n\nOn 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions.{{clarify|date=February 2015}} The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.\n\nSince its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News channel]], the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air. The countdown can range from 45 seconds to as little as 3 seconds.\n\n==Awards==\nBBC World News was named ''Best International News Channel'' at the [[Association for International Broadcasting]] Awards in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/ |title=Key Dates |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |publisher=BBC World News}}</ref> It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2007 for ''White Horse Village''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village|title=2007 Peabody Awards: White Horse Village (BBC America)|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127070413/https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/white-horse-village|archive-date=27 January 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> and another in 2009 for ''Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence|title=2009 Peabody Awards: Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence (BBC America)|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912080730/https://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/where-giving-life-is-a-death-sentence|archive-date=12 September 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world_radio_and_tv/}}\n\n{{BBC News}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list1=\n{{World news channels}}\n  {{BBC Television}}\n  {{BBC World Service}}\n  {{Television in Greece}}\n  {{Television in the Netherlands}}\n  {{AMC Networks}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc World News}}\n[[Category:BBC World News]]\n[[Category:BBC News channels]]\n[[Category:International BBC television channels]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1995]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Television channels in Flanders]]\n[[Category:Multilingual news services]]\n[[Category:24-hour television news channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1995 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:International broadcasters]]\n\n[[vi:BBC World News]]\n", "name_user": "103.255.6.246", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Minor change)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_News"}

The [[Treaty of Rome]], establishing the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957, already expressed the necessity to instaure free movement of capital in between the member states. Then, the directive of 1988 implemented it by preventing any restriction on free capital flow.<ref>B\u00e2ch\u00e9 Jean-Pierre. La lib\u00e9ration des mouvements de capitaux : bilan et \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. In: Revue d'\u00e9conomie financi\u00e8re, n\u00b08-9, 1989. L\u2019Europe mon\u00e9taire : SME, \u00c9cu, Union mon\u00e9taire. pp. 104-111.</ref> In 1999 was created the [[Financial Services Action Plan|financial services action plan]], first step in creating a single market for capital, and in 2011 the [[European Supervisory Authority]], in order to insure the European financial markets stability. Only four years later, is the CMU project presented by Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n=== Characteristics of the EU financial system ===\nEU economy remains bank-oriented, especially when compared to the [[United States]].<ref name=\":8\">\u00ab Chapitre 1. Priorit\u00e9s pour l\u2019ach\u00e8vement du march\u00e9 unique \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 51-81.</ref> It means that corporations usually prefer to borrow money to the banking sector instead of financing their investments through [[Financial market|financial markets]]. According to the [[OECD]] analysis, this is partly due to the fiscal bias : in most European countries, firms benefit from tax advantages if their have to reimburse a bank loan, but that is not the case if they emitted obligations on the capital markets.<ref name=\":9\">\u00ab \u00c9valuation et recommandations \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 13-45.</ref> Therefore, there is a strong financial incentive for European companies to favour the banking sector. This high reliance on the banking system implies less stability for the European economy, hence the position of the European Commission, which advocates for a diversification of financing sources. <ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":10\">C\u0153ur\u00e9, B.

Whereas the [[United States]] population choose to invest in long-maturity-assets through [[Pension fund|pension funds]] or life insurances, European savers prefer easily accessible financial instruments, such as [[Deposit account|deposits]] or short-maturity-assets.<ref name=\":4\" /> This economic behaviour generates a lack of financial profitability of the EU and accentuate the importance of banks as the main funding providers of the [[Economy of Europe|European economy]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe third characteristic of the European financial system is that capital invested stay usually in the national market : it is the home bias.<ref>European Banking Authority, Benchmarking of Remuneration Practices at Union Level (London, June 2014).</ref> Even if before 2011, there was a positive trend for cross-border investments, most of the capital flow was remaining within the national frontiers of the [[Member state|member states]]<ref name=\":10\" /> and European financial integration is still limited.<ref name=\":4\" /> This lack of cross-border investments prevent high-growth-potential companies from getting the financial ressources they need to develop innovations and become more competitive.<ref>Thomas Philippon and Nicolas V eron, Financing Europe\u2019s Fast Movers (Bruegel Policy Brief 2008/01, January 2008).</ref> In fact, [[Shareholder|shareholders]] prefer buying shares from their national companies, creating an important hinder to European financial integration, because they have to face regulation barriers if they want to invest in another country of the EU.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Financial and political shocks ===\n==== Impact of the 2011 crisis ====\nThe [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|financial crisis]] had two main consequences on the financial integration of the European Union. Firstly, it showed the instability induced by an excessive reliance on banks' loans. When there is [[uncertainty]], the offer of [[credit]] is reduced, impacting negatively all the economic activities depending on it.<ref name=\":5\" /> It is especially the case for Europe, whose SMEs mainly get financed by the banking system.<ref name=\":10\" /> Dealing with the aftermaths of the 2011 crisis, the dependency of the EU economy on banks made it harder to growth and [[Employment rate|employment]], according to the former President of the European Commission.<ref>Jean-Claude Juncker, A New Start for Europe: My Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change, opening statement in the European Parliament session (European Commission, Strasbourg, 15 July 2014)</ref> Secondly, the financial crisis increased the fragmentation of the European capital markets by increasing the domestic bias.<ref name=\":12\">De Boissieu, Christian. \u00ab L\u2019Union des march\u00e9s de capitaux : une mise en perspective \u00bb, Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles, vol. ao\u00fbt 2018, no. 3, 2018, pp. 84-87.</ref>[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|Financial centre of the [[City of London]]. |269x269px]] There was a sensible reduction of cross-border investments after 2011.<ref name=\":4\" /> because the previous financial integration was led by banks investing on international financial markets. Once affected by the crisis, their withdrawal drove the European financial system to more fragmentation than before.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==== Impact of the Brexit ====\nMost of the financial power of the European Union is located in the [[The City: London and the Global Power of Finance|City, in London]].<ref name=\":4\" /> However, following the [[Brexit referendum|referendum of the 23rd of June 2016]], the United Kingdom initiated the procedure to get out of the European Union.<ref name=\":5\" /> Even if some British firms are moving the continental Europe, [[Brexit]] means the loss of most of the financial expertise of the EU.<ref name=\":12\" /> In spite of that, the European Commission asserted the consistency of the Capital Markets Union action plan, already launched at the time, and accelerated the efforts to implement it.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\n=== Economic goals===\n[[File:Illustration objectives.png|alt=|thumb|808x808px|Three levels of objectives of the CMU, as defined by the European Commission, which lead to the seven areas of intervention of the Capital Markets Union action plan. This graph was drawn according to the CMU 2017 [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/staff-working-document-cmu-mid-term-review-june2017_en.pdf mid-term review]]]\nThe European Commission designed 3 different levels of objectives for the Capital Markets Union, from the global economic goals to the more concrete necessity for the construction of an [[Financial integration|integrated financial system]]. These economic objectives frame the six intervention areas encompassed by the action plan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Overarching objectives====\n\n* '''Facilitating the financing of both private and public sector on the financial markets'''\n\nThe Capital Markets Union aims to ease the access of firms and states to financing, which has become more difficult since the financial crisis of 2010-2011. The creation of a single market for capital would send an incentive to [[Private investment fund|private]] and institutional actors to invest the capital available, by creating new possibilities of cross-border attractive investments.<ref name=\":10\" /> This renewed possibility of financing may help the economic agents to come back to the level of growth they had before the crisis, impacting positively the employment rate.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is especially true for SMEs <ref name=\":9\" />which might need more financing than what the banking system can offer them and therefore, would benefit from more accessible capital markets. CMU would also make the institutional investments in infrastructures way easier.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Ensuring the stability and the sustainability of the European financial system through integration'''\n\n[[Economic stability]] depends on the diversification of the source of financing. When encountering a [[crisis]] hitting a particular source of financing, such as the banks in 2010, it is important to be able to get capital otherwise, both for the [[State (polity)|states]] and the [[Company|companies]].<ref name=\":8\" />  That is why giving and incentive to get financing through capital markets with the CMU would make the economy more shock-resistant, because it would depend less on the banking system.<ref name=\":5\" /> <ref name=\":12\" /> On the investors side, stability is ensured by the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] and the geographical diversification of the [[Asset|assets]]. It reduces the loss of value if a specific economic area is hit by a negative shock when you have invested in several types of activities and it reduces the loss if a specific country is touched when you have invested in several countries. Hence, the risk-sharing influence of the CMU may strengthen the European economic stability.<ref>Bent E Sorensen and Oved Yosha, \u2018International Risk Sharing and European Monetary Unification\u2019 (1998) 45 Journal of International Economics 211\u201338</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> Regarding [[sustainability]], the increased access to capital is considered as a mean to finance environment-friendly economic projects and to encourage [[sustainable development]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====Strategic objectives====\n\n* '''Improving the competitiveness and the efficiency of the European capital markets, in order to fight against the \"market fatigue\"'''\n\nBy increasing the range of investments opportunities, a CMU objective is to improve the capital markets effectiveness. This means improving the allocation of capital<ref name=\":4\" />, leading it to the most efficient economic actors among the European firms, because a single market for capital would have given the possibility to do so. The efficiency of capital markets deals with the competition between the European [[financial institution]] : making them gather in a common capital market would give the financial institution the incentive to become even more efficient.<ref name=\":10\" /> Competition would also lead to more diversification in terms of [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and assets.<ref name=\":3\" /> Market fatigue is the discredit from which asset and [[Security (finance)|security]] exchanges suffered after the financial crisis. It reduces the capital flow on the capital markets and has a negative impact on the economic activity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2009/10/03/market-fatigue|title=Market fatigue|work=The Economist|access-date=2020-03-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\n* '''Pursuing a stable financial integration, in order to fight against the \"integration fatigue\"'''\n\nThe improved integration of the capital markets with the CMU is meant to increase cross-border risk-sharing and to reduce the home-biais of the investments. Currently, there are still some hindrances, as the differences in terms of regulation among the member-states, which persuade the economic actors to invest in their home-country. Actually, the multiplication of European rules regarding [[insolvency]], restructuration or [[Tax|taxation]] represents a lack of legal security for the investors. <ref name=\":5\" /> As the main point of a single market for capital is to remove the barriers of free capital flow in-between the member-states <ref name=\":3\" />, the objective is to attract the savings of the richer countries towards the poorer ones. Removing the barriers preventing European exchanges, in order to act like a unified territory, is the very sens of integration. It counters the \"integration fatigue\" : the increasing difficulty for the European leaders to pursue the European integration.<ref>Devrim, Deniz, and Evelina Schulz. \"Enlargement fatigue in the European Union: from enlargement to many unions.\" Elcano Newsletter 54 (2009): 26.</ref> It is an incentive to invest abroad, therefore reducing the home-biais. Moreover, investing in another country leads to a geographical diversification of the assets possessed, which has a positive impact on the economic stability, as explained previously.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n* '''Increasing cohesion within the European Union, in order to fight against the \"eroding consensus\"'''\n\nThe \"eroding consensus\" is the increasing difficulty to get the support of the [[European population]] for the European institutions' decisions. The erosion is illustrated by the negative response of France and Netherlands to the European [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|referendum on the constitution of the EU]].<ref>Meyer, Christoph O. \"Asymmetric and asynchronous mediatisation: How public sphere research helps to understand the erosion of the EU\u2019s consensus culture.\" workshop \u2018A European Public Sphere: How much of it do we have and how much do we need. 2005.</ref> The Capital Markets Union's goal is to represent a part of the solution to this issue, by improving the cohesion in Europe. Firstly, it is a project encompassing different [[Currencies of the European Union|currencies]], therefore encompassing countries outside the Eurozone area. Secondly, it involves few changes in the way European institutions work, preventing any opposition to a total overhaul. Finally, it does not require risk-sharing from the member-states, which could have made the population reluctant to the CMU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Its main contribution to the European cohesion is its goal : to equally provide financing on capital markets, across the [[Geography of the European Union|European territory]], and to provide this access on the basis of the economic actors' merit.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n====Operational objectives====\n\n* '''Improving data availability across European countries'''\n\nInvestors on the capital markets don't always have the necessary means to gather the needed information in order to invest, while financing institutions do. However, [[Economics|incertitude]] about there investments may prevent them from investing as much as they could have if they have had the adequate information. The latter would have allowed them to evaluate the worth of an asset and juge if its price corresponds, or not, to its value.<ref name=\":9\" /> Therefore, the first operational objective of the CMU is to increase the information flow to make the price setting on the capital markets more precise.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n* '''Facilitating the access to markets'''\nAs it might be complicated for a small firm to produce the information necessary to enter the capital markets <ref name=\":5\" />, the CMU's purpose is to set up the required execution infrastructures to ease their access. This means reducing the regulatory obstacles stopping SMEs and start-up to finance themselves through capital markets, so that every economic actor could have an equal access to the capital needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> Concretely, it leads to a simplification of the rules regarding the information production for small [[Issuer|issuers]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n* '''Strengthening the implementation of the regulation protecting the investors'''\n\nBecause of the lack of confidence in the [[Financial regulation|regulatory]] structures protecting the investors, the amount of capital invested might be reduced. Consequently, the third operational objective of the CMU is to give more strength to the contracts and the rules protecting the capital providers so that they regain confidence on the capital markets.<ref name=\":3\" /> The idea of the project is that legal certainty that they are no going to loose suddenly the wealth they have invested will encourage the use of capital markets as a good mean to yield a profit from the savings rather than keeping it on a [[bank account]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Actors targeted <ref name=\":3\" />===\nThe Capital Market Union action plan aims at affecting positively 4 types of economic actors :\n\n* '''Citizens : improving the profitability on savings for retirement and the opportunities of investments'''\nIf citizens had the possibility to access capital markets in an easy way, they could use their savings to invest instead of keeping them on their bank account. They would do so because of the wider range of possible investments.<ref name=\":5\" /> It may be more profitable for them and increase the money they have for their retirement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n* '''Companies : extending the possibilities to be financed differently than by a bank loan'''\nFirms, and especially SMEs which still face difficulties entering capital markets, would get access to European capital in an easier way on a single capital market where the information regulation would have been adapted to their situation. This is particularly true for the start-ups experiencing high growth and in need of a quicker financing to sustain their development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Investors : reducing the hindrance to invest in another member state'''\nAs explained previously, the harmonisation of the regulation across the European Union would allow investors to enter other member-state's capital market more easily. In fact, it would reduce their cost of adaptation to the national regulation : the financial regulation of a country would be the one of every member-state. If investing in your home capital market is as simple as investing in another, it would increase the investments opportunities for the investors.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n* '''Banks : extending the lending opportunities and encourage sane balance-sheets'''\n\nBecause risky investments opportunities would go towards capital markets, a bigger portion of the banks' balance-sheets would be dedicated to [[Real economy|the real economy.]]<ref name=\":5\" /> This is a way for the European Commission to prevent the 2010-2011 financial crisis, when the banks's balance-sheets were composed of too many subprime assets, from happening again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tooze, J.

This stagnation might be due to multiple factors, such as the return of growth in the Eurozone countries, reducing the economic incentive to reform its financial system, the rise of political tensions within the EU or the prioritisation of national issues by the European political leaders.<ref name=\":12\" /> Moreover, as the effects of such structural reforms can hardly been observed in the short term, it is difficult to analyse the results of the Capital Markets Union action plan without a bigger time perspective than we have today.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n'''Benefits to the Economy'''\n\nThere is the assumption that developing Capital Markets is important for the economy as it brings along growth and prosperity with diversified sources of investment capital boosting the [[real economy]] in general. The [[Bank for International Settlements]]  outlines that financial markets development accumulates debt and does not improve the real economy and growth as it benefits from high-collateral and low-productivity projects generating misallocation of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cecchetti|first=Stephen|last2=Kharroubi|first2=Enisse|date=2014|title=Why Does Credit Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/work490.pdf|journal=|location=Cambridge, MA|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the growth in debt activities by capital markets before the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 economic crisis]] did not lead to growth in the real economy instead, the increased interaction between banks and market-based activities augmented the probability of [[systemic risk]].<ref>Yongoua Tchikanda, G.

In sum, it creates [[Shadow banking system|shadow banking]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Financing via Capital Markets'''\n\nThe banking sector is recognised to be one of the most important forms of financing for European companies. Nevertheless, the introduction of the [[Basel III]] restricted banking lending and put Capital Markets as an alternative for European business to raise funds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langfield|first=Sam|last2=Pagano|first2=Marco|date=2016|title=Bank bias in Europe: effects on systemic risk and growth|journal=Economic Policy|volume=31|issue=85|pages=51\u2013106|doi=10.1093/epolic/eiv019|issn=0266-4658}}</ref> Captal Markets were seen as an alternative to banks.

All-in-all this limits the scope of the CMU project through the process of de-risking larger banks and relegating SMEs which in turn concentrates the risk in les agile financial actors.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nIn addition, SMEs are not always able to cope with the different standards deriving from European and International law such as for instance, the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), generating extra costs for SMEs and undermining their credibility vis-\u00e0-vis possible investors that look for transparency and guarantees of good management. In practical terms, banks have access to a huge data base where creditworthiness is assessed and then processed. This does not happen on an equal foot for SMEs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php/articles/283-the-role-of-the-capital-markets-union-towards-regulatory-harmonisation-and-supervisory-convergence|title=The role of the Capital Markets Union: towards regulatory harmonisation and supervisory convergence|website=www.on-federalism.eu|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Securitisation'''\n\nThe securitisation process under the CMU project has been highly criticised because of its previous consequences during the 2008 Financial crisis. It is linked to the fact that securitisation-type transactions have led to interconnectedness with the shadow banking system and high levels of risk taking.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32017R2402 Simple, Transparent and Standardised regulation] which should make it easier for investors to assess risk, still lacks  clarity and clear definitions as it paves the way for private entities to interpret it in a broader way undermining its scope.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwarcz|first=Steven L.|date=2001|title=Private Ordering of Public Markets: The Rating Agency Paradox|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.267273|issn=1556-5068}}</ref>\n\n'''European Integration'''\n\nThe idea that Capital Markets integration is an important project to tackle the problem of [[market fragmentation]] in Europe has its contradictions. Unlike the [[Banking union|Banking Union]], the Capital Markets Union project encompasses different member states with different legal backgrounds and does not entail full harmonisation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the ECB, to tackle the problem of market fragmentation, capital markets need equal access to financial services and equal treatment and not just convergence as it will not guarantee financial integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://op.europa.eu:443/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f913783c-3fef-4b2f-9db2-4e10cc637856/language-en|title=Building a capital markets union : Eurosystem contribution to the European Commission's Green Paper.|last=Union|first=Publications Office of the European|date=2015-06-24|website=op.europa.eu|doi=10.2866/815982|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Nonetheless, the project has not managed to deliver this so far and with the UK's exit, it seems unlike that efforts will be made in this field as other financial centres will compete to takes London's place in the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lavery|first=Scott|last2=McDaniel|first2=Sean|last3=Schmid|first3=Davide|date=2019-10-03|title=Finance fragmented?

The then British-appointed Commission, [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Johnathan Hill]] was an active voice in promoting the continuation of the initiative.

The [[Treaty of Rome]], establishing the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957, already expressed the necessity to instaure free movement of capital in between the member states. Then, the directive of 1988 implemented it by preventing any restriction on free capital flow.<ref>B\u00e2ch\u00e9 Jean-Pierre.

According to the [[OECD]] analysis, this is partly due to the fiscal bias : in most European countries, firms benefit from tax advantages if their have to reimburse a bank loan, but that is not the case if they emitted obligations on the capital markets.<ref name=\":9\">\u00ab \u00c9valuation et recommandations \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 13-45.</ref> Therefore, there is a strong financial incentive for European companies to favour the banking sector.

This graph was drawn according to the CMU 2017 [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/staff-working-document-cmu-mid-term-review-june2017_en.pdf mid-term review]]]\nThe European Commission designed 3 different levels of objectives for the Capital Markets Union, from the global economic goals to the more concrete necessity for the construction of an [[Financial integration|integrated financial system]]. These economic objectives frame the six intervention areas encompassed by the action plan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Overarching objectives====\n\n* '''Facilitating the financing of both private and public sector on the financial markets'''\n\nThe Capital Markets Union aims to ease the access of firms and states to financing, which has become more difficult since the financial crisis of 2010-2011. The creation of a single market for capital would send an incentive to [[Private investment fund|private]] and institutional actors to invest the capital available, by creating new possibilities of cross-border attractive investments.<ref name=\":10\" /> This renewed possibility of financing may help the economic agents to come back to the level of growth they had before the crisis, impacting positively the employment rate.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is especially true for SMEs <ref name=\":9\" />which might need more financing than what the banking system can offer them and therefore, would benefit from more accessible capital markets. CMU would also make the institutional investments in infrastructures way easier.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Ensuring the stability and the sustainability of the European financial system through integration'''\n\n[[Economic stability]] depends on the diversification of the source of financing. When encountering a [[crisis]] hitting a particular source of financing, such as the banks in 2010, it is important to be able to get capital otherwise, both for the [[State (polity)|states]] and the [[Company|companies]].<ref name=\":8\" />  That is why giving and incentive to get financing through capital markets with the CMU would make the economy more shock-resistant, because it would depend less on the banking system.<ref name=\":5\" /> <ref name=\":12\" /> On the investors side, stability is ensured by the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] and the geographical diversification of the [[Asset|assets]]. It reduces the loss of value if a specific economic area is hit by a negative shock when you have invested in several types of activities and it reduces the loss if a specific country is touched when you have invested in several countries. Hence, the risk-sharing influence of the CMU may strengthen the European economic stability.<ref>Bent E Sorensen and Oved Yosha, \u2018International Risk Sharing and European Monetary Unification\u2019 (1998) 45 Journal of International Economics 211\u201338</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> Regarding [[sustainability]], the increased access to capital is considered as a mean to finance environment-friendly economic projects and to encourage [[sustainable development]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====Strategic objectives====\n\n* '''Improving the competitiveness and the efficiency of the European capital markets, in order to fight against the \"market fatigue\"'''\n\nBy increasing the range of investments opportunities, a CMU objective is to improve the capital markets effectiveness. This means improving the allocation of capital<ref name=\":4\" />, leading it to the most efficient economic actors among the European firms, because a single market for capital would have given the possibility to do so. The efficiency of capital markets deals with the competition between the European [[financial institution]] : making them gather in a common capital market would give the financial institution the incentive to become even more efficient.<ref name=\":10\" /> Competition would also lead to more diversification in terms of [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and assets.<ref name=\":3\" /> Market fatigue is the discredit from which asset and [[Security (finance)|security]] exchanges suffered after the financial crisis. It reduces the capital flow on the capital markets and has a negative impact on the economic activity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2009/10/03/market-fatigue|title=Market fatigue|work=The Economist|access-date=2020-03-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\n* '''Pursuing a stable financial integration, in order to fight against the \"integration fatigue\"'''\n\nThe improved integration of the capital markets with the CMU is meant to increase cross-border risk-sharing and to reduce the home-biais of the investments. Currently, there are still some hindrances, as the differences in terms of regulation among the member-states, which persuade the economic actors to invest in their home-country. Actually, the multiplication of European rules regarding [[insolvency]], restructuration or [[Tax|taxation]] represents a lack of legal security for the investors. <ref name=\":5\" /> As the main point of a single market for capital is to remove the barriers of free capital flow in-between the member-states <ref name=\":3\" />, the objective is to attract the savings of the richer countries towards the poorer ones. Removing the barriers preventing European exchanges, in order to act like a unified territory, is the very sens of integration. It counters the \"integration fatigue\" : the increasing difficulty for the European leaders to pursue the European integration.<ref>Devrim, Deniz, and Evelina Schulz. \"Enlargement fatigue in the European Union: from enlargement to many unions.\" Elcano Newsletter 54 (2009): 26.</ref> It is an incentive to invest abroad, therefore reducing the home-biais. Moreover, investing in another country leads to a geographical diversification of the assets possessed, which has a positive impact on the economic stability, as explained previously.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n* '''Increasing cohesion within the European Union, in order to fight against the \"eroding consensus\"'''\n\nThe \"eroding consensus\" is the increasing difficulty to get the support of the [[European population]] for the European institutions' decisions. The erosion is illustrated by the negative response of France and Netherlands to the European [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|referendum on the constitution of the EU]].<ref>Meyer, Christoph O. \"Asymmetric and asynchronous mediatisation: How public sphere research helps to understand the erosion of the EU\u2019s consensus culture.\" workshop \u2018A European Public Sphere: How much of it do we have and how much do we need. 2005.</ref> The Capital Markets Union's goal is to represent a part of the solution to this issue, by improving the cohesion in Europe. Firstly, it is a project encompassing different [[Currencies of the European Union|currencies]], therefore encompassing countries outside the Eurozone area. Secondly, it involves few changes in the way European institutions work, preventing any opposition to a total overhaul. Finally, it does not require risk-sharing from the member-states, which could have made the population reluctant to the CMU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Its main contribution to the European cohesion is its goal : to equally provide financing on capital markets, across the [[Geography of the European Union|European territory]], and to provide this access on the basis of the economic actors' merit.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n====Operational objectives====\n\n* '''Improving data availability across European countries'''\n\nInvestors on the capital markets don't always have the necessary means to gather the needed information in order to invest, while financing institutions do. However, [[Economics|incertitude]] about there investments may prevent them from investing as much as they could have if they have had the adequate information. The latter would have allowed them to evaluate the worth of an asset and juge if its price corresponds, or not, to its value.<ref name=\":9\" /> Therefore, the first operational objective of the CMU is to increase the information flow to make the price setting on the capital markets more precise.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n* '''Facilitating the access to markets'''\nAs it might be complicated for a small firm to produce the information necessary to enter the capital markets <ref name=\":5\" />, the CMU's purpose is to set up the required execution infrastructures to ease their access. This means reducing the regulatory obstacles stopping SMEs and start-up to finance themselves through capital markets, so that every economic actor could have an equal access to the capital needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> Concretely, it leads to a simplification of the rules regarding the information production for small [[Issuer|issuers]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n* '''Strengthening the implementation of the regulation protecting the investors'''\n\nBecause of the lack of confidence in the [[Financial regulation|regulatory]] structures protecting the investors, the amount of capital invested might be reduced. Consequently, the third operational objective of the CMU is to give more strength to the contracts and the rules protecting the capital providers so that they regain confidence on the capital markets.<ref name=\":3\" /> The idea of the project is that legal certainty that they are no going to loose suddenly the wealth they have invested will encourage the use of capital markets as a good mean to yield a profit from the savings rather than keeping it on a [[bank account]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Actors targeted <ref name=\":3\" />===\nThe Capital Market Union action plan aims at affecting positively 4 types of economic actors :\n\n* '''Citizens : improving the profitability on savings for retirement and the opportunities of investments'''\nIf citizens had the possibility to access capital markets in an easy way, they could use their savings to invest instead of keeping them on their bank account. They would do so because of the wider range of possible investments.<ref name=\":5\" /> It may be more profitable for them and increase the money they have for their retirement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n* '''Companies : extending the possibilities to be financed differently than by a bank loan'''\nFirms, and especially SMEs which still face difficulties entering capital markets, would get access to European capital in an easier way on a single capital market where the information regulation would have been adapted to their situation. This is particularly true for the start-ups experiencing high growth and in need of a quicker financing to sustain their development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Investors : reducing the hindrance to invest in another member state'''\nAs explained previously, the harmonisation of the regulation across the European Union would allow investors to enter other member-state's capital market more easily. In fact, it would reduce their cost of adaptation to the national regulation : the financial regulation of a country would be the one of every member-state. If investing in your home capital market is as simple as investing in another, it would increase the investments opportunities for the investors.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n* '''Banks : extending the lending opportunities and encourage sane balance-sheets'''\n\nBecause risky investments opportunities would go towards capital markets, a bigger portion of the banks' balance-sheets would be dedicated to [[Real economy|the real economy.]]<ref name=\":5\" /> This is a way for the European Commission to prevent the 2010-2011 financial crisis, when the banks's balance-sheets were composed of too many subprime assets, from happening again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tooze, J.

In sum, it creates [[Shadow banking system|shadow banking]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Financing via Capital Markets'''\n\nThe banking sector is recognised to be one of the most important forms of financing for European companies. Nevertheless, the introduction of the [[Basel III]] restricted banking lending and put Capital Markets as an alternative for European business to raise funds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langfield|first=Sam|last2=Pagano|first2=Marco|date=2016|title=Bank bias in Europe: effects on systemic risk and growth|journal=Economic Policy|volume=31|issue=85|pages=51\u2013106|doi=10.1093/epolic/eiv019|issn=0266-4658}}</ref> Captal Markets were seen as an alternative to banks. However different member states have different levels of financial development some of them, most notably the southern ones, are more likely to be penalised with the project.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Dinov|first=Stanyo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338581120|title=European Capital Markets Union - claims and criticisms|date=2020-01-14|isbn=978-3-643-13883-5}}</ref> The commission had to convince such countryes that the project would be benefitial, nevertheless, the support in the region was somehow limited.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n'''SMEs'''\n\nIn the field of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]], the CMU aims at giving access to [[Venture capital|Venture Capital]] and lowering costs for funding, however it can lead to shorter holding periods of investment and to great volatility.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Gurdgiev|first=Constantin|date=2015|title=Summary of Comments on the European Commission Green Paper 'Building a Capital Markets Union'|journal=|location=Rochester, NY|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2592918|ssrn=2592918}}</ref> It turns out that SMEs are less stable and represent, in general, risky investments, pushing away banks and limiting SMEs clients. All-in-all this limits the scope of the CMU project through the process of de-risking larger banks and relegating SMEs which in turn concentrates the risk in les agile financial actors.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nIn addition, SMEs are not always able to cope with the different standards deriving from European and International law such as for instance, the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), generating extra costs for SMEs and undermining their credibility vis-\u00e0-vis possible investors that look for transparency and guarantees of good management. In practical terms, banks have access to a huge data base where creditworthiness is assessed and then processed. This does not happen on an equal foot for SMEs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php/articles/283-the-role-of-the-capital-markets-union-towards-regulatory-harmonisation-and-supervisory-convergence|title=The role of the Capital Markets Union: towards regulatory harmonisation and supervisory convergence|website=www.on-federalism.eu|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Securitisation'''\n\nThe securitisation process under the CMU project has been highly criticised because of its previous consequences during the 2008 Financial crisis. It is linked to the fact that securitisation-type transactions have led to interconnectedness with the shadow banking system and high levels of risk taking.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32017R2402 Simple, Transparent and Standardised regulation] which should make it easier for investors to assess risk, still lacks  clarity and clear definitions as it paves the way for private entities to interpret it in a broader way undermining its scope.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwarcz|first=Steven L.|date=2001|title=Private Ordering of Public Markets: The Rating Agency Paradox|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.267273|issn=1556-5068}}</ref>\n\n'''European Integration'''\n\nThe idea that Capital Markets integration is an important project to tackle the problem of [[market fragmentation]] in Europe has its contradictions. Unlike the [[Banking union|Banking Union]], the Capital Markets Union project encompasses different member states with different legal backgrounds and does not entail full harmonisation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the ECB, to tackle the problem of market fragmentation, capital markets need equal access to financial services and equal treatment and not just convergence as it will not guarantee financial integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://op.europa.eu:443/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f913783c-3fef-4b2f-9db2-4e10cc637856/language-en|title=Building a capital markets union : Eurosystem contribution to the European Commission's Green Paper.|last=Union|first=Publications Office of the European|date=2015-06-24|website=op.europa.eu|doi=10.2866/815982|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Nonetheless, the project has not managed to deliver this so far and with the UK's exit, it seems unlike that efforts will be made in this field as other financial centres will compete to takes London's place in the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lavery|first=Scott|last2=McDaniel|first2=Sean|last3=Schmid|first3=Davide|date=2019-10-03|title=Finance fragmented?

The then British-appointed Commission, [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Johnathan Hill]] was an active voice in promoting the continuation of the initiative. The Brexit decision was shocking for many as it meant that the CMU would see its efforts to build a risk-sharing via liquidity [[Derivatives market|derivatives]] and [[Capital market|securities markets]] very limited.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busch|first=Danny|date=2017-09-01|title=A Capital Markets Union for a Divided Europe|url=https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article/3/2/262/3897098|journal=Journal of Financial Regulation|volume=3|issue=2|pages=262\u2013279|doi=10.1093/jfr/fjx002|issn=2053-4833}}</ref>\n\nThe initial aim of the project was to get closer to UK by repairing the ties with the EU27 as it would include all member states attracting and benefiting [[City of London|the City]] at the same time.<ref>Djankov, S, (2016). \u02bbLong-Term Impacts on Brexit\u02bc  PIIE \u02c2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0MyjPP5m8<nowiki />\u02c3</ref> In practice, it will also mean that the EU will lose the UK's wholesale market rendering the project somehow \"meaningless\" as this incentive along with the UK's proactive role diminished the project's publicization as from Brexit and lost support from some [[Member state of the European Union|member states.]]<ref name=\":1\" />\n== See also ==\n* [[List of European stock exchanges|List of European Stock Exchanges]]\n* [[List of currencies in Europe|List of Currencies in Europe]]\n* [[Banking union|Banking Union]]\n* [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]\n* [[European Central Bank]]\n* [[European Investment Bank]]\n* [[European Banking Authority]]\n* [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]\n* [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}<br />\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Euro topics}}\n{{European Union topics}}\n{{Portal bar|European Union|Economics}}\n\n[[Category:Finance]]\n[[Category:European Union]]\n[[Category:Eurozone]]\n[[Category:Economy of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Eurogroup]]\n[[Category:Euro]]\n", "name_user": "JoaoPillon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAction plan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Markets_Union"}

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh.

Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon. The final mission undertaken by ADGs in Vietnam was to provide security for the evacuation.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.597</ref> The \"last\" evacuation aircraft was severely overloaded and four ADGs were left on the tarmac at [[Tan Son Nhut]] airfield, each armed with a pistol and four rounds of ammunition; a C-130 was diverted from Thailand to evacuate them later in the day.<ref>[[#refHam2007|Ham 2007]], p.601.</ref> Over 350 ADGs served in Vietnam,<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> six being killed in the conflict.<ref>[[#refADGAssoc|Airfield Defence Guard Association website]] Accessed on 8 July 2008</ref> In addition to the MM awarded to Powers, GRDEFOs and ADGs were awarded an [[MBE]], eight [[mention in dispatches|mentions in dispatches]] and four [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s of the ten awarded to RAAF members.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], pp.242\u2013243.</ref>\n\n===1972\u20131999===\nAfter withdrawal from Vietnam the ADG mustering was reduced in numbers, with Rifle Flights posted to RAAF Bases Amberley, Fairbairn, Richmond and Williamtown and ADGs manning instructional posts at other establishments.<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.32.</ref>\nAlthough the RAAF contemplated disbanding the mustering in the mid-1980s, the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 deployment to East Timor were spent consolidating tactics and techniques such as reconnaissance skills and Quick Reaction Force (QRF) operations. 2AFDS was reformed on 17 March 1983<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.1634</ref> with the headquarters located at RAAF Base Richmond and the Rifle Flights remaining dispersed; the unit was eventually consolidated at RAAF Base Amberley in January 1989. It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]].

Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases.

It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

The additional manpower also allowed the squadron to assume responsibility for the Dili heliport in December.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.94.</ref>\n\n2AFDS was awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation and the Commanding Officer, Squadron Leader J.D. Leo, received the Distinguished Service Medal for performance during [[Operation Warden]].<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.133.</ref>\n\n===Solomon Islands===\nADGs and GRDEFOs deployed to Henderson Field, Honiara as part of the RAAF component of Joint Task Force 635 on [[Operation Anode]], the ADF contribution to the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI)]]. Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

ADGs continue to be deployed to the [[Middle East Area of Operations]] (MEAO) in small numbers to provide specialist support to operations.\n\n===Other operations===\nIn addition to the major campaigns listed above, in recent years ADGs have been involved in a range of smaller scale operations. These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

The station opened on 1 July 1856, is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\nIn 1888 the station building from [[K\u00f6ln]]-Kalk was transferred to Sterkrade.<ref>Lindemann p.25</ref> This building was badly damaged during the Second World War, so that a new building had to be erected. This was opened in 1952.<ref>Lindemann p.56</ref> It is currently owned by a private investor.\n\n== Location and layout ==\nOberhausen-Sterkrade station is on the [[Duisburg-Ruhrort\u2013Dortmund railway]] (line 2206, [[Wanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Oberhausen-Sterkrade) and the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] (line 2270, [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Emmerich border \u2013 [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]]). The neighbouring stations to the south are Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof (line 2270) and [[Oberhausen-Osterfeld station|Oberhausen-Osterfeld]] (line 2206), while [[Oberhausen-Holten station]] is the next station to the north.\n \nThe station has six mainline tracks that run approximately in a south-north direction. Platform track 1 (to Emmerich) and 2 (from Emmerich) are the continuous mainline platform tracks. Track 3 serves as a passing track. Track 4 is used for traffic to the Oxea factory. Tracks 8 and 9 on the east side are used for parking trains, while a former siding to the GHH wheelset factory is no longer used. The entrance building is located east of platform&nbsp;1. The station is equipped with a platform next to the station building on track&nbsp;1 (172&nbsp;metres long) and an island platform between tracks&nbsp;2 and 3 (222&nbsp;metres long).

The station opened on 1 July 1856, is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\nIn 1888 the station building from [[K\u00f6ln]]-Kalk was transferred to Sterkrade.<ref>Lindemann p.25</ref> This building was badly damaged during the Second World War, so that a new building had to be erected. This was opened in 1952.<ref>Lindemann p.56</ref> It is currently owned by a private investor.\n\n== Location and layout ==\nOberhausen-Sterkrade station is on the [[Duisburg-Ruhrort\u2013Dortmund railway]] (line 2206, [[Wanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Oberhausen-Sterkrade) and the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] (line 2270, [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Emmerich border \u2013 [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]]). The neighbouring stations to the south are Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof (line 2270) and [[Oberhausen-Osterfeld station|Oberhausen-Osterfeld]] (line 2206), while [[Oberhausen-Holten station]] is the next station to the north.\n \nThe station has six mainline tracks that run approximately in a south-north direction. Platform track 1 (to Emmerich) and 2 (from Emmerich) are the continuous mainline platform tracks. Track 3 serves as a passing track. Track 4 is used for traffic to the Oxea factory. Tracks 8 and 9 on the east side are used for parking trains, while a former siding to the GHH wheelset factory is no longer used. The entrance building is located east of platform&nbsp;1. The station is equipped with a platform next to the station building on track&nbsp;1 (172&nbsp;metres long) and an island platform between tracks&nbsp;2 and 3 (222&nbsp;metres long). The platforms are 38&nbsp;centimetres high with the exception of a short, raised area on platform&nbsp;1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |title=Bahnsteiginformationen, Station Oberhausen-Sterkrade |publisher=Deutsche Bahn AG |date=23 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223209/http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2020|language=de}}</ref> Within the station precinct, Rosastra\u00dfe crosses the tracks to the south over a level crossing.\n \nThe station has two exits: the western one leads to the park-and-ride car park on ''Neum\u00fchler Stra\u00dfe'' in the Schwarze Heide district and the eastern one leads directly to the centre of Sterkrad.
