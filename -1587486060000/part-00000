The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the [[radius]]. This article is about circles in [[Euclidean geometry]], and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.\n\nSpecifically, a circle is a [[Simple polygon|simple]] closed [[curve]] that divides the plane into two [[Region (mathematics)|regions]]: an [[interior (topology)|interior]] and an [[exterior]]. In everyday use, the term \"circle\" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]].\n\nA circle may also be defined as a special kind of [[ellipse]] in which the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] are coincident and the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is 0, or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using [[calculus of variations]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}{{Clear}}<!--To avoid layout breaking when TOC is hidden-->\n\n==Euclid's definition==\n{{quotation|A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal.

Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle.\n* [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]: the point equidistant from all points on the circle.\n* [[Chord (geometry)|Chord]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments.\n* [[Circumference]]: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.\n* [[Diameter]]: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius.\n* [[Disk (mathematics)|Disc]]: the region of the plane bounded by a circle.\n* [[Lens (geometry)|Lens]]: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs.\n* Passant: a [[coplanar]] straight line that has no point in common with the circle.\n* [[Radius]]: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter.\n* [[Circular sector|Sector]]: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common center and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this center and the endpoints of the radii.\n* [[Circular segment|Segment]]: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term ''segment'' is used only for regions not containing the center of the circle to which their arc belongs to.\n* [[Secant line|Secant]]: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points.\n* [[Semicircle]]: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as center. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the  two dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-[[Disk (mathematics)|disc]]. A half-disc is a special case of a [[Circular segment|segment]], namely the largest one.\n* [[Tangent]]: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\").\nAll of the specified regions may be considered as ''open'', that is, not containing their boundaries, or as ''closed'', including their respective boundaries.\n{{Clear}}\n{| style=\"float:left;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n|[[Image:CIRCLE LINES.svg|right|thumb|Chord, secant, tangent, radius, and diameter]]\n|[[Image:Circle slices.svg|right|thumb|Arc, sector, and segment]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\nThe [[compass (drafting)|compass]] in this 13th-century manuscript is a symbol of God's act of [[Creation myth|Creation]].

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\n'''Parametric form '''<br>\nThe equation can be written in [[parametric equation|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as\n:<math>x = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,</math>\nwhere ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]] in the range 0 to 2{{pi}}, interpreted geometrically as the [[angle]] that the ray from (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n:<math>x = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,</math>\n\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of ''t'' to ''r'' can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the line passing through the centre parallel to the ''x''-axis (see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]). However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;\u2212''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''\u03c6'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2013 ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n* All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n** A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n** Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n* The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n** The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n** For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n* If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n*If one chords intersect other at an angle '''\u03b8''', and divide it into '''x''' and '''y''' and it self into '''w''' and '''z''', the the radius of the circle is given by the following expression: ''4R\u00b2sin\u00b2\u03b8=(x-y)\u00b2+(w-z)\u00b2+4xysin\u00b2\u03b8+2(x-y)(w-z)cos\u03b8.''

(Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n* {{anchor|Tangent-secant theorem}}A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident.

(Tangent-secant theorem.)\n* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''\u2113'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n* {{anchor|Secant-secant theorem}}If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (<math>\\overset{\\frown}{DE}</math> and <math>\\overset{\\frown}{BC}</math>).

Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n* The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n* Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle.

Stanley Ogilvy|Ogilvy, C. Stanley]], ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14\u201317.</ref> (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment ''AB'', a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Inscription in or circumscription about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle \u2013 from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

Retrieved on 2012-05-03.</ref> Every [[regular polygon]] and every triangle is a tangential polygon.\n\nA [[cyclic polygon]] is any convex polygon about which a [[circumcircle|circle can be circumscribed]], passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n* A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n* A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n* A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n* A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==In other ''p''-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm|''p''-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|squares]] with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>\u221e</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>\u221e</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n{{main|Squaring the circle}}\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==Significance in art and symbolism==\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist\u2019s message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle\u2019s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth. <ref>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charnier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J9PNwQEACAAJ&dq=the+louvre+abu+dhabi+a+world+vision+of+art&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVucfTpqHmAhWNwqYKHeSBBcMQ6AEwAXoECAMQAgl \"The Circle from East to West\"], ''The Louvre Abu Dhabi: A World Vision of Art'', October 29, 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Affine sphere]]\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n* [[Apeirogon]]\n* [[Circle fitting]]\n* [[List of circle topics]]\n* [[Sphere]]\n* [[Three points determine a circle]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n* [[Unit circle]]\n* [[Apollonian circles]]\n* [[Chromatic circle]]\n* [[Ford circle]]\n* [[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n* [[Carlyle circle]]\n* [[Bankoff circle]]\n* [[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n* [[Archimedean circle]]\n* [[Johnson circles]]\n* [[Schoch circles]]\n* [[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n* [[Mandart circle]]\n* [[Spieker circle]]\n* [[Nine-point circle]]\n* [[Lemoine circle]]\n* [[Circumcircle]]\n* [[Incircle]]\n* [[Excircle]]\n* [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n* [[Lester circle]]\n* [[Malfatti circles]]\n* [[Brocard circle]]\n* [[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n* [[Van Lamoen circle]]\n* [[Parry circle]]\n* [[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n* [[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n* [[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n* [[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n* [[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n* [[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n* [[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n* [[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html   | title = Interactive Java applets | quote = for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php  | title = Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle | quote = Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml  | title = Munching on Circles | quote =  [[cut-the-knot]]}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Simple curve of Euclidean geometry}}\n{{About|the shape and mathematical concept}}\n{{redirect2|360 degrees|360\u00b0}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}{{Infobox polygon\n|name       = Circle\n|image      = Circle-withsegments.svg\n|caption    = A circle (black), which is measured by its circumference (''C''), diameter (''D'') in cyan, and radius (''R'') in red; its centre (''O'') is in magenta.\n}}\n\nA '''circle''' is a [[shape]] consisting of all [[point (geometry)|points]] in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] that are a given distance from a given point, the<!-- This article is written using British English \u2013 see WP:ENGVAR, Wikipedia articles should remain with the original variant 'center' is the American English spelling --> [[Centre (geometry)|centre]];<!--see comment before about 'center'--> equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]].

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\n'''Parametric form '''<br>\nThe equation can be written in [[parametric equation|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as\n:<math>x = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,</math>\nwhere ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]] in the range 0 to 2{{pi}}, interpreted geometrically as the [[angle]] that the ray from (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n:<math>x = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,</math>\n\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of ''t'' to ''r'' can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the line passing through the centre parallel to the ''x''-axis (see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]). However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the leftmost point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;\u2212''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''\u03c6'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2013 ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n* The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n* The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n* All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n** A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n** The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n* The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n** Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n* Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n* Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n* The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n** A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n** The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n* If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n* If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n** For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n* An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n* The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n** Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n* If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n* If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n* The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r'' <sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p'' <sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n* The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.<ref>Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.71}}\n\n===Tangent===\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n* A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n* Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n* If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point ''P'', then denoting the centre as ''O'', the angles \u2220''BOA'' and \u2220''BPA'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n* If ''AD'' is tangent to the circle at ''A'' and if ''AQ'' is a chord of the circle, then {{nowrap|\u2220''DAQ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}arc(''AQ'')}}.\n\n===Theorems===\n[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]\n{{See also|Power of a point}}\n* The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}.\n* If two secants, ''AE'' and ''AD'', also cut the circle at ''B'' and ''C'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}. (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n* {{anchor|Tangent-secant theorem}}A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a [[tangent]] from an external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''F'' and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''C'' and ''D'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AF''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD''}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n* The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n* If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''\u2113'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n* {{anchor|Secant-secant theorem}}If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (<math>\\overset{\\frown}{DE}</math> and <math>\\overset{\\frown}{BC}</math>). That is, <math>2\\angle{CAB}= \\angle{DOE} - \\angle{BOC}</math> where ''O'' is the centre of the circle. (Secant-secant theorem.)\n\n===Inscribed angles===\n{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}\n[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]\nAn [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n* The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n* Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n=== Construction with given diameter ===\n* Construct the [[midpoint (geometry)|midpoint]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre {{math|'''M'''}} passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n[[File:Circunferencia 10.svg|thumb|Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue).

That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Inscription in or circumscription about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle \u2013 from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n* A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n* A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n* A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n* A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==In other ''p''-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm|''p''-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|squares]] with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>\u221e</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>\u221e</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n{{main|Squaring the circle}}\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==Significance in art and symbolism==\nFrom the time of the earliest known civilisations \u2013 such as the Assyrians and ancient Egyptians, those in the Indus Valley and along the Yellow River in China, and the Western civilisations of ancient Greece and Rome during classical Antiquity \u2013 the circle has been used directly or indirectly in visual art to convey the artist\u2019s message and to express certain ideas.\nHowever, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists\u2019 perceptions. While some emphasised the circle\u2019s perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits.\nThe circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth. <ref>Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Charnier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=J9PNwQEACAAJ&dq=the+louvre+abu+dhabi+a+world+vision+of+art&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjVucfTpqHmAhWNwqYKHeSBBcMQ6AEwAXoECAMQAgl \"The Circle from East to West\"], ''The Louvre Abu Dhabi: A World Vision of Art'', October 29, 2019</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Affine sphere]]\n* [[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n* [[Apeirogon]]\n* [[Circle fitting]]\n* [[List of circle topics]]\n* [[Sphere]]\n* [[Three points determine a circle]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n* [[Unit circle]]\n* [[Apollonian circles]]\n* [[Chromatic circle]]\n* [[Ford circle]]\n* [[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n* [[Carlyle circle]]\n* [[Bankoff circle]]\n* [[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n* [[Archimedean circle]]\n* [[Johnson circles]]\n* [[Schoch circles]]\n* [[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n* [[Mandart circle]]\n* [[Spieker circle]]\n* [[Nine-point circle]]\n* [[Lemoine circle]]\n* [[Circumcircle]]\n* [[Incircle]]\n* [[Excircle]]\n* [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n* [[Lester circle]]\n* [[Malfatti circles]]\n* [[Brocard circle]]\n* [[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n* [[Van Lamoen circle]]\n* [[Parry circle]]\n* [[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n* [[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n* [[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n* [[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n* [[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n* [[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n* [[Director circle]]\n* [[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n* [[Great circle]]\n* [[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n* [[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n* [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n* [[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html   | title = Interactive Java applets | quote = for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php  | title = Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle | quote = Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action}}\n* {{cite web| url = http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml  | title = Munching on Circles | quote =  [[cut-the-knot]]}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]\n", "name_user": "Swaroopdora", "label": "safe", "comment": "I have added a formula that I have found on Chord Theorem of circle.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle"}

{"title_page": "List of fictional United States presidencies of historical figures (V\u2013Z)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup|reason=Too much detail; needs to be resectioned by person|date=November 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n{{FictionalPotus}}\nThe following is a list of real or historical people who have been portrayed as [[President of the United States]] in fiction, although they did not hold the office in real life. This is done either as an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual US Presidents with a fictional presidency at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n==V==\n===[[Martin Van Buren]]===\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga]]'' by the business historian [[Robert Sobel]], '''Martin Van Buren''' was the leader of the Northern Confederation's Conservative Party in the 1820s and the 1830s and was the Governor of the Northern Confederation from 1825 to 1831. Unlike the Northern Confederation's Liberal Party, the Conservatives were poorly organized and had no basic political philosophy. Instead, they simply opposed Liberal policies. The Conservatives did have more popular support than the Liberals and they were able to gain a majority of seats on the Northern Confederation Council in the 1825 elections and Van Buren became governor. The Conservatives' manipulation of the banking system led to the Depression of 1829, which cost them their majority in the 1831 elections.\n\n===[[Clement Vallandigham]]===\n* In the alternate history novel \"By Force of Arms\" by Billy Bennett, '''Clement Vallandigham''' was elected President of the United States in the aftermath of the U.S. defeat in the [[American Civil War]]. His policy was one of appeasement towards the [[Confederate States of America]] in the hope of luring them back into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] by diplomacy. His strategy was a disaster in that [[Jefferson Davis]] took advantage of Vallandigham's perceived weakness by invading and annexing the southern half of the disputed [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]]/[[New Mexico Territory]]. In the aftermath Vallandigham was defeated in the next Presidential election by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n* Similar to the above, in [[Ward Moore]]'s novel \"[[Bring the Jubilee]]\", the Confederacy wins the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], wins its independence and imposes a humiliating peace on the rump United States, whereupon  '''Clement Vallandigham''' wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] with the electorate turning sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. However, Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and galloping inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham  partially responsible.\n\n* In ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]], the invention of a functional [[analytical engine]] by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1824 results in the early arrival of the [[Information Age]] and the ascendancy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as a [[world power]]. British interference in North America in order to prevent the rise of the United States as a global power results in its fragmentation into a rump United States, the Confederate States, the [[Republic of Texas|Texan Republic]], the [[Californian Republic]], the [[Manhattan]] Commune and a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-dominated 'terra nullius'. In 1855, '''Clement Vallandigham''' is mentioned as being the former Union president (meaning that he had to have left office by 1853 at the latest) and acting as an uninhibited drunkard during a private dinner in [[London]].\n\n===[[Arthur H. Vandenberg]]===\n* '''Arthur Vandenberg''' was president from 1941 to 1945 in the 1939 [[Robert A. Heinlein]] novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]''.\n\n===[[Jesse Ventura]]===\n* '''Jesse Ventura''' is shown fighting for re-election against [[Henry Kissinger]] in ''[[Killroy and Tina]]''.\n* He is seen in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episodes \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\" and \"[[All the Presidents' Heads]]\" in the Hall of Presidents in the New New York Head Museum, implying that he served as President of either the United States or of Earth before the year 3000.\n\n===[[Kurt Vonnegut]]===\n* '''Kurt Vonnegut''' is president of the United Socialist States of America in [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]]'s ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', serving as a parallel to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n==W==\n===[[George Wallace]]===\n* In Mona Clee's ''Branch Point'' (1996), '''George Wallace''' is elected president (with [[Curtis LeMay]] as his vice president) in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] after the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinations]] of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. In another alternate timeline in the same novel, '''George Wallace''' is elected as the 43rd President in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], succeeding [[Bill Clinton]]. The novel was published in January 1996, indicating that the author may have believed that Clinton would lose the 1996 election.\n* He served one term (1977\u20131981) in the 1975 movie ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnelvision]]'', and was succeeded by an African-American woman named Washington.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[11/22/63]]'' by [[Stephen King]], '''George Wallace''' was elected president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. His predecessor was [[John F. Kennedy]]. Wallace escalated the [[Vietnam War]] into a [[nuclear war]] that precipitated numerous other atomic conflicts around the globe. The state of [[Maine]] seceded from the United States and was a [[Canada|Canadian]] province by 2011. On May 15, 1972, Wallace was assassinated by [[Arthur Bremer]]. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Curtis LeMay]], who was defeated by his Democratic opponent Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]].\n\n===[[Henry A. Wallace]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"News from the Front\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Henry Wallace''' was serving as vice president under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the time of the United States' entry into [[World War II]] on December 11, 1941, as he was in real life. From then onwards, Roosevelt faced harsh criticism from and strict scrutiny by the American press. The press attacked the Roosevelt administration for not being prepared for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, as well as bringing on the attack by ignorantly imposing an oil embargo on the [[Empire of Japan]]. As the war progressed, the press began to constantly second-guess the Roosevelt administration and to ponder the value of the war. Furthermore, the press revealed important American military secrets, questioning the morality of spying on the [[Axis powers]], decrying the poor state of American technology and giving away planned attacks days before there were to take place, leading to their failures. More importantly, the [[Battle of Midway]] (June 4\u20137, 1942) proved to be a complete disaster. During the first half of 1942, protests against the war began to appear throughout the country and a group of celebrities took it upon themselves to sale to Japan and [[Nazi Germany]] to offer peace. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] faced similar problems in his own country. Matters came to a head when Vice President Wallace broke with the administration and publicly attacked Roosevelt's honesty and competence. Calls for [[impeachment]] grew louder throughout the United States and, finally, Congress began the impeachment process in June 1942. Although the story ends while Roosevelt is still president, it is heavily implied that he will be [[Impeachment in the United States#Impeachment of a U.S. President|impeached]] and removed from office and that Wallace will succeed him as the 33rd President.\n* The [[GURPS Infinite Worlds]] game include the timeline known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Lenin-1|Lenin-1]]'' in which Roosevelt maintained  Wallace as his vice president when he was reelected in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]; consequently '''Henry Wallace''' became president on April 12, 1945, upon Roosevelt's death. His passive stance (and that of his successors) against the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in the steady expansion of [[Communism]] across the globe. By 1989, the isolated and malaise-stricken United States is essentially the sole remaining [[capitalism|capitalist]] country on the planet. Also resulting from Wallace becoming president in 1945 is the \"Hell World\" known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Hell Worlds|Lenin-2]]'' where nuclear war and unconstrained industry have combined to crash the [[biosphere]].\n* Wallace also played an unfortunate role in the history of another unpleasant [[GURPS Infinite Worlds|GURPS]] timeline, known as [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Reich-5|Reich-5]]. In this timeline [[Giuseppe Zangara]] succeeded in assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1933. He was followed by [[John Nance Garner|Garner]], [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh]] and then '''Henry Wallace''', who all proved unable to handle the [[Great Depression]] - finally leading to the far-right [[William Dudley Pelley]] being elected president in [[1948 United States presidential election|1944]], assuming dictatorial powers, and inviting the Nazis to conquer the US to help him against the pro-democracy resistance - ending with a totally Nazi-dominated world.\n* '''Wallace''' becomes president after World War II in the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' strip ''Hope:... for the Future'' by [[Guy Adams]], set in a [[film noir]] world where magic is real.\n\n===[[Earl Warren]]===\n* In the [[Colonization (series)|''Colonization'' series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Earl Warren''' served as President of the United States from 1961 to 1965. He was elected president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and would be re-elected in a landslide over his Democratic opponent [[Hubert Humphrey]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He was in office when the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s Colonization Fleet arrived at Earth in 1962 and ordered a secret attack using [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]] fired from a [[artificial satellite|satellite]] that destroyed a dozen of the Fleet's starships. President Warren concealed his role in the affair for several years but the information was ultimately leaked to the Race in 1965 by Sam Yeager through Shiplord Straha, despite Warren's best efforts to silence Yeager through draconian extralegal measures. Fleetlord Atvar threatened war with the United States. Having seen how quickly and easily the Race had defeated Germany in the short-lived Race-German of 1965, President Warren knew he must avoid a war at all costs. Atvar offered two other options: abandon all space exploration for the indefinite future or allow the Race to destroy an American city. Warren knew he that must choose one of the two lest his country be destroyed and he would not give up the space program, a sign of his country's might and technological prowess. Consequently, he surprised and disappointed Atvar by allowing him to destroy [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Warren then committed suicide in the Gray House, the presidential residence in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and was succeeded by his vice president, [[Harold Stassen]].\n\n===[[George Washington]]===\n* In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the short story \"[[He Walked Around the Horses]]\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], '''General George Washington''' was killed in the [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Battle of Doylestown]] during the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] of the colonies in [[British North America]] in the 1770s. He died in the arms of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence and that Washington survived.\n* In the short story \"The Father of His Country\" by [[Jody Lynn Nye]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''George Washington''' ran against [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the [[1788-89 United States presidential election|first United States presidential election in 1789]]. In spite of the fact that Franklin was 83&nbsp;years old and was rumored to have fathered numerous illegitimate children while serving as [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]] from 1778 to 1785, he was elected by the [[1st United States Congress]] on April 6, 1789, in part due to reservations voiced by prominent members of Congress such as [[John Hancock]] and [[Charles Thomson]] regarding Washington. They were concerned that it would set a bad precedent for the first President to be a general. Furthermore, Franklin's supporters stressed that he was well liked and respected by foreign heads of state friendly to the United States, had been prominent in matters of diplomacy and government at home and abroad and had already proven that he had the best interests of the nation at heart. Franklin was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1789. Franklin's vice president was [[John Adams]] who had supported Washington in Congress, as had his second cousin [[Samuel Adams]]. During his tenure in office, President Franklin attempted to create a more democratic society and managed to live longer than he did in real life, serving until at least 1792.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Colonel George Washington''' was part of a group of American colonists who met with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]] in the 1760s and were able to put in place an eleventh hour agreement with avoided [[American Revolution|revolution]]. Washington and the King were immortalized in a painting entitled ''The Two Georges'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], which came to symbolize the friendship between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[North American Union]]. In his later career as the [[Governor-general]] of the North American Union, Washington implemented a policy which halted the westward expansion of European settlement for some decades and gave a chance to certain [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes such as the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Cherokee]] to modernize and keep much of their lands. For that reasons, he greatly revered by Native Americans into the late 20th century. The Iroquois believed that he was the only white person to be admitted to their religion's version of [[Paradise]]. Conversely, he is considered a traitor by the nativist, separatist organization, the [[Sons of Liberty]]. He is also the namesake of the Province of Washington (analogous with Saskatchewan) and an NAU car marque.\n* In the short story \"Arnoldstown\" by [[Mitchell Cummings]], '''General George Washington''' died of [[pneumonia]] during the winter of 1777\u20131778, which led to the near disintegration of the [[Continental Army]]. [[Benedict Arnold]] eventually succeeded him as its commanding general, rebuilt the army and snatched victory from the jaws of near-certain defeat. After independence had been secured through the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), Arnold went on to be elected as the first President of the United States in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]]. He was the most revered of all the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in later generations. The story's name is derived from the US capital in this timeline being [[Washington, D.C.|Arnoldstown, D.C.]] with his name also being commemorated in the state of [[Washington (state)|Arnoldia]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] and numerous other place-names.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''George Washington''' served as the first President from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797, as he was in real life. After the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862), U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as the most memorable of presidents, though only Roosevelt was viewed in an entirely positive light. As a young man, Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader. However, the general public did not always remembered kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the US suffered because of it \u2013 as did that of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the US occupation authorities in [[Canada]]). Nonetheless, the US rebuilt the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). The Confederates were themselves saddened of the monument being destroyed in the war as well, as they were fond of George Washington, too. In fact, before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]. The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under Anthony Dresser, used Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan, \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first and President of the United States second. [[Washington and Lee University|Washington University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[nuclear weapon|superbomb]], retained its name and the statue of Washington that stood in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] survived both Great Wars.\n* In [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]]'s [[novella]] ''[[The Forest of Time]]'', in the late 1780's General '''George Washington''' took a personal interest in the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee Wars]] - i.e. the violent conflict between Pennamites from [[Pennsilvania]] and Yankees from [[Connecticut]], both of whom laid claim to the [[Wyoming Valley]] and sent rival groups of settlers to it. In a fatally misguided step, Washington placed a unit of the Virginia Militia, commanded by himself, as a neutral buffer between Pennamites and Yankees. This culminated with the Virginians being trapped and decimated in a crossfire, Washington himself being among those killed. When the news of  Washington's death reached [[Philadelphia]], where the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was just convening, [[Benjamin Franklin]] suffered a stroke and died, too. The convention broke up in consternation, and the [[Constitution of the United States]] was never adopted and a Federal Government never created. The loose structure of the [[Continental Congress]] eventually disintegrated, with the Thirteen Colonies going each its own way as full-fledged nation states - except that the Yankees of [[New England]] did create their own more narrow confederation. In this situation, Yankee settlers - backed by the rest of New England - held on to much of the Wyoming Valley, their conflict with Pennsilvania further escalating. Eventually, two mutually hostile nation states emerged, possessing fully equipped regular armies - hereditary enemies which habitually and repeatedly go to war with each other. Posterity remembered George Washington as a talented general who won what was remembered as ''The War Against the British''. However, that war itself was remembered only as a temporary and ephemeral alliance, whose participants later often went to war with each other. Washington having been a Virginian, most people in North America thought of him as a foreigner and people in Virginia's neighbors thought of him as having been from an enemy country. \n* In the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] novel [[The Probability Broach]] by [[L. Neil Smith]], the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] succeeds after [[Albert Gallatin]] intercedes to help the farmers rather than the fledgling United States government as he does in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a [[Second American Revolution]]. This eventually leads to the overthrowing and execution of '''George Washington''' by firing squad for [[treason]] in 1794 and the United States Government being reformed. This included the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] being declared null and void, a new caretaker government being organized with all taxes being repelled in 1795, and the [[Articles of Confederation]] being revised with a much emphasis on individual freedom in 1797. After the war, Gallatin would serve as the 2nd and 7th president from 1794 to 1812 and from 1836 to 1840 with his actions later starting a [[libertarian]] state known as the [[North American Confederacy]] in 1893. Despite this, Gallatin insisted that historians would still count George Washington as the first president.\n* In the novel ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], in which the United States lost the American Revolution, '''Washington''' was executed for treason. America remained under control of the [[British Empire]] well into the 20th century. Washington's descendant, a gifted engineer still living in the ancestral [[Mount Vernon]], undertakes the stupendous project of a tunnel under the Atlantic which would bind America closer than ever to Britain.\n* In the alternate history series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], '''George Washington''' is mentioned as \"Lord Potomac\", who served under the English crown during the alternate version of the [[American Revolution]]. However, he surrendered his army and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] for treason.\n* In the story \"Paine's Paine\" by Margaret Klein, conspirators led by the turncoat [[Thomas Hickey (soldier)|Thomas Hickey]] managing to kidnap '''George Washington''' in 1776 and deliver him to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]. Transported by a British warship, Washington was taken to the [[Tower of London]], to await trial on charges of [[High treason]]. However, the revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] secretly traveled to [[England]] and with the help of British radicals effected a dramatic prison break. Paine and the freed Washington boarded a ship captained by [[John Paul Jones]], which eluded the [[Royal Navy]] and arrived triumphantly at [[Boston]]. Paine was venerated as a hero and appointed as Washington's second in command. Throughout the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the two of them together led the American forces. There was, however, a fundamental difference between  Washington's conservatism and Paine's radical ideas, which came into the open once independence was achieved. Eventually, Washington and Paine became bitter political foes. Following the first presidential election in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]], Washington was elected President and Paine - Vice President, but there was increasing friction between them which culminated in a violent clash in August 1790. Washington was killed by a militia supporting Paine. He himself denied responsibility and expressed \"great regret\" at Washington's death. In the aftermath, Paine assumed the Presidency but was regarded as an illegal usurper by a considerable part of the American public and initially sought to mollify his opponents and reach a compromise, but in vain. After surviving three assassination attempts and facing several armed insurrections, Paine saw no alternative but resorting to increasingly harsh measures against his opponents. These tarnished his reputation and earned him the nickname \"The American [[Robespierre]]\". In the face of mounting opposition, Paine tried to rally his followers, including radical intellectuals and working-class crowds, around a program of thorough social and political reform. He had some successes but was assassinated in November 1792, after issuing a Proclamation for Emancipation of the Slaves which he did not live to implement. After Paine's death, there was a sharp conservative backlash, Paine's main supporters being arrested or fleeing to exile in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[French First Republic|France]]. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], recalled into Emergency Session, elected [[Alexander Hamilton]] as president. Hamilton swiftly proceeded to annul Paine's reforms and was re-elected president in 1793. Thomas Paine remained one of the most controversial figures in American history, some venerating him as a great hero and martyr while others regarded him as the most black of villains. At every crisis point in American history over the next centuries, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Gulf War]], Paine's name and heritage were inevitably evoked yet again. \n* In the story \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the [[Royal Navy]] ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being crush to death by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing [[New York City]] to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to '''George Washington''' as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a [[United States Senate|Senate]] whose members would likewise sit for life, and a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. [[Gouverneur Morris]], originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale [[American Civil War|civil war]]. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n*In the novel ''Washington's Dirigible'' (part of the ''[[John Barnes (author)#Timeline Wars series| The Timeline Wars series]]'' by [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]), a colossal war is raging across countless [[alternate history]] timelines, between a progressive timeline originating from a surviving [[Fifth-century Athens| Periclean Athens]] and an extremely oppressive slave society resulting from a [[Ancient Carthage |Carthaginian]] victory over Rome. The Athenians send an agent to the 18th Century who creates a new timeline by getting [[Benjamin Franklin]] appointed as the tutor of the young King [[George III]], resulting in making him a Liberal King, sympathetic to the aspirations of the North American colonists; also, many technologies and devices are introduced into the 18th Century, such as railways, dirigibles, radio and electricity (as well as flush toilets). However, the Carthaginian \"Closers\" intervene, kidnapping the King and replace him by an authoritarian impostor. '''George Washington''' becomes aware of the situation and takes a major part in the struggle to save the rightful King George III and restore him to the throne, eventually setting the world back on the route to a progressive and forward-looking British Empire. Finding out that the Carthaginian \"Closers\" had plotted to make everybody in the world into slaves, regardless of skin color, makes Washington into an opponent of slavery and he emancipates his own Black slaves and hires them as free servants. Seeing things going well in his own world and no need to create the United States, Washington becomes a full time agent of the Athenians, undertaking dangerous missions at various alternate history timelines. Instead of becoming \"Father of His Country\", George Washington becomes the \"father\" of various countries in various histories which he helped free from the oppression of the \"Closers\".\n\n===[[Daniel Webster]]===\n* In George Field's story \"Daniel Webster's Road to the Devil\", '''Daniel Webster''' avoids the accident which in actual history caused his death, and is elected president in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] over [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Vowing to \"Preserve the Union at all costs\" by strictly enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], Webster attempts to crush the [[Underground Railroad]] by setting up a network of spies and organizing extensive raids by Federal troops. One of these, at a farm in [[Massachusetts]], develops into a large-scale firefight, leading to the death of dozens of Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] as well as escaped slaves. This precipitates secessionist agitation in [[New England]]. President Webster, setting out to reason with the Massachusetts Legislature, is ambushed by abolitionists on his way to [[Boston]] and assassinated along with his Vice President, leaving the presidential succession doubtful and hotly disputed. The New England states go ahead with formally declaring all fugitive slaves welcome in their territory \u2013 which causes the South to secede in turn. The US plunges into a confused three-way [[American Civil War|civil war]] \u2013 exacerbated by large-scale [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] riots, attacks on [[Irish American]]s and the burning of Catholic churches, which prompts the Irish to form militias and embark on violent retaliations. In the confusion, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his radical Abolitionists succeed in seizing several arsenals, arming a large number of slaves and setting off several major [[slave rebellion]]s. After eleven years of total chaos, with widespread destruction and bloodshed throughout the country and no less than nine competing presidents setting themselves up at various locations, American leaders in 1864 appeal to [[Queen Victoria]] to help restore order. The war-weary population mostly welcomes the arrival of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is annulled and the former US territories are united with [[Canada]] into the [[British Dominion|Dominion]] of \"[[British North America]]\".\n\n===[[Adam Weishaupt]]===\n* '''Adam Weishaupt''' is the first President in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], after murdering and taking the identity of [[George Washington]].\n* Also ''The Secret Benefactor'' by Barbara Norden posits that '''Adam Weishaupt''' killed [[George Washington]] and took his identity. However, as presented by Norden this was a well intentioned act, since the original Washington had planned to subvert the Constitution, suspend the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and establish a hereditary monarchy, and only due to Weishaupt was American democracy maintained. Later on, in 1861 Weishaupt killed [[Abraham Lincoln]] and took his identity, since the original Lincoln did not intend to abolish slavery but was going to defeat the South and keep slavery intact - which would have led to a [[Second American Civil War|second and much worse Civil War]] twenty years later. A century later Weishaupt found it necessary to do it a third time, in 1961 killing [[John Kennedy]] and taking his identity - since the real Kennedy would have started a [[Third World War]] over the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and killed most of Humanity. During [[WWII]], Weishaupt thought [[Franklin Roosevelt ]] was doing a good job and there was no need to interfere with him, and therefore Weishaupt turned his talents in the opposite direction - killing [[Adolf Hitler]] and taking his place and as Hitler making a series of deliberate very bad decisions which greatly damaged Nazi Germany's war effort. In between, Weishaupt intentionally published a series of writings depicting himself and the Illuminati as evil schemers, in order to distract attention from what he was really doing. The book is written as a first-person narrative set down in 1997 by Weishaupt - extremely long-lived, but not an immortal - as he lay dying of old age at a secret Illuminati hideout in the Himalayas. Having found a worthy successor, who proved herself by acting behind the scenes to ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and personally overseeing the breaking down of the [[Berlin Wall]], Weishaupt charges her - or her own successors - with publishing his book \"when the world is ready for it\", but cautioning \"This account is incomplete. The secret of some of the things I had to do had best die with me\".\n\n===[[Kanye West]]===\n* In the song \"Black Friday\" by [[Kendrick Lamar]], Lamar envisions a future where West becomes president. Under West's presidency, Kendrick would be allowed to receive oral sex in the [[Oval Office]] and play West's debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'' inside of the White House.\n\n===[[Burton K. Wheeler]]===\n* In the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' by [[Philip Roth]], '''Burton Wheeler''' succeeded [[Charles Lindbergh]] as the 33rd President in 1942. Wheeler was Lindbergh's vice president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], elected on an Isolationist ticket. Following Lindbergh's disappearance, he serves as President for eight days, a period marked by martial law and anti-Semitic rioting. Wheeler is eventually impeached but ultimately pardoned by Franklin Roosevelt (elected in an emergency presidential election concurrent with the 1942 midterm elections).\n* In ''[[The Divide (novel)|The Divide]]'' by [[William Overgard]], '''Burton Wheeler''', running as the Isolationist Party candidate, defeats President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] on a pledge to keep America out of war after the Nazis force the surrender of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. After [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has overrun all of Russia, both Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] attack and invade the United States in 1941. President Wheeler surrenders the United States to the Axis after a devastating bombardment of missiles from occupied Canada. The surrender takes place on April 20, 1948, Adolf Hitler's fifty ninth birthday. President Wheeler, Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]], and other U.S. Government officials are executed by garrote in a meat packing plant outside of Washington D.C. after being found guilty of war crimes. Wheeler does leave behind a secret installation where work of producing an atomic bomb continues, in the hope that it would eventually help in liberating the country.\n* In the short story \"Fighting Bob\" by [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 election]] with '''Burton Wheeler''' as his [[running mate]]. La Follette was the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] candidate, defeating the Republican incumbent [[Calvin Coolidge]] and their Democratic opponent [[John W. Davis]]. He entered office as the 31st President on March 4, 1925. However, President La Follette's term in office proved to be short-lived as he died on June 18, 1925 (as he did in real life). Wheeler succeeded him as the 32nd President.\n\n===[[Hugh Lawson White]]===\n* In Burt F. Dealon's Alternative History novelette ''Liberate the Earth!'', the Reptile extraterrestrials of the Xiupograzixt Empire secretly intervened in the [[1836 United States presidential election]] to unite the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] around the candidature of '''Hugh Lawson White''' and get him elected President, in the correct expectation that his insistence on limiting the power of the Federal government would weaken the US. This was part of various acts in other countries, such as assassinating [[Queen Victoria]] and having a weak and unpopular king (her uncle [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]]) take the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Throne in her place, overthrowing [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis Philippe]] and plunging [[July Monarchy|France]] into a devastating civil war, instigating a civil war in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as well, fabricating sexual scandals to discredit the [[Habsburg]] Monarchy and starting a split in the [[Catholic Church]]. All of these provocations helped \"soften up\" Humanity towards the open Xiupograzixt takeover in 1841, with Reptile warriors armed with energy weapons suddenly landing in all important world capitals. President White uncovers a human traitor in the Reptile service who had infiltrated his administration and served as a senior aide, and discovers to his chagrin that he had been unknowingly the Reptiles' dupe all along his Presidency. The President orders the traitor executed and himself stages a hopeless last stand in the [[White House]], with a few remnants of the [[United States Army|US Army]] who had sworn to die at the President's side. As Earth becomes a minor Xiupograzixt province, with humans reduced to little more than expandable slaves for the Reptiles, Americans - and humans in other continents as well - secretly cherish the memory of President White as a great hero and martyr. When the Earth is finally liberated from Xiupograzixt oppression in the Liberation War of 1976, Revolutionary leaders inaugurate an monument for the heroic Last President at the site of the destroyed White House.\n\n===[[Harrison A. Williams]]===\n* '''Harrison Williams''' was a President in the 1960s in the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s \"[[Double Star]]\". Not much information is given, as this is an event of the distant past for the book's protagonists. In 1956, when Heinlein wrote the book, Williams was a rising young politician, recently elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 34, and the idea of his finally achieving the Presidency was a reasonable conjecture.\n\n===[[Wendell Willkie]]===\n* '''Wendell Willkie''' was elected president in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] (when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] decided to not seek a third term) in the [[S. M. Stirling]] novel ''[[Marching Through Georgia (novel)|Marching Through Georgia]]''. He led the United States into involvement in [[World War II]]. His vice president was [[Charles L. McNary]].\n\n===[[Woodrow Wilson]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"The Bull Moose at Bay\" by [[Mike Resnick]] contained in his anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', Roosevelt was the subject of an assassination attempt carried out by [[John Flammang Schrank]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on October 14, 1912, as he was in reality. Whereas he was shot in the chest on that occasion in real life, Schrank's bullet missed him in the story. Running as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate, Roosevelt went on to defeat both '''Woodrow Wilson''' and the extremely unpopular incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]]. Shortly after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the passenger liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] by the German [[U-boat]] ''[[SM U-20 (Germany)|U-20]]'' on May 7, 1915, President Roosevelt brought the [[American entry into World War I|United States into the Great War]], resulting in the defeat of the [[German Empire]] by the [[Allies of World War I|US and its allies]] within less than a year. This made the United States a world power. In spite of this and the fact that the economy was experiencing a boom, Roosevelt was widely expected to lose the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]] to Wilson. Although the story ends prior to the election, it is heavily implied that Wilson will indeed be elected and therefore take office as the 29th president on March 4, 1917.\n* In the short story \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]] contained in the anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', '''Woodrow Wilson''' was defeated in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] by former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate. Roosevelt became the last democratically elected President of the United States. Before he could take office, however, Roosevelt was assassinated in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on December 19, 1912, by the [[marksman|sharpshooter]] and [[Exhibition shooting|exhibition shooter]] [[Annie Oakley]] while attempting to break up a labor strike with the help of the [[Rough Riders]] at the Chicago [[Union Stockyards]]. Consequently, Vice President-elect [[Charles Foster Kane]], an extremely wealthy newspaper mogul, was inaugurated as the 28th President on March 4, 1913. During his presidency, Kane led the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption. President Kane rigged the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating Wilson and the Republican candidate former president [[William Howard Taft]] as Roosevelt had done in 1912. By February 1917, Wilson had been assassinated and many believed that Kane's agents were responsible. Wilson came to be regarded as a martyr by those opposed to Kane's regime. The [[Socialist Party of America]], led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], gained considerable report among the disenfranchised populace and soon the unrest led to outright [[Second American Civil War]]. After the [[Winter Palace|storming of the White House]] by the Socialist faction on July 4, 1917, Kane was shot and killed by Oakley, as Roosevelt had been four and a half years earlier. This resulted in the establishment of the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its first president.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''Woodrow Wilson''' served as the 9th [[President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916, serving the maximum one term prescribed by the [[Confederate States Constitution]], and led the country into the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). Following the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]'s [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914]], President Wilson affirmed the commitment of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Triple Entente|Quadruple Entente]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russia]], describing the conflict between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] as a case of a smaller nation being oppressed by a larger one. In his speech rallying the nation to war, Wilson reminded the Confederate people of the crucial role which Britain and France had played in the CSA's achievement of independence during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) as well as their importance to its continued survival. He called upon the Confederate States to stand up against the \"tyrannical\" [[German Empire]] and the \"bitter\" United States, reminding the crowd of the \"dark path\" which the US had followed and that it was the CSA's duty to be a continuing force for freedom in the world by entering the war. By the middle of 1915, the Great War, expected to be over by the previous [[Christmas]], had settled into a bloody stalemate in both [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. With only a few months left before the CS presidential election, Wilson was a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]. Nevertheless, he continued to rally the Confederate States while at the same time campaigning for his vice president [[Gabriel Semmes]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] presidential candidate. By this time, certain quarters were of the opinion that Wilson had not prosecuted the war as vigorously as he could have. President Wilson left office on March 4, 1916, and was succeeded by Semmes as the 10th president. In September 1917, the Great War ended with the defeat of the Confederate States and its allies. Wilson lived the remainder of his life in relative obscurity. Following his death in 1924, he was buried in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and was remembered with a certain fondness by later generations in the CS.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[1920: America's Great War]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''Woodrow Wilson''' is running for a third term in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] despite being bedridden. He has been praised for bringing peace to Europe as he acted as mediator for the Treaty of Princeton, and has since enacted strong [[Non-interventionism|isolationist policies]] in the U.S. and making budget cuts from the U.S. military, thinking that the world is finally at everlasting peace. However, the [[German Empire]] has greatly expanded its military influence almost unopposed across the world due to the reparations and military restrictions imposed on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente nations]], which lost [[World War I]] in 1914. German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] sees the United States as the only remaining nation that can threaten Germany, and has prepared a plan for war. By aiding the German-friendly [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]] forces of [[Venustiano Carranza]], Mexico's government is overthrown and becomes a German ally. [[Mexico]] is then to be used as a staging point to launch a joint German-Mexican surprise invasion into the [[Southwestern United States]] with the goal of the Germans to gain the vast natural resources the Empire needs while Mexico tries to re-annex [[Mexican Cession|territory lost to the United States]]. After it is found that Wilson has died in his sleep, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Thomas R. Marshall]] is next in the [[United States presidential line of succession|chain of succession]] but formally steps down for not wanting the responsibility, and thus [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] is sworn in instead. President Lansing is fully aware of the threat of invasion from Mexico and has the U.S. military desperately scramble a defense, but comes too little to late as the German Army crosses the [[Mexico-United States border|border]] into [[California]] and the [[Mexican Army]] crosses the [[Rio Grande]] into [[Texas]].\n\n===[[Oprah Winfrey]]===\n* She is referenced as being President in 2030 in an episode of the short-lived science-fiction lawyer show ''[[Century City (television)|Century City]]''\n* She is elected president in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] in an alternate history episode of ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' called [[Return of the King (Boondocks episode)|Return of the King]] around the same time [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (who survived his [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination attempt in 1968]]) died in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] at the age of 91.\n\n===[[Ed Wood]]===\n* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the ''[[Sliders]]'' Season Two premiere \"Into the Mystic\" in which the United States was ruled by a commercial empire run by a mysterious sorcerer, '''Ed Wood''' served as President prior to 1996, by which time he had died. He was considered one of the greatest Presidents in US history.\n\n===[[Victoria Woodhull]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We are Not Amused\" by [[Laura Resnick]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Victoria Woodhull''' was elected as the 19th President in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], defeating her Democratic opponent [[Horace Greeley]] after a [[Amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] restricted her predecessor [[Ulysses S.

President Woodhull, the first woman to hold the office, ran for the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] with the former slave and prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] as her [[running mate]]. Consequently, Douglass became the first [[African American]] to hold the office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Shortly after her election, Woodhull began a correspondence with her namesake, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] monarch [[Queen Victoria]]. Although the Queen was pleased to hear that President Woodhull had been acquitted of obscenity charges, she expressed dismay at the President's decision to appoint her younger sister [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], given that her medical practices had led to her being indicted for [[manslaughter]] in 1864. Furthermore, the Queen was both shocked and bewildered to learn that President Woodhull was in fact married to Colonel [[James Blood]] and not [[Canning Woodhull]] as she had previously believed. In spite of this, the President's former husband lived with her and her second husband in the [[White House]]. Given this complicated arrangement, Queen Victoria agreed with Woodhull's assessment that it would be wiser to accept advice from neither of her husbands for the time being. As time passed, however, the Queen began to greatly disapprove of the so-called reforms being implemented by the Woodhull administration. She took particular umbrage with the concept of [[free love]], believing that it would lead to the breakdown of the family, and the proposed legalization of [[prostitution]]. While the Queen acknowledged that she could not prevent President Woodhull from following this course of action, she firmly resisted the President's attempts to convince her to adopt these positions herself. Queen Victoria was equally contemptuous of the Secretary of Reproductive Freedom's mandate to supervise research and legislation regarding [[abortion]] and [[birth control]]. She also expressed dismay at the attire of the new [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to the Court of St. James]] as her short skirt exposed a considerable portion of her limbs, which the Queen claimed caused the Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] great excitement. Within several years, the changing morals and mores of American society spread to the [[British Empire]] and even to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] itself. In 1875, Queen Victoria's eldest son and [[heir apparent]] [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales]] abandoned his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] as he had chosen to practice free love in the American manner, which he regarded as \"a charming and thoroughly civilized custom.\" For her part, Princess Alexandra objected until being informed by the American ambassador that free love was her right as well. This led to the Princess becoming the constant companion of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose more recent work lacked the moral character for which he had previously been known. The Queen's youngest daughters, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], habitually wore the style of short skirt worn by American representatives at court. Thousands upon thousands of young women soon followed suit, many of them establishing \"rebellious musical groups which [played] Spanish and African instruments.\" The [[Duke of York]]'s eldest son left home to live with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes which were beginning to settle in the [[eastern United States]] whereas young men in [[Trafalgar Square]] had begun wearing their hair in the [[Mohawk hairstyle|style]] of the [[Mohawk people]] and protesting the British government's involvement in [[British Raj|India]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] was becoming a major political issue with women besieging [[10 Downing Street]] on a daily basis demanding not only the right to vote but the right to apply for men's jobs and earn equal wages and the right to paid [[maternity leave]]. This had led to widespread factory strikes across the United Kingdom. Furthermore, factories all over the UK had come to a standstill as workers demanded safer working conditions. Prostitutes took to parading up and down [[Piccadilly Circus]] in \"most indecent attire,\" demanding that the government recognize and protect their places of employment. The Queen secluded herself within the walls of [[Windsor Castle]] for six months in the hope that the situation would improve, though Gladstone believed that this downward spiral would continue for years to come. However, he assured his supporters that Britain would never have a [[Margaret Thatcher|female Prime Minister]]. The Queen was particularly upset to learn that her \"once dear friend\" [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Empress Augusta]] of the [[German Empire]] had taken to wearing a short skirt and was an adherent of President Woodhull's theory of a woman's right to [[orgasm]]. Queen Victoria held the President entirely responsible for what she perceived as the downfall of civilization, the chaos overwhelming Britain and Europe, the alienation of her sons and the disgrace of her daughters. After serving the maximum one term prescribed by law, President Woodhull left office on March 4, 1877. Her daughter Zula Maud Woodhull subsequently served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] from 1904 to 1908. Queen Victoria's letters to President Woodhull were included in ''A Correspondence Between the Victorias: An Insight into the Decline of Victorianism, 1872\u20131880'', written by the latter's descendant Dr. Wiantha Woodhull and published by Femme Fatale Press in 1992.\n\n==Y==\n===[[Ralph Yarborough]]===\n* '''Ralph Yarborough''' was [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s successor as president in Mitchell J. Freedman's novel ''A Disturbance of Fate''. He serves two terms and subsequently is killed during the events of the \"[[Second American Civil War|Second Civil War]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Lists of US Presidents and Vice Presidents}}\n{{Fictional government navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States Fictional Presidencies Of Historical Figures (V-Z), List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional Presidents of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup|reason=Too much detail; needs to be resectioned by person|date=November 2012}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2012}}\n}}\n{{FictionalPotus}}\nThe following is a list of real or historical people who have been portrayed as [[President of the United States]] in fiction, although they did not hold the office in real life. This is done either as an [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] scenario, or occasionally for humorous purposes. Also included are actual US Presidents with a fictional presidency at a different time and/or under different circumstances than the one in actual history.\n\n==V==\n===[[Martin Van Buren]]===\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[For Want of a Nail (novel)|For Want of a Nail: If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga]]'' by the business historian [[Robert Sobel]], '''Martin Van Buren''' was the leader of the Northern Confederation's Conservative Party in the 1820s and the 1830s and was the Governor of the Northern Confederation from 1825 to 1831. Unlike the Northern Confederation's Liberal Party, the Conservatives were poorly organized and had no basic political philosophy. Instead, they simply opposed Liberal policies. The Conservatives did have more popular support than the Liberals and they were able to gain a majority of seats on the Northern Confederation Council in the 1825 elections and Van Buren became governor. The Conservatives' manipulation of the banking system led to the Depression of 1829, which cost them their majority in the 1831 elections.\n\n===[[Clement Vallandigham]]===\n* In the alternate history novel \"By Force of Arms\" by Billy Bennett, '''Clement Vallandigham''' was elected President of the United States in the aftermath of the U.S. defeat in the [[American Civil War]]. His policy was one of appeasement towards the [[Confederate States of America]] in the hope of luring them back into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] by diplomacy. His strategy was a disaster in that [[Jefferson Davis]] took advantage of Vallandigham's perceived weakness by invading and annexing the southern half of the disputed [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]]/[[New Mexico Territory]]. In the aftermath Vallandigham was defeated in the next Presidential election by [[William Tecumseh Sherman]].\n* Similar to the above, in [[Ward Moore]]'s novel \"[[Bring the Jubilee]]\", the Confederacy wins the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], wins its independence and imposes a humiliating peace on the rump United States, whereupon  '''Clement Vallandigham''' wins the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]] with the electorate turning sharply against the Republicans, held responsible for the disaster. However, Vallandigham's Presidency is haunted by economic crisis and galloping inflation, due to the reparations imposed by the victorious Confederacy. The US would be permanently crippled by the post-war crisis and left a backward country, and future generations would hold Vallandigham  partially responsible.\n\n* In ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' by [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]], the invention of a functional [[analytical engine]] by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1824 results in the early arrival of the [[Information Age]] and the ascendancy of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] as a [[world power]]. British interference in North America in order to prevent the rise of the United States as a global power results in its fragmentation into a rump United States, the Confederate States, the [[Republic of Texas|Texan Republic]], the [[Californian Republic]], the [[Manhattan]] Commune and a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-dominated 'terra nullius'. In 1855, '''Clement Vallandigham''' is mentioned as being the former Union president (meaning that he had to have left office by 1853 at the latest) and acting as an uninhibited drunkard during a private dinner in [[London]].\n\n===[[Arthur H. Vandenberg]]===\n* '''Arthur Vandenberg''' was president from 1941 to 1945 in the 1939 [[Robert A. Heinlein]] novel ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]''.\n\n===[[Jesse Ventura]]===\n* '''Jesse Ventura''' is shown fighting for re-election against [[Henry Kissinger]] in ''[[Killroy and Tina]]''.\n* He is seen in the ''[[Futurama]]'' episodes \"[[A Head in the Polls]]\" and \"[[All the Presidents' Heads]]\" in the Hall of Presidents in the New New York Head Museum, implying that he served as President of either the United States or of Earth before the year 3000.\n\n===[[Kurt Vonnegut]]===\n* '''Kurt Vonnegut''' is president of the United Socialist States of America in [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]]'s ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', serving as a parallel to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].\n\n==W==\n===[[George Wallace]]===\n* In Mona Clee's ''Branch Point'' (1996), '''George Wallace''' is elected president (with [[Curtis LeMay]] as his vice president) in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]] after the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinations]] of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[Eugene McCarthy]]. In another alternate timeline in the same novel, '''George Wallace''' is elected as the 43rd President in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], succeeding [[Bill Clinton]]. The novel was published in January 1996, indicating that the author may have believed that Clinton would lose the 1996 election.\n* He served one term (1977\u20131981) in the 1975 movie ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnelvision]]'', and was succeeded by an African-American woman named Washington.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[11/22/63]]'' by [[Stephen King]], '''George Wallace''' was elected president in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]. His predecessor was [[John F. Kennedy]]. Wallace escalated the [[Vietnam War]] into a [[nuclear war]] that precipitated numerous other atomic conflicts around the globe. The state of [[Maine]] seceded from the United States and was a [[Canada|Canadian]] province by 2011. On May 15, 1972, Wallace was assassinated by [[Arthur Bremer]]. He was succeeded by Vice President [[Curtis LeMay]], who was defeated by his Democratic opponent Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minnesota]] in the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 election]].\n\n===[[Henry A. Wallace]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"News from the Front\" by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Henry Wallace''' was serving as vice president under President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the time of the United States' entry into [[World War II]] on December 11, 1941, as he was in real life. From then onwards, Roosevelt faced harsh criticism from and strict scrutiny by the American press. The press attacked the Roosevelt administration for not being prepared for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, as well as bringing on the attack by ignorantly imposing an oil embargo on the [[Empire of Japan]]. As the war progressed, the press began to constantly second-guess the Roosevelt administration and to ponder the value of the war. Furthermore, the press revealed important American military secrets, questioning the morality of spying on the [[Axis powers]], decrying the poor state of American technology and giving away planned attacks days before there were to take place, leading to their failures. More importantly, the [[Battle of Midway]] (June 4\u20137, 1942) proved to be a complete disaster. During the first half of 1942, protests against the war began to appear throughout the country and a group of celebrities took it upon themselves to sale to Japan and [[Nazi Germany]] to offer peace. The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] faced similar problems in his own country. Matters came to a head when Vice President Wallace broke with the administration and publicly attacked Roosevelt's honesty and competence. Calls for [[impeachment]] grew louder throughout the United States and, finally, Congress began the impeachment process in June 1942. Although the story ends while Roosevelt is still president, it is heavily implied that he will be [[Impeachment in the United States#Impeachment of a U.S. President|impeached]] and removed from office and that Wallace will succeed him as the 33rd President.\n* The [[GURPS Infinite Worlds]] game include the timeline known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Lenin-1|Lenin-1]]'' in which Roosevelt maintained  Wallace as his vice president when he was reelected in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]; consequently '''Henry Wallace''' became president on April 12, 1945, upon Roosevelt's death. His passive stance (and that of his successors) against the [[Soviet Union]] resulted in the steady expansion of [[Communism]] across the globe. By 1989, the isolated and malaise-stricken United States is essentially the sole remaining [[capitalism|capitalist]] country on the planet. Also resulting from Wallace becoming president in 1945 is the \"Hell World\" known as ''[[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Hell Worlds|Lenin-2]]'' where nuclear war and unconstrained industry have combined to crash the [[biosphere]].\n* Wallace also played an unfortunate role in the history of another unpleasant [[GURPS Infinite Worlds|GURPS]] timeline, known as [[GURPS Infinite Worlds#Reich-5|Reich-5]]. In this timeline [[Giuseppe Zangara]] succeeded in assassinating [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1933. He was followed by [[John Nance Garner|Garner]], [[Charles Lindbergh|Lindbergh]] and then '''Henry Wallace''', who all proved unable to handle the [[Great Depression]] - finally leading to the far-right [[William Dudley Pelley]] being elected president in [[1948 United States presidential election|1944]], assuming dictatorial powers, and inviting the Nazis to conquer the US to help him against the pro-democracy resistance - ending with a totally Nazi-dominated world.\n* '''Wallace''' becomes president after World War II in the ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' strip ''Hope:... for the Future'' by [[Guy Adams]], set in a [[film noir]] world where magic is real.\n\n===[[Earl Warren]]===\n* In the [[Colonization (series)|''Colonization'' series]] by [[Harry Turtledove]], '''Earl Warren''' served as President of the United States from 1961 to 1965. He was elected president in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]] and would be re-elected in a landslide over his Democratic opponent [[Hubert Humphrey]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. He was in office when the [[The Race (Worldwar)|Race]]'s Colonization Fleet arrived at Earth in 1962 and ordered a secret attack using [[nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]] fired from a [[artificial satellite|satellite]] that destroyed a dozen of the Fleet's starships. President Warren concealed his role in the affair for several years but the information was ultimately leaked to the Race in 1965 by Sam Yeager through Shiplord Straha, despite Warren's best efforts to silence Yeager through draconian extralegal measures. Fleetlord Atvar threatened war with the United States. Having seen how quickly and easily the Race had defeated Germany in the short-lived Race-German of 1965, President Warren knew he must avoid a war at all costs. Atvar offered two other options: abandon all space exploration for the indefinite future or allow the Race to destroy an American city. Warren knew he that must choose one of the two lest his country be destroyed and he would not give up the space program, a sign of his country's might and technological prowess. Consequently, he surprised and disappointed Atvar by allowing him to destroy [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Warren then committed suicide in the Gray House, the presidential residence in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], and was succeeded by his vice president, [[Harold Stassen]].\n\n===[[George Washington]]===\n* In a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the short story \"[[He Walked Around the Horses]]\" by [[H. Beam Piper]], '''General George Washington''' was killed in the [[Doylestown, Pennsylvania|Battle of Doylestown]] during the short-lived [[American Revolution|rebellion]] of the colonies in [[British North America]] in the 1770s. He died in the arms of [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]]. A seemingly insane individual who claimed to be a British diplomat named [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Benjamin Bathurst]] maintained that the American rebels were successful in their attempts to achieve independence and that Washington survived.\n* In the short story \"The Father of His Country\" by [[Jody Lynn Nye]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''George Washington''' ran against [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the [[1788-89 United States presidential election|first United States presidential election in 1789]]. In spite of the fact that Franklin was 83&nbsp;years old and was rumored to have fathered numerous illegitimate children while serving as [[United States Ambassador to France|ambassador to France]] from 1778 to 1785, he was elected by the [[1st United States Congress]] on April 6, 1789, in part due to reservations voiced by prominent members of Congress such as [[John Hancock]] and [[Charles Thomson]] regarding Washington. They were concerned that it would set a bad precedent for the first President to be a general. Furthermore, Franklin's supporters stressed that he was well liked and respected by foreign heads of state friendly to the United States, had been prominent in matters of diplomacy and government at home and abroad and had already proven that he had the best interests of the nation at heart. Franklin was inaugurated as the first President of the United States in [[Federal Hall]] in [[New York City]] on April 30, 1789. Franklin's vice president was [[John Adams]] who had supported Washington in Congress, as had his second cousin [[Samuel Adams]]. During his tenure in office, President Franklin attempted to create a more democratic society and managed to live longer than he did in real life, serving until at least 1792.\n* In the [[alternate history]] novel ''[[The Two Georges]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]], '''Colonel George Washington''' was part of a group of American colonists who met with [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of the United Kingdom]] in the 1760s and were able to put in place an eleventh hour agreement with avoided [[American Revolution|revolution]]. Washington and the King were immortalized in a painting entitled ''The Two Georges'' by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], which came to symbolize the friendship between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[North American Union]]. In his later career as the [[Governor-general]] of the North American Union, Washington implemented a policy which halted the westward expansion of European settlement for some decades and gave a chance to certain [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes such as the [[Iroquois]] and the [[Cherokee]] to modernize and keep much of their lands. For that reasons, he greatly revered by Native Americans into the late 20th century. The Iroquois believed that he was the only white person to be admitted to their religion's version of [[Paradise]]. Conversely, he is considered a traitor by the nativist, separatist organization, the [[Sons of Liberty]]. He is also the namesake of the Province of Washington (analogous with Saskatchewan) and an NAU car marque.\n* In the short story \"Arnoldstown\" by [[Mitchell Cummings]], '''General George Washington''' died of [[pneumonia]] during the winter of 1777\u20131778, which led to the near disintegration of the [[Continental Army]]. [[Benedict Arnold]] eventually succeeded him as its commanding general, rebuilt the army and snatched victory from the jaws of near-certain defeat. After independence had been secured through the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), Arnold went on to be elected as the first President of the United States in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]]. He was the most revered of all the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] in later generations. The story's name is derived from the US capital in this timeline being [[Washington, D.C.|Arnoldstown, D.C.]] with his name also being commemorated in the state of [[Washington (state)|Arnoldia]] on the [[Pacific Northwest]] and numerous other place-names.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''George Washington''' served as the first President from April 30, 1789, to March 4, 1797, as he was in real life. After the [[Confederate States of America]] achieved its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862), U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as the most memorable of presidents, though only Roosevelt was viewed in an entirely positive light. As a young man, Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader. However, the general public did not always remembered kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the US suffered because of it \u2013 as did that of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the US occupation authorities in [[Canada]]). Nonetheless, the US rebuilt the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). The Confederates were themselves saddened of the monument being destroyed in the war as well, as they were fond of George Washington, too. In fact, before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father as well but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[Robert E. Lee]]. The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under Anthony Dresser, used Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan, \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first and President of the United States second. [[Washington and Lee University|Washington University]] in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[nuclear weapon|superbomb]], retained its name and the statue of Washington that stood in the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]] survived both Great Wars.\n* In [[Michael Flynn (writer)|Michael Flynn]]'s [[novella]] ''[[The Forest of Time]]'', in the late 1780's General '''George Washington''' took a personal interest in the [[Pennamite\u2013Yankee Wars]] - i.e. the violent conflict between Pennamites from [[Pennsilvania]] and Yankees from [[Connecticut]], both of whom laid claim to the [[Wyoming Valley]] and sent rival groups of settlers to it. In a fatally misguided step, Washington placed a unit of the Virginia Militia, commanded by himself, as a neutral buffer between Pennamites and Yankees. This culminated with the Virginians being trapped and decimated in a crossfire, Washington himself being among those killed. When the news of  Washington's death reached [[Philadelphia]], where the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] was just convening, [[Benjamin Franklin]] suffered a stroke and died, too. The convention broke up in consternation, and the [[Constitution of the United States]] was never adopted and a Federal Government never created. The loose structure of the [[Continental Congress]] eventually disintegrated, with the Thirteen Colonies going each its own way as full-fledged nation states - except that the Yankees of [[New England]] did create their own more narrow confederation. In this situation, Yankee settlers - backed by the rest of New England - held on to much of the Wyoming Valley, their conflict with Pennsilvania further escalating. Eventually, two mutually hostile nation states emerged, possessing fully equipped regular armies - hereditary enemies which habitually and repeatedly go to war with each other. Posterity remembered George Washington as a talented general who won what was remembered as ''The War Against the British''. However, that war itself was remembered only as a temporary and ephemeral alliance, whose participants later often went to war with each other. Washington having been a Virginian, most people in North America thought of him as a foreigner and people in Virginia's neighbors thought of him as having been from an an enemy country. \n* In the [[North American Confederacy|North American Confederacy Series]] novel [[The Probability Broach]] by [[L. Neil Smith]], the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] succeeds after [[Albert Gallatin]] intercedes to help the farmers rather than the fledgling United States government as he does in reality. This results in the rebellion becoming a [[Second American Revolution]]. This eventually leads to the overthrowing and execution of '''George Washington''' by firing squad for [[treason]] in 1794 and the United States Government being reformed. This included the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] being declared null and void, a new caretaker government being organized with all taxes being repelled in 1795, and the [[Articles of Confederation]] being revised with a much emphasis on individual freedom in 1797. After the war, Gallatin would serve as the 2nd and 7th president from 1794 to 1812 and from 1836 to 1840 with his actions later starting a [[libertarian]] state known as the [[North American Confederacy]] in 1893. Despite this, Gallatin insisted that historians would still count George Washington as the first president.\n* In the novel ''[[Tunnel Through the Deeps]]'' by [[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]], in which the United States lost the American Revolution, '''Washington''' was executed for treason. America remained under control of the [[British Empire]] well into the 20th century. Washington's descendant, a gifted engineer still living in the ancestral [[Mount Vernon]], undertakes the stupendous project of a tunnel under the Atlantic which would bind America closer than ever to Britain.\n* In the alternate history series ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], '''George Washington''' is mentioned as \"Lord Potomac\", who served under the English crown during the alternate version of the [[American Revolution]]. However, he surrendered his army and was [[Decapitation|beheaded]] for treason.\n* In the story \"Paine's Paine\" by Margaret Klein, conspirators led by the turncoat [[Thomas Hickey (soldier)|Thomas Hickey]] managing to kidnap '''George Washington''' in 1776 and deliver him to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] commander, Sir [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]]. Transported by a British warship, Washington was taken to the [[Tower of London]], to await trial on charges of [[High treason]]. However, the revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] secretly traveled to [[England]] and with the help of British radicals effected a dramatic prison break. Paine and the freed Washington boarded a ship captained by [[John Paul Jones]], which eluded the [[Royal Navy]] and arrived triumphantly at [[Boston]]. Paine was venerated as a hero and appointed as Washington's second in command. Throughout the rest of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the two of them together led the American forces. There was, however, a fundamental difference between  Washington's conservatism and Paine's radical ideas, which came into the open once independence was achieved. Eventually, Washington and Paine became bitter political foes. Following the first presidential election in [[1788-89 United States presidential election|1789]], Washington was elected President and Paine - Vice President, but there was increasing friction between them which culminated in a violent clash in August 1790. Washington was killed by a militia supporting Paine. He himself denied responsibility and expressed \"great regret\" at Washington's death. In the aftermath, Paine assumed the Presidency but was regarded as an illegal usurper by a considerable part of the American public and initially sought to mollify his opponents and reach a compromise, but in vain. After surviving three assassination attempts and facing several armed insurrections, Paine saw no alternative but resorting to increasingly harsh measures against his opponents. These tarnished his reputation and earned him the nickname \"The American [[Robespierre]]\". In the face of mounting opposition, Paine tried to rally his followers, including radical intellectuals and working-class crowds, around a program of thorough social and political reform. He had some successes but was assassinated in November 1792, after issuing a Proclamation for Emancipation of the Slaves which he did not live to implement. After Paine's death, there was a sharp conservative backlash, Paine's main supporters being arrested or fleeing to exile in [[French Revolution|Revolutionary]] [[French First Republic|France]]. The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], recalled into Emergency Session, elected [[Alexander Hamilton]] as president. Hamilton swiftly proceeded to annul Paine's reforms and was re-elected president in 1793. Thomas Paine remained one of the most controversial figures in American history, some venerating him as a great hero and martyr while others regarded him as the most black of villains. At every crisis point in American history over the next centuries, from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] to the [[Vietnam War]] and the [[Gulf War]], Paine's name and heritage were inevitably evoked yet again. \n* In the story \"Under the Dark Cloud\" by Abigail Stanton Wade, a fierce hurricane broke out during the [[Battle of Long Island]], scattering the [[Royal Navy]] ships and drowning many of them, with devastating losses for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. Also many of the British troops on land were decimated by the storm, their commander [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|William Howe]] being crush to death by a falling tree - while American troops escaped virtually unscathed. This outcome, coming at the very moment when the American Revolutionary cause seemed on the verge of losing [[New York City]] to the British, was widely perceived as an act of Divine Providence. During a mass Thanksgiving ceremony at the New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]], a preacher referred to '''George Washington''' as \"God's [[Anointed]]\" - a usage which was soon taken up by others. With Washington winning several more notable victories against the British, a growing number of people started to seriously regard him as \"God's Chosen\", entrusted with \"a Divine Mission\". Washington cultivated  this phenomenon for political purposes - but in the following years he seemed to start believing in it himself. The Washington [[cult of personality]] reached its peak when he brought the war to a successful conclusion in January 1779 - forcing the British to recognize American independence. The [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], held at 1782 in New York, was dominated by Washington and his supporters. The Constitution adopted provided for a President elected for life (and there was little doubt who it would be), a [[United States Senate|Senate]] whose members would likewise sit for life, and a [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] elected by limited franchise. The \"Washington Constitution\" alienated many Democrats who withdrew in protest when the Convention failed to include a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. [[Gouverneur Morris]], originally a friend and staunch supporter of George Washington, was repelled by what he perceived as Washington's increasing authoritarianism, arrogance and intolerance towards anyone who opposed him. Morris sought to promote a compromise between Washington and his opponents - but in vain. Soon after Washington assumed the Life Presidency, an armed rebellion broke out - which at Washington's order was put down with considerable brutality. Washington's opponents were driven underground - but after half a year, three of them managed to assassinate Washington. Thereupon, the United States was plunged into a full-scale [[American Civil War|civil war]]. This was exacerbated by the British reneging on the agreement, launching a large-scale invasion of the US and attempting to put in place a puppet President. Forces loyal to [[Thomas Jefferson]] succeeded in repulsing the British invasion and breaking up the last of the die-hard Washingtonians - but Jefferson was himself killed in the last battle. In the aftermath, Gouverneur Morris came to the fore in the efforts to achieve reconciliation - specifically, in convening a new Constitutional Convention. The Washington Constitution was scrapped. The new Constitution, much of it drafted by Morris, provided for a President elected for a single six-year term and ineligible for re-election, an elected Senate except for five Life Senators, and a Bill of Rights comprising thirteen articles. The new Constitution gained wide support and Gouverneur Morris was elected President by a large majority. He considered the furthering of reconciliation as his main task, and got nicknamed \"The Great Healer\". After his death, Congress bestowed upon him the title \"Father of His Country\" and resolved to count him as having been First President of the United States - the Washington Years being dismissed as \"an interregnum\".\n*In the novel ''Washington's Dirigible'' (part of the ''[[John Barnes (author)#Timeline Wars series| The Timeline Wars series]]'' by [[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]), a colossal war is raging across countless [[alternate history]] timelines, between a progressive timeline originating from a surviving [[Fifth-century Athens| Periclean Athens]] and an extremely oppressive slave society resulting from a [[Ancient Carthage |Carthaginian]] victory over Rome. The Athenians send an agent to the 18th Century who creates a new timeline by getting [[Benjamin Franklin]] appointed as the tutor of the young King [[George III]], resulting in making him a Liberal King, sympathetic to the aspirations of the North American colonists; also, many technologies and devices are introduced into the 18th Century, such as railways, dirigibles, radio and electricity (as well as flush toilets). However, the Carthaginian \"Closers\" intervene, kidnapping the King and replace him by an authoritarian impostor. '''George Washington''' becomes aware of the situation and takes a major part in the struggle to save the rightful King George III and restore him to the throne, eventually setting the world back on the route to a progressive and forward-looking British Empire. Finding out that the Carthaginian \"Closers\" had plotted to make everybody in the world into slaves, regardless of skin color, makes Washington into an opponent of slavery and he emancipates his own Black slaves and hires them as free servants. Seeing things going well in his own world and no need to create the United States, Washington becomes a full time agent of the Athenians, undertaking dangerous missions at various alternate history timelines. Instead of becoming \"Father of His Country\", George Washington becomes the \"father\" of various countries in various histories which he helped free from the oppression of the \"Closers\".\n\n===[[Daniel Webster]]===\n* In George Field's story \"Daniel Webster's Road to the Devil\", '''Daniel Webster''' avoids the accident which in actual history caused his death, and is elected president in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] over [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[Winfield Scott]]. Vowing to \"Preserve the Union at all costs\" by strictly enforcing the [[Fugitive Slave Laws]], Webster attempts to crush the [[Underground Railroad]] by setting up a network of spies and organizing extensive raids by Federal troops. One of these, at a farm in [[Massachusetts]], develops into a large-scale firefight, leading to the death of dozens of Northern [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] as well as escaped slaves. This precipitates secessionist agitation in [[New England]]. President Webster, setting out to reason with the Massachusetts Legislature, is ambushed by abolitionists on his way to [[Boston]] and assassinated along with his Vice President, leaving the presidential succession doubtful and hotly disputed. The New England states go ahead with formally declaring all fugitive slaves welcome in their territory \u2013 which causes the South to secede in turn. The US plunges into a confused three-way [[American Civil War|civil war]] \u2013 exacerbated by large-scale [[Nativism (politics)|Nativist]] riots, attacks on [[Irish American]]s and the burning of Catholic churches, which prompts the Irish to form militias and embark on violent retaliations. In the confusion, [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and his radical Abolitionists succeed in seizing several arsenals, arming a large number of slaves and setting off several major [[slave rebellion]]s. After eleven years of total chaos, with widespread destruction and bloodshed throughout the country and no less than nine competing presidents setting themselves up at various locations, American leaders in 1864 appeal to [[Queen Victoria]] to help restore order. The war-weary population mostly welcomes the arrival of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops. The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] is annulled and the former US territories are united with [[Canada]] into the [[British Dominion|Dominion]] of \"[[British North America]]\".\n\n===[[Adam Weishaupt]]===\n* '''Adam Weishaupt''' is the first President in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], after murdering and taking the identity of [[George Washington]].\n* Also ''The Secret Benefactor'' by Barbara Norden posits that '''Adam Weishaupt''' killed [[George Washington]] and took his identity. However, as presented by Norden this was a well intentioned act, since the original Washington had planned to subvert the Constitution, suspend the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and establish a hereditary monarchy, and only due to Weishaupt was American democracy maintained. Later on, in 1861 Weishaupt killed [[Abraham Lincoln]] and took his identity, since the original Lincoln did not intend to abolish slavery but was going to defeat the South and keep slavery intact - which would have led to a [[Second American Civil War|second and much worse Civil War]] twenty years later. A century later Weishaupt found it necessary to do it a third time, in 1961 killing [[John Kennedy]] and taking his identity - since the real Kennedy would have started a [[Third World War]] over the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and killed most of Humanity. During [[WWII]], Weishaupt thought [[Franklin Roosevelt ]] was doing a good job and there was no need to interfere with him, and therefore Weishaupt turned his talents in the opposite direction - killing [[Adolf Hitler]] and taking his place and as Hitler making a series of deliberate very bad decisions which greatly damaged Nazi Germany's war effort. In between, Weishaupt intentionally published a series of writings depicting himself and the Illuminati as evil schemers, in order to distract attention from what he was really doing. The book is written as a first-person narrative set down in 1997 by Weishaupt - extremely long-lived, but not an immortal - as he lay dying of old age at a secret Illuminati hideout in the Himalayas. Having found a worthy successor, who proved herself by acting behind the scenes to ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and personally overseeing the breaking down of the [[Berlin Wall]], Weishaupt charges her - or her own successors - with publishing his book \"when the world is ready for it\", but cautioning \"This account is incomplete. The secret of some of the things I had to do had best die with me\".\n\n===[[Kanye West]]===\n* In the song \"Black Friday\" by [[Kendrick Lamar]], Lamar envisions a future where West becomes president. Under West's presidency, Kendrick would be allowed to receive oral sex in the [[Oval Office]] and play West's debut album ''[[The College Dropout]]'' inside of the White House.\n\n===[[Burton K. Wheeler]]===\n* In the [[alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]] novel ''[[The Plot Against America]]'' by [[Philip Roth]], '''Burton Wheeler''' succeeded [[Charles Lindbergh]] as the 33rd President in 1942. Wheeler was Lindbergh's vice president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], elected on an Isolationist ticket. Following Lindbergh's disappearance, he serves as President for eight days, a period marked by martial law and anti-Semitic rioting. Wheeler is eventually impeached but ultimately pardoned by Franklin Roosevelt (elected in an emergency presidential election concurrent with the 1942 midterm elections).\n* In ''[[The Divide (novel)|The Divide]]'' by [[William Overgard]], '''Burton Wheeler''', running as the Isolationist Party candidate, defeats President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] on a pledge to keep America out of war after the Nazis force the surrender of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]]. After [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] has overrun all of Russia, both Germany and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] attack and invade the United States in 1941. President Wheeler surrenders the United States to the Axis after a devastating bombardment of missiles from occupied Canada. The surrender takes place on April 20, 1948, Adolf Hitler's fifty ninth birthday. President Wheeler, Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]], and other U.S. Government officials are executed by garrote in a meat packing plant outside of Washington D.C. after being found guilty of war crimes. Wheeler does leave behind a secret installation where work of producing an atomic bomb continues, in the hope that it would eventually help in liberating the country.\n* In the short story \"Fighting Bob\" by [[Kristine Kathryn Rusch]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 election]] with '''Burton Wheeler''' as his [[running mate]]. La Follette was the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] candidate, defeating the Republican incumbent [[Calvin Coolidge]] and their Democratic opponent [[John W. Davis]]. He entered office as the 31st President on March 4, 1925. However, President La Follette's term in office proved to be short-lived as he died on June 18, 1925 (as he did in real life). Wheeler succeeded him as the 32nd President.\n\n===[[Hugh Lawson White]]===\n* In Burt F. Dealon's Alternative History novelette ''Liberate the Earth!'', the Reptile extraterrestrials of the Xiupograzixt Empire secretly intervened in the [[1836 United States presidential election]] to unite the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] around the candidature of '''Hugh Lawson White''' and get him elected President, in the correct expectation that his insistence on limiting the power of the Federal government would weaken the US. This was part of various acts in other countries, such as assassinating [[Queen Victoria]] and having a weak and unpopular king (her uncle [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]]) take the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] Throne in her place, overthrowing [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis Philippe]] and plunging [[July Monarchy|France]] into a devastating civil war, instigating a civil war in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as well, fabricating sexual scandals to discredit the [[Habsburg]] Monarchy and starting a split in the [[Catholic Church]]. All of these provocations helped \"soften up\" Humanity towards the open Xiupograzixt takeover in 1841, with Reptile warriors armed with energy weapons suddenly landing in all important world capitals. President White uncovers a human traitor in the Reptile service who had infiltrated his administration and served as a senior aide, and discovers to his chagrin that he had been unknowingly the Reptiles' dupe all along his Presidency. The President orders the traitor executed and himself stages a hopeless last stand in the [[White House]], with a few remnants of the [[United States Army|US Army]] who had sworn to die at the President's side. As Earth becomes a minor Xiupograzixt province, with humans reduced to little more than expandable slaves for the Reptiles, Americans - and humans in other continents as well - secretly cherish the memory of President White as a great hero and martyr. When the Earth is finally liberated from Xiupograzixt oppression in the Liberation War of 1976, Revolutionary leaders inaugurate an monument for the heroic Last President at the site of the destroyed White House.\n\n===[[Harrison A. Williams]]===\n* '''Harrison Williams''' was a President in the 1960s in the timeline of [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s \"[[Double Star]]\". Not much information is given, as this is an event of the distant past for the book's protagonists. In 1956, when Heinlein wrote the book, Williams was a rising young politician, recently elected to the House of Representatives at the age of 34, and the idea of his finally achieving the Presidency was a reasonable conjecture.\n\n===[[Wendell Willkie]]===\n* '''Wendell Willkie''' was elected president in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]] (when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] decided to not seek a third term) in the [[S. M. Stirling]] novel ''[[Marching Through Georgia (novel)|Marching Through Georgia]]''. He led the United States into involvement in [[World War II]]. His vice president was [[Charles L. McNary]].\n\n===[[Woodrow Wilson]]===\n* In the alternate history short story \"The Bull Moose at Bay\" by [[Mike Resnick]] contained in his anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'', Roosevelt was the subject of an assassination attempt carried out by [[John Flammang Schrank]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], on October 14, 1912, as he was in reality. Whereas he was shot in the chest on that occasion in real life, Schrank's bullet missed him in the story. Running as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate, Roosevelt went on to defeat both '''Woodrow Wilson''' and the extremely unpopular incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]]. Shortly after the [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sinking of the passenger liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] by the German [[U-boat]] ''[[SM U-20 (Germany)|U-20]]'' on May 7, 1915, President Roosevelt brought the [[American entry into World War I|United States into the Great War]], resulting in the defeat of the [[German Empire]] by the [[Allies of World War I|US and its allies]] within less than a year. This made the United States a world power. In spite of this and the fact that the economy was experiencing a boom, Roosevelt was widely expected to lose the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]] to Wilson. Although the story ends prior to the election, it is heavily implied that Wilson will indeed be elected and therefore take office as the 29th president on March 4, 1917.\n* In the short story \"Ten Days That Shook the World\" by [[Kim Newman]] and [[Eugene Byrne]] contained in the anthology ''[[Back in the USSA]]'', '''Woodrow Wilson''' was defeated in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]] by former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] candidate. Roosevelt became the last democratically elected President of the United States. Before he could take office, however, Roosevelt was assassinated in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], on December 19, 1912, by the [[marksman|sharpshooter]] and [[Exhibition shooting|exhibition shooter]] [[Annie Oakley]] while attempting to break up a labor strike with the help of the [[Rough Riders]] at the Chicago [[Union Stockyards]]. Consequently, Vice President-elect [[Charles Foster Kane]], an extremely wealthy newspaper mogul, was inaugurated as the 28th President on March 4, 1913. During his presidency, Kane led the United States into greater levels of oppression, class division and bureaucratic incompetence and corruption. President Kane rigged the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], defeating Wilson and the Republican candidate former president [[William Howard Taft]] as Roosevelt had done in 1912. By February 1917, Wilson had been assassinated and many believed that Kane's agents were responsible. Wilson came to be regarded as a martyr by those opposed to Kane's regime. The [[Socialist Party of America]], led by [[Eugene V. Debs]], gained considerable report among the disenfranchised populace and soon the unrest led to outright [[Second American Civil War]]. After the [[Winter Palace|storming of the White House]] by the Socialist faction on July 4, 1917, Kane was shot and killed by Oakley, as Roosevelt had been four and a half years earlier. This resulted in the establishment of the United Socialist States of America (USSA) with Debs as its first president.\n* In [[Harry Turtledove]]'s ''[[Southern Victory Series|Southern Victory]]'' alternate history series, '''Woodrow Wilson''' served as the 9th [[President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916, serving the maximum one term prescribed by the [[Confederate States Constitution]], and led the country into the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] (1914\u20131917). Following the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]'s [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914]], President Wilson affirmed the commitment of the [[Confederate States of America]] to the [[Triple Entente|Quadruple Entente]] with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russia]], describing the conflict between [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Serbia]] as a case of a smaller nation being oppressed by a larger one. In his speech rallying the nation to war, Wilson reminded the Confederate people of the crucial role which Britain and France had played in the CSA's achievement of independence during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) as well as their importance to its continued survival. He called upon the Confederate States to stand up against the \"tyrannical\" [[German Empire]] and the \"bitter\" United States, reminding the crowd of the \"dark path\" which the US had followed and that it was the CSA's duty to be a continuing force for freedom in the world by entering the war. By the middle of 1915, the Great War, expected to be over by the previous [[Christmas]], had settled into a bloody stalemate in both [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. With only a few months left before the CS presidential election, Wilson was a [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]. Nevertheless, he continued to rally the Confederate States while at the same time campaigning for his vice president [[Gabriel Semmes]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] presidential candidate. By this time, certain quarters were of the opinion that Wilson had not prosecuted the war as vigorously as he could have. President Wilson left office on March 4, 1916, and was succeeded by Semmes as the 10th president. In September 1917, the Great War ended with the defeat of the Confederate States and its allies. Wilson lived the remainder of his life in relative obscurity. Following his death in 1924, he was buried in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and was remembered with a certain fondness by later generations in the CS.\n* In the alternate history novel ''[[1920: America's Great War]]'' by [[Robert Conroy]], '''Woodrow Wilson''' is running for a third term in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] despite being bedridden. He has been praised for bringing peace to Europe as he acted as mediator for the Treaty of Princeton, and has since enacted strong [[Non-interventionism|isolationist policies]] in the U.S. and making budget cuts from the U.S. military, thinking that the world is finally at everlasting peace. However, the [[German Empire]] has greatly expanded its military influence almost unopposed across the world due to the reparations and military restrictions imposed on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente nations]], which lost [[World War I]] in 1914. German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] sees the United States as the only remaining nation that can threaten Germany, and has prepared a plan for war. By aiding the German-friendly [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary]] forces of [[Venustiano Carranza]], Mexico's government is overthrown and becomes a German ally. [[Mexico]] is then to be used as a staging point to launch a joint German-Mexican surprise invasion into the [[Southwestern United States]] with the goal of the Germans to gain the vast natural resources the Empire needs while Mexico tries to re-annex [[Mexican Cession|territory lost to the United States]]. After it is found that Wilson has died in his sleep, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Thomas R. Marshall]] is next in the [[United States presidential line of succession|chain of succession]] but formally steps down for not wanting the responsibility, and thus [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] is sworn in instead. President Lansing is fully aware of the threat of invasion from Mexico and has the U.S. military desperately scramble a defense, but comes too little to late as the German Army crosses the [[Mexico-United States border|border]] into [[California]] and the [[Mexican Army]] crosses the [[Rio Grande]] into [[Texas]].\n\n===[[Oprah Winfrey]]===\n* She is referenced as being President in 2030 in an episode of the short-lived science-fiction lawyer show ''[[Century City (television)|Century City]]''\n* She is elected president in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]] in an alternate history episode of ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'' called [[Return of the King (Boondocks episode)|Return of the King]] around the same time [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] (who survived his [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination attempt in 1968]]) died in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] at the age of 91.\n\n===[[Ed Wood]]===\n* In a [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] featured in the ''[[Sliders]]'' Season Two premiere \"Into the Mystic\" in which the United States was ruled by a commercial empire run by a mysterious sorcerer, '''Ed Wood''' served as President prior to 1996, by which time he had died. He was considered one of the greatest Presidents in US history.\n\n===[[Victoria Woodhull]]===\n* In the [[alternate history]] short story \"We are Not Amused\" by [[Laura Resnick]] contained in the anthology ''[[Alternate Presidents]]'' by [[Mike Resnick]], '''Victoria Woodhull''' was elected as the 19th President in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], defeating her Democratic opponent [[Horace Greeley]] after a [[Amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] restricted her predecessor [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to one term. President Woodhull, the first woman to hold the office, ran for the [[Equal Rights Party (United States)|Equal Rights Party]] with the former slave and prominent [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Frederick Douglass]] as her [[running mate]]. Consequently, Douglass became the first [[African American]] to hold the office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]]. Shortly after her election, Woodhull began a correspondence with her namesake, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] monarch [[Queen Victoria]]. Although the Queen was pleased to hear that President Woodhull had been acquitted of obscenity charges, she expressed dismay at the President's decision to appoint her younger sister [[Tennessee Celeste Claflin]] as [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]], given that her medical practices had led to her being indicted for [[manslaughter]] in 1864. Furthermore, the Queen was both shocked and bewildered to learn that President Woodhull was in fact married to Colonel [[James Blood]] and not [[Canning Woodhull]] as she had previously believed. In spite of this, the President's former husband lived with her and her second husband in the [[White House]]. Given this complicated arrangement, Queen Victoria agreed with Woodhull's assessment that it would be wiser to accept advice from neither of her husbands for the time being. As time passed, however, the Queen began to greatly disapprove of the so-called reforms being implemented by the Woodhull administration. She took particular umbrage with the concept of [[free love]], believing that it would lead to the breakdown of the family, and the proposed legalization of [[prostitution]]. While the Queen acknowledged that she could not prevent President Woodhull from following this course of action, she firmly resisted the President's attempts to convince her to adopt these positions herself. Queen Victoria was equally contemptuous of the Secretary of Reproductive Freedom's mandate to supervise research and legislation regarding [[abortion]] and [[birth control]]. She also expressed dismay at the attire of the new [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|American ambassador to the Court of St. James]] as her short skirt exposed a considerable portion of her limbs, which the Queen claimed caused the Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] great excitement. Within several years, the changing morals and mores of American society spread to the [[British Empire]] and even to the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] itself. In 1875, Queen Victoria's eldest son and [[heir apparent]] [[Edward VII|Albert, Prince of Wales]] abandoned his wife [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] as he had chosen to practice free love in the American manner, which he regarded as \"a charming and thoroughly civilized custom.\" For her part, Princess Alexandra objected until being informed by the American ambassador that free love was her right as well. This led to the Princess becoming the constant companion of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose more recent work lacked the moral character for which he had previously been known. The Queen's youngest daughters, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], habitually wore the style of short skirt worn by American representatives at court. Thousands upon thousands of young women soon followed suit, many of them establishing \"rebellious musical groups which [played] Spanish and African instruments.\" The [[Duke of York]]'s eldest son left home to live with the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes which were beginning to settle in the [[eastern United States]] whereas young men in [[Trafalgar Square]] had begun wearing their hair in the [[Mohawk hairstyle|style]] of the [[Mohawk people]] and protesting the British government's involvement in [[British Raj|India]] and [[South Africa]]. [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] was becoming a major political issue with women besieging [[10 Downing Street]] on a daily basis demanding not only the right to vote but the right to apply for men's jobs and earn equal wages and the right to paid [[maternity leave]]. This had led to widespread factory strikes across the United Kingdom. Furthermore, factories all over the UK had come to a standstill as workers demanded safer working conditions. Prostitutes took to parading up and down [[Piccadilly Circus]] in \"most indecent attire,\" demanding that the government recognize and protect their places of employment. The Queen secluded herself within the walls of [[Windsor Castle]] for six months in the hope that the situation would improve, though Gladstone believed that this downward spiral would continue for years to come. However, he assured his supporters that Britain would never have a [[Margaret Thatcher|female Prime Minister]]. The Queen was particularly upset to learn that her \"once dear friend\" [[Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Empress Augusta]] of the [[German Empire]] had taken to wearing a short skirt and was an adherent of President Woodhull's theory of a woman's right to [[orgasm]]. Queen Victoria held the President entirely responsible for what she perceived as the downfall of civilization, the chaos overwhelming Britain and Europe, the alienation of her sons and the disgrace of her daughters. After serving the maximum one term prescribed by law, President Woodhull left office on March 4, 1877. Her daughter Zula Maud Woodhull subsequently served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] from 1904 to 1908. Queen Victoria's letters to President Woodhull were included in ''A Correspondence Between the Victorias: An Insight into the Decline of Victorianism, 1872\u20131880'', written by the latter's descendant Dr. Wiantha Woodhull and published by Femme Fatale Press in 1992.\n\n==Y==\n===[[Ralph Yarborough]]===\n* '''Ralph Yarborough''' was [[Robert F.

He and a new team of DJs known as the Get Fresh Crew (Barry Bee and Chill Will), along with newcomer MC Ricky D (who would later achieve fame as [[Slick Rick]]), came to fledgling New Jersey-based hip-hop label [[Fantasy Records|Danya/Reality Records]] the following year and recorded \"[[The Show (Doug E.

Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K.

[[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]]. Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] in Egypt during the 1880s.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/profiles/sir-william-flinders-petrie-1853-1942|title= Sir William Flinders Petrie|publisher=Palestine Exploration Fund|year=2000|accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including [[Howard Carter]] who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh [[Tutankhamun]].\n\n[[File:Aerial photograph of Maiden Castle from the west, 1937.jpg|thumb|left|alt=earthern fort with many walls|[[Mortimer Wheeler]] pioneered [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|systematic excavation]] in the early 20th century. Pictured, are his excavations at [[Maiden Castle, Dorset]], in October 1937.]]\nThe first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of [[Hissarlik]], on the site of ancient [[Troy]], carried out by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], [[Frank Calvert]] and [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]] in the 1870s. These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation are studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.\n\n===Archaeometry===\n{{Main|Archaeological science}}\n\n[[Archaeometry]] aims to systematize archaeological measurement. It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering. It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.<ref name=\"Glasscock_et_al1994\"/> Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and [[geodesy]] as well as computer-based tools such as [[geographic information system]] technology.<ref name=\"GIS, critique, representation and beyond\"/> [[Rare earth elements]] patterns may also be used.<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\"/>  A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity.<ref name=\"mit\"/>\n\n===Cultural resources management===\n{{Main|Cultural resources management}}\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2014}}\n\nArchaeology can be a subsidiary activity within [[Cultural resources management]] (CRM), also called [[Cultural heritage management]] (CHM) in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"The University of Exeter - SoGAER - Department of Archaeology\"/> CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development. Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT).

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007.

For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F.

For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement.<ref name=\"Canadian Geographic Online\" />\n\n[[Kennewick Man]] is another repatriation candidate that has been the source of heated debate.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeobiology}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeogenetics}}\n* {{annotated link|Archaeology of religion and ritual}}\n* {{annotated link|Area of archaeological potential}}\n* {{annotated link|Chronological dating}}\n* {{annotated link|Classical archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Dump digging}}\n* {{annotated link|GIS in archaeology}}\n* {{annotated link|Harris matrix}}\n* {{annotated link|Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project}}\n* {{annotated link|Paleoanthropology|Palaeoanthropology}}\n\n'''Lists'''\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological periods}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeological sites by country}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeologists}}\n* {{annotated link|List of archaeology awards}}\n* {{annotated link|List of paleoethnobotanists}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns\">{{Citation |title= An anthropic soil transformation fingerprinted by REY patterns |author1=Saiano, F.  |author2=Scalenghe, R.|year= 2009|volume=36|issue=11|pages=2502\u201306|doi= 10.1016/j.jas.2009.06.025|journal= Journal of Archaeological Science}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\">{{Citation|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html |title=Anthropological Studies Center (ASC) |publisher=Sonoma.edu |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090328003841/http://www.sonoma.edu/asc/roadshow.html| archivedate= 28 March 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"archaeological\">{{citation | author = Schiffer M.

Antiquarians studied [[history]] with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites. Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]], \"We speak from facts not theory\". Tentative steps towards the systematization of archaeology as a [[science]] took place during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]] in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{citation|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/historyofarchaeology/a/history_series.htm|last=Hirst|first=K. Kris|title=The History of Archaeology: How Ancient Relic Hunting Became Science|work=ThoughtCo|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe, philosophical interest in the remains of [[Ancient Greece|Greco]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] civilization and the rediscovery of classical culture began in the late [[Middle Age]]. [[Flavio Biondo]], an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanist]] historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and [[topography of ancient Rome]] in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology. Antiquarians of the 16th century, including [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] and [[William Camden]], conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered.\n\nThe [[OED]] first cites \"archaeologist\" from 1824; this soon took over as the usual term for one major branch of antiquarian activity. \"Archaeology\", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call \"ancient history\" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837.\n\n===First excavations===\n[[File:stonehenge 1877.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=old photograph of stonehenge with toppled stones|An early photograph of [[Stonehenge]] taken July 1877]]\nOne of the first sites to undergo archaeological excavation was [[Stonehenge]] and other [[Megalith|megalithic monuments]] in England. [[John Aubrey]] (1626\u20131697) was a pioneer archaeologist who recorded numerous [[megalith]]ic and other [[Ancient monument|field monuments]] in southern England. He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings. He attempted to chart the chronological stylistic evolution of handwriting, medieval architecture, costume, and shield-shapes.<ref>{{Citation |first=Michael |last=Hunter |authorlink=Michael Hunter (historian) |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |publisher=Duckworth |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7156-0818-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 156\u201357, 162\u201366, 181] |url=https://archive.org/details/johnaubreyrealmo0000hunt/page/156 }}</ref>\n\nExcavations were also carried out by the Spanish military engineer [[Roque Joaqu\u00edn de Alcubierre]] in the ancient towns of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], both of which had been covered by ash during the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. These excavations began in 1748 in Pompeii, while in Herculaneum they began in 1738. The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of [[fresco]]s, had a big impact throughout Europe.\n\nHowever, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as [[Stratification (archaeology)|stratification]] and [[Archaeological context|context]] were overlooked.<ref>[[Dorothy King]], ''The Elgin Marbles'' (Hutchinson, January 2006)</ref>\n\n===Development of archaeological method===\n[[File:Both Lozenges.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Artifacts discovered at the 1808 [[Bush Barrow]] excavation by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]] and [[William Cunnington]].]]\nThe father of archaeological excavation was [[William Cunnington]] (1754\u20131810). He undertook excavations in [[Wiltshire]] from around 1798,<ref>Everill, P. 2010. The Parkers of Heytesbury: Archaeological pioneers. Antiquaries Journal 90: 441\u201353</ref> funded by Sir [[Richard Colt Hoare]]. Cunnington made meticulous recordings of [[Neolithic]] and [[Bronze Age]] [[tumulus|barrows]], and the terms he used to categorize and describe them are still used by archaeologists today.<ref>Everill, P. 2009. Invisible Pioneers. British Archaeology 108: 40\u201343</ref>\n\nOne of the major achievements of 19th-century archaeology was the development of [[stratigraphy]]. The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new [[geology|geological]] and [[palaeontology|paleontological]] work of scholars like [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[James Hutton]] and [[Charles Lyell]]. The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of [[Prehistory|prehistorical]] and [[Bronze Age]] sites. In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like [[Jacques Boucher de Perthes]] and [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]] began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order.\n\nA major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[Augustus Pitt Rivers]],<ref>Bowden, Mark (1984) ''General Pitt Rivers: The father of scientific archaeology''. [[Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum]]. {{ISBN|0-947535-00-4}}.</ref> who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s. His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist. He [[Pitt Rivers Museum|arranged his artifacts]] by type or \"[[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]], and within types by date or \"chronologically\". This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects. His most important methodological innovation was his insistence that ''all'' artifacts, not just beautiful or unique ones, be collected and catalogued.<ref>{{citation|first=Dan|last=Hicks|year=2013|chapter=Characterizing the World Archaeology Collections of the Pitt Rivers Museum|title=World Archaeology at the Pitt Rivers Museum: a characterization|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford|editor1-first=Dan|editor1-last=Hicks|editor2-first=Alice|editor2-last=Stevenson|chapter-url=http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/download.asp?id=%7B64476CB8-7963-40E1-B225-F54DA37A2F9A%7D|isbn=978-1-905739-58-5}}</ref>\n\n[[William Flinders Petrie]] is another man who may legitimately be called the Father of Archaeology. His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" Petrie developed the [[seriation (archaeology)|system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings]], which revolutionized the chronological basis of [[Egyptology]].

These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the [[Hellenistic period]].<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=363| title=Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor| first=Kenneth W.| last=Harl| accessdate=23 November 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the work of Sir [[Arthur Evans]] at [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] revealed the ancient existence of an equally advanced [[Minoan civilization]].<ref>{{citation|first=Joseph Alexander|last=MacGillivray|title=Minotaur: Sir Arthur Evans and the Archaeology of the Minoan Myth|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nThe next major figure in the development of archaeology was Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]], whose highly disciplined approach to excavation and systematic coverage in the 1920s and 1930s brought the science on swiftly. Wheeler developed the [[Wheeler-Kenyon method|grid system of excavation]], which was further improved by his student [[Kathleen Kenyon]].\n\nArchaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools. By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates. Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when [[maritime archaeology]] and [[urban archaeology]] became more prevalent and [[rescue archaeology]] was developed as a result of increasing commercial development.<ref name=\"Renfrew_Bahn1991#5\">Renfrew and Bahn (2004 [1991]:33\u201335)</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\n[[File:Australopithecus africanus - Cast of taung child.jpg|thumb|Cast of the skull of the [[Taung child]], uncovered in [[South Africa]]. The Child was an infant of the ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]'' species, an early form of [[hominin]]]]\nThe purpose of archaeology is to learn more about past societies and the development of the [[human race]]. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within [[prehistory|prehistoric cultures]], who did not make use of [[literacy|writing]], thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5&nbsp;million years ago when we find the first stone tools \u2013 [[Oldowan|The Oldowan Industry]]. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the [[human evolution|evolution of humanity]] during the [[Paleolithic]] period, when the [[hominin]]s developed from the [[australopithecines]] in [[Africa]] and eventually into modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of [[stone tool]]s, the discovery of [[metallurgy]], the beginnings of [[religion]] and the creation of [[agriculture]]. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.<ref name=\"ncl\"/>\n\nHowever, it is not only prehistoric, pre-literate cultures that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of [[historical archaeology]]. For many literate cultures, such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Mesopotamia]], their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the [[elite]] classes, such as the [[clergy]] or the [[bureaucracy]] of court or temple. The literacy even of [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into [[library|libraries]] and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as [[sampling bias]] and [[differential preservation]].<ref name=\"archaeological\"/>\n\nOften, archaeology provides the only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, ''Homo sapiens'' has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of ''Homo'' for millions of years (see [[Human evolution]]). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization \u2013 the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities \u2013 must come from archaeology.\n\nIn addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.\n\nThis view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents ''(see [[Pseudoarchaeology]])''. However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology.\n\n===Theory===\n{{main|Archaeological theory}}\n[[File:Archeologists sign at Lubbock Lake Monument IMG 1591.JPG|upright=0.9|right|thumb|alt=Archaeologists dig in the dirt very carefully so they won't miss anything important. |Sign at [[Lubbock Lake Landmark]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], [[Texas]]]]\n\nThere is no one approach to archaeological theory that has been adhered to by all archaeologists. When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of [[cultural-history archaeology]], which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing [[historical particularism]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], [[Siberia]]ns, [[Mesoamerica]]ns etc.) followed the [[direct historical approach]], compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like [[Lewis Binford]] and [[Kent Flannery]] arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology.<ref name=\"Binford1962\"/><ref name=\"Flannery1967\"/> They proposed a \"New Archaeology\", which would be more \"scientific\" and \"anthropological\", with [[hypothesis]] testing and the [[scientific method]] very important parts of what became known as [[processual archaeology]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, a new [[postmodern]] movement arose led by the British archaeologists [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]],<ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1987\"/><ref name=\"Shanks_Tilley1988\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1991\"/><ref name=\"Shanks1993\"/> [[Christopher Tilley]],<ref name=\"Tilley1993\"/> [[Daniel Miller (anthropologist)|Daniel Miller]],<ref name=\"Miller_Tilley1984\"/><ref name=\"Miller_etal1989\"/> and [[Ian Hodder]],<ref name=\"Hodder1982\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1985\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1987\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1990\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1991\"/><ref name=\"Hodder1992\"/> which has become known as [[post-processual archaeology]]. It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate. Meanwhile, another theory, known as [[historical processualism]] has emerged seeking to incorporate a focus on process and post-processual archaeology's emphasis of reflexivity and history.<ref name=\"Pauketat2001\"/>\n\nArchaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including [[evolution|neo-evolutionary thought]],<ref name=\"Hinshaw2000\"/>[[#cite note-Hinshaw2000-35|<span class=\"mw-reflink-text\">[35]</span>]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[postmodernism]], [[Structure and agency|agency theory]], [[Cognitive archaeology|cognitive science]], [[structural functionalism]], [[Gender archaeology|gender-based]] and [[feminist archaeology]], and [[systems theory in archaeology|systems theory]].\n\n==Methods==\n[[File:Indusketa arkeologikoa.webm|thumb|Video showing the different works in an archaeological recovery and analysis]]\nAn archaeological investigation usually involves several distinct phases, each of which employs its own variety of methods. Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon. This done, a site is [[Archaeological survey|surveyed]] to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area. Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground. And, third, the data collected from the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists. It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected.<ref name=\"renfrew\"/>\n\n===Remote sensing===\nBefore actually starting to dig in a location, [[Remote sensing (archaeology)|remote sensing]] can be used to look where sites are located within a large area or provide more information about sites or regions. There are two types of remote sensing instruments\u2014passive and active. Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene. Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument. Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected. [[Satellite imagery]] is an example of passive remote sensing. Here are two active remote sensing instruments:\n\n'''[[Lidar]]''' (Light Detection and Ranging)\nA lidar uses a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) to transmit a light pulse and a receiver with sensitive detectors to measure the backscattered or reflected light. Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled. Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere.\n\n'''[[Laser altimeter]]'''\nA laser altimeter uses a lidar (see above) to measure the height of the instrument platform above the surface. By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined.\n<ref>{{citation|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/RemoteSensing/|title=Remote Sensing : Feature Articles|first=Graham|last=Steve|date=17 September 1999|publisher=NASA|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Field survey===\n{{main|Archaeological survey}}\n[[File:Monte Alb\u00e1n archeological site, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|[[Monte Alban]] archaeological site]]\nThe archaeological project then continues (or alternatively, begins) with a [[archaeological survey|field survey]]. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and [[midden]]s, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.\n\nSurvey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible [[Feature (archaeology)|features]] there. [[Gordon Willey]] pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the [[Viru Valley]] of coastal [[Peru]],<ref name=\"Willey1953\"/><ref name=\"Willey1968\"/> and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.<ref name=\"Billmand_Feinman1999\"/>\n\nSurvey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] methods.)<ref name=\"Redman1974\"/> As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as [[Human settlement|settlement patterns]] and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into [[map]]s, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution.\n[[File:Archeoscan excavation site.jpg|thumbnail|right|Inverted kite aerial photo of an excavation of a Roman building at Nesley near Tetbury in Gloucestershire.]]\nThe simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as [[auger (drill)|augers]], [[corer]]s, and [[shovel test]] pits. If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed [[sterile deposit|sterile]].\n\n[[Aerial survey]] is conducted using [[camera]]s attached to [[airplane]]s, [[balloon (aircraft)|balloons]], [[UAVs]], or even [[Kite]]s.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.armadale.org.uk/kite03.htm |title=Kite Aerial Photography |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. [[Plant]]s growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as [[midden]]s) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening [[cereal|grain]], which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs [[ultraviolet]], [[infrared]], ground-penetrating [[radar]] wavelengths, [[LiDAR]] and [[thermography]].<ref>{{citation|last=Reeves|first= D.M. |year=1936|title=Aerial photography and archaeology|journal=American Antiquity|volume=2|issue=2|pages= 102\u201307|doi=10.2307/275881|jstor=275881}}</ref>\n\n[[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|Geophysical survey]] can be the most effective way to see beneath the ground. [[Magnetometer]]s detect minute deviations in the [[Earth's magnetic field]] caused by [[iron]] artifacts, [[kiln]]s, some types of [[stone structures]], and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the [[electrical resistivity]] of the soil are also widely used. Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped. Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity.\n\nAlthough some archaeologists consider the use of [[metal detector]]s to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying.<ref>{{citation |last=S\u00e1nchez |first=Rosal\u00eda |title=Para los arque\u00f3logos es un ladr\u00f3n, para los buscadores de tesoros un \u00eddolo |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cultura/2015/02/25/54ee2718ca4741d71a8b457b.html |date=25 February 2015 |access-date=19 December 2017 |newspaper=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |language=es}}</ref> Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on [[English Civil War]] battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the [[Portable Antiquities Scheme]].\n\nRegional survey in [[underwater archaeology]] uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, [[side-scan sonar]], or sub-bottom sonar.<ref>{{citation|last=Hall|first= E.T. |year=1970|title= Survey techniques in underwater archaeology|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as [[stratigraphy]], three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.\n\nModern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their [[provenance]] or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see [[Harris matrix#Harris's Laws of Archaeological Stratigraphy|Primary Laws of Archaeology]]). Likewise, their [[archaeological association|association]], or [[relationship (archaeology)|relationship]] with nearby objects and [[feature (archaeology)|features]], needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce which [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and features were likely used together and which may be from different [[archaeological phase|phases]] of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its [[stratigraphy]]; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.\n\nExcavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms. Also, as a destructive process, it carries [[ethics|ethical]] concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and \"method statement\" issued. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] is even more important in excavation than in survey. Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as [[backhoe]]s ([[J. C. Bamford|JCBs]]), is used in excavation, especially to remove the [[topsoil]] ([[overburden]]), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with [[trowel]]s or [[hoe (tool)|hoes]] to ensure that all features are apparent.\n\nThe next task is to form a [[Archaeological plan|site plan]] and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the [[Archaeological natural|natural subsoil]] are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible [[archaeological section]] for recording. A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the [[Cut (archaeology)|cut]] and the [[Fill (archaeology)|fill]]. The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil. It is the feature's boundary. The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil. The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and [[Single context recording|recording]] sheets are filled in describing the [[Archaeological context|context]] of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{main|Post-excavation analysis}}\n[[File:LuzonensisMolars.jpg|thumb|Five of the seven known fossil teeth of ''[[Homo luzonensis]]'' found in [[Callao Cave]], the [[Philippines]].]]\nOnce artifacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them. This process is known as [[post-excavation analysis]], and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.\n\nAt a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections. This comparison process often involves classifying them [[Typology (archaeology)|typologically]] and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through [[archaeological science]], meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined. Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleoethnobotany]], [[palynology]] and [[stable isotopes]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/10256016.2019.1598986 | pmid=30943760 | volume=55 | issue=3 | title=Is the 'canine surrogacy approach' (CSA) still valid for dogs and humans in market-oriented and subsistence-oriented communities in Brazil? | year=2019 | journal=Isotopes in Environmental and Health Studies | pages=227\u2013236 | author=Luiz Abdalla Filho Adibe, Bielefeld Nardoto Gabriela, de Aro Galera Leonardo, Leite de Souza Janaina, Santos Reis Luiza, Almoza Hernandez Yeleine, Sales Rebeca, Guimar\u00e3es Gerardi Daniel, Antonio Martinelli Luiz}}</ref> while any texts can usually be [[Deciphering|deciphered]].\n\nThese techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.\n\n===Computational and virtual archaeology===\n{{main|Computational archaeology}}\n{{main|Virtual archaeology}}\n[[Computer graphics]] are now used to build virtual [[3D modeling|3D models]] of sites, such as the throne room of an Assyrian palace or ancient Rome.<ref name=\"virt\"/> [[Photogrammetry]] is also used as an analytical tool, and digital [[topography|topographical]] models have been combined with [[astronomy|astronomical]] calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a [[solstice]].<ref name=virt/> [[Agent-based modeling]] and [[Computer simulation|simulation]] can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.

Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in [[western Europe]] as well. In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each [[archaeological site]].\n\nThe application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990, [[PPG 16]]<ref name=\"Planning Policy Guidance 16: Archaeology and planning - Planning, building and the environment - Communities and Local Government\"/> has required planners to consider archaeology as a [[material consideration]] in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the [[polluter pays principle|developer's expense]].\n\nIn England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]<ref name=\"Department for Culture Media and Sport - historic environment\"/> in association with [[English Heritage]].<ref name=\"English Heritage - Stonehenge & the History of England: English Heritage\"/> In [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]], the same responsibilities lie with [[Historic Scotland]],<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/ |title= Historic Scotland |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=5 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090426014641/http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/| archivedate= 26 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> [[Cadw]]<ref name=\"Cadw\"/> and the [[Northern Ireland Environment Agency]]<ref name=\"Built Environment\"/> respectively.\n\nIn France, the [[Institut national du patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology. Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered. The [[curator]] is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public.\n\nAmong the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of [[cultural]] sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely.\n\nCultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate [[State Historic Preservation Office]] (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.\n\nThe annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of [[postdoctoral|post-doc]], temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate. Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with \"strong backs and weak minds,\"<ref name=\"Flannery1982\"/> has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience.\n\n==Popular views of archaeology==\n\n[[File:Beit shean1.jpg|thumb|right|Extensive excavations at [[Beit She'an]], [[Israel]]]]\n[[File:Exhibition in a multi-storey car park on archological discoveries having been made during construction.JPG|thumb|Permanent exhibition in a German [[multi-storey car park]], explaining the archaeological discoveries made during the construction of this building]]\n\nEarly archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities and was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic. The job of archaeologist is depicted as a \"romantic adventurist occupation\".<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\">{{Citation|last=McGeough|first=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in the Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|year=2006|volume=69|issue=3\u20134|pages=174\u201385|doi=10.1086/NEA25067670|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10ec642c63fb8691174749138c5429ce983936e2}}</ref> and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community. Cinema audiences form a notion of \"who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted\",<ref name=\"McGeough 2006 174\u2013185\"/> and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts. The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.\n\nMuch thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as [[Cop\u00e1n]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]], but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational. Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], and [[archaeological data processing|data processing]]. Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as \"[[pseudoarchaeology]]\".<ref name=\"Romancing the Past-Archaeology\"/>\nArchaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.<ref name=\"Denning2004\"/>\n\n==Current issues and controversy==\n\n===Public archaeology===\n[[File:Dolina-Pano-3.jpg|thumb|upright|Excavations at the site of [[Gran Dolina]], in the [[Atapuerca Mountains]], Spain, 2008]]\nMotivated by a desire to halt looting, curb [[#Pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeology]], and to help preserve archaeological sites through education and fostering public appreciation for the importance of archaeological heritage, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns.<ref name=\"Anthropological Studies Center (ASC)\"/> They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting. Common methods of public outreach include press releases, and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.\n\nOne audience for archaeologists' work is the public. They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology. Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} The U.S.Dept. of Agriculture, [[US Forest Service|Forest Service]] (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT). Volunteers work with professional USFS archaeologists and historians on national forests throughout the U.S. Volunteers are involved in all aspects of professional archaeology under expert supervision.<ref name=\"rapidcityjournal\"/>\n\nTelevision programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project<ref>{{citation|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=16 May 2015 }}</ref> integrated a one-hour HD documentary,<ref name=\"Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck\">{{citation|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''<ref>{{citation|url=http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248|title=Live from Morehead City, it's Queen Anne's Revenge :: State Publications}}</ref> educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.<ref>{{citation |author1=C Southerly |author2=J Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (Ed).

Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary [[health and safety]] and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern [[construction|building site]] with tight deadlines. Certain charities and [[local government]] bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial [[training excavations]] and archaeological holiday tours.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nArchaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies, which is one reason why [[Community archaeology]] projects are starting to become more common. Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do.\n\nArchaeological Legacy Institute (ALI), is a registered 501[c] [3] non-profit, media and education corporation registered in Oregon in 1999. ALI founded a website, [http://archaeologychannel.org/ The Archaeology Channel] to support the organization's mission \"to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible.\"<ref name=\"The Archaeology Channel and About Us: Archaeological Legacy Institute\"/>\n\n===Pseudoarchaeology===\n{{Main|Pseudoarchaeology}}\n\n[[Pseudoarchaeology]] is an umbrella term for all activities that falsely claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in [[Post-processual archaeology|post-processualism]].\n\nAn example of this type is the writing of [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]]. His 1968 book, ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. This theory, known as [[palaeocontact theory]], or [[Ancient astronaut theory]], is not exclusively D\u00e4niken's, nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.\n\n===Looting===\n[[File:Looting rontoy2007.jpg|thumb|right|A looter's pit on the morning following its excavation, taken at [[Rontoy]], [[Huaura Valley]], [[Peru]] in June 2007. Several small holes left by looters' prospecting probes can be seen, as well as their footprints.]]\n\n[[Looting]] of archaeological sites is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s were looted during [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]].<ref name=\"civilizations\" /> Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites. The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the [[illicit antiquities]] trade. Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it. Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage. Indigenous peoples especially lose access to and control over their 'cultural resources', ultimately denying them the opportunity to know their past.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" />\n\nIn 1937, W. F. Hodge the Director of the [[Southwest Museum]] released a statement that the museum would no longer purchase or accept collections from looted contexts.<ref name=\"Hodge1937\" /> The first conviction of the transport of artifacts illegally removed from private property under the [http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA; Public Law 96-95; 93 Statute 721]; {{usc|16|470aamm}}) was in 1992 in the State of Indiana.<ref name=\"Munson_et_al1995\" />\n\nArchaeologists trying to protect artifacts may be placed in danger by looters or locals trying to protect the artifacts from archaeologists who are viewed as looters by the locals.<ref>{{Citation|title=Archaeologist's Execution Highlights Risks to History's Guardians|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/150820-syria-archaeologist-isis-protecting-artifacts/|website=National Geographic News|accessdate=21 August 2015|first=Mark|last=Strauss|date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome historical archaeology sites are subjected to looting by [[metal detector]] hobbyists who search for artifacts using increasingly advanced technology. Efforts are underway among all major Archaeological organizations to increase education and legitimate cooperation between amateurs and professionals in the metal detecting community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Open Minds, Clearer Signals \u2013 Metal Detectorist and Archaeologist Cooperation Takes Another Step |url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/04/open-minds-clearer-signals-metal-detectorist-and-archaeologist-cooperation-takes-another-step/ |website=The Society for Historical Archaeology |publisher=The Society for Historical Archaeology|date=10 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhile most looting is deliberate, accidental looting can occur when amateurs, who are unaware of the importance of Archaeological rigor, collect artifacts from sites and place them into private collections.\n\n===Descendant peoples===\nIn the United States, examples such as the case of [[Kennewick Man]] have illustrated the tensions between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and archaeologists, which can be summarized as a conflict between a need to remain respectful toward sacred burial sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present.\n\nAs a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of [[postprocessualism]], some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of [[indigenous peoples]] likely to be descended from those under study.\n\nArchaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.\n\nWhile this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.\n\n====Repatriation====\n:''See [[Repatriation and reburial of human remains]]''\nA new trend in the heated controversy between [[First Nations]] groups and scientists is the [[repatriation]] of native [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] to the original descendants. An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] nations in the [[Ottawa]] area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near [[Maniwaki, Quebec]], to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods\u2014some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.\n\nThe remains and artifacts, including [[jewelry]], [[tool]]s and [[weapons]], were originally excavated from various sites in the [[Ottawa Valley]], including [[Morrison Island|Morrison]] and the [[Allumette Island]]s. They had been part of the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]'s research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional [[Juniperus virginiana|redcedar]] and [[birchbark]] boxes lined with redcedar chips, [[muskrat]] and [[Beaver#Commercial uses|beaver pelts]].\n\nAn inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried. Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible.

The cartoon above is Goldberg's ''Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin'', which was later reprinted in a few book collections, including the postcard book ''Rube Goldberg's Inventions!'' and the hardcover ''Rube Goldberg: Inventions'', both compiled by Maynard Frank Wolfe from the Rube Goldberg Archives.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wolfe | first = Maynard Frank | title = Rube Goldberg: Inventions | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 0684867249 }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Rube Goldberg\" was being used in print to describe elaborate contraptions by 1928,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Atkinson|first1=J.

In ''Ernest Goes to Jail'', Ernest P. Worrell uses his invention simply to turn his TV on. Wallace from ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' creates and uses many such machines for numerous tasks. Other films such as ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'',  ''Diving into the Money Pit'', and \"[[Back To The Future]]\" have featured Goldberg's idea.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[Image:Rube golderg competition.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rube Goldberg machine designers participating in a competition in New Mexico.]]\nIn early 1987, [[Purdue University]] in [[Indiana]] started the annual National [[Rube Goldberg Machine Contest]], organized by the Phi chapter of [[Theta Tau]], a national engineering fraternity. In 2009, the Epsilon chapter of [[Theta Tau]] established a similar annual contest at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nSince around 1997, the [[kinetic art]]ist [[Arthur Ganson]] has been the emcee of the annual \"Friday After Thanksgiving\" (FAT) competition sponsored by the [[MIT Museum]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Teams of contestants construct elaborate Rube Goldberg style chain-reaction machines on tables arranged around a large gy345676543545432534 mnasium.  Each apparatus is linked by a string to its predecessor and successor machine. The initial string is ceremonially pulled, and the ensuing events are videotaped in closeup, and simultaneously projected on large screens for viewing by the live audience. After the entire cascade of events has finished, prizes are then awarded in various categories and age levels. Videos from several previous years' contests are viewable on the MIT Museum website.<ref name=FAT>{{cite web|title=Friday After Thanksgiving: Chain Reaction|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/programs/fat.html|work=MIT Museum [website]|access-date=2011-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Chain Reaction Contraption Contest<ref>[http://www.chainreactioncontest.org/ Chain Reaction Contraption Contest]</ref> is an annual event hosted at the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in which high school teams each build a Rube Goldberg machine to complete some simple task (which changes from year to year) in 20 steps or more (with some additional constraints on size, timing, safety, etc.).\n\nOn the TV show ''[[Food Network Challenge]]'', competitors in 2011 were once required to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of sugar.<ref name=Challenge>{{cite web |title=Food Network Challenge: Sugar Inventions |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/food-network-challenge/12-series/sugar-inventions.html |access-date=2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nAn event called 'Mission Possible'<ref>[http://www.soinc.org/mission_c Mission Possible]</ref> in the [[Science Olympiad]] involves students building a Rube Goldberg-like device to perform a certain series of tasks.\n\nThe Rube Goldberg company holds an annual Rube Goldberg machine contest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rubegoldberg.com/ |title=Rube Goldberg \u2013 Home of the Official Rube Goldberg Machine Contests |website=www.rubegoldberg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==Similar expressions and artists worldwide==\n* Australia\u2014cartoonist [[Bruce Petty]] depicts such themes as the economy, international relations or other social issues as complicated interlocking machines that manipulate, or are manipulated by, people.\n* Austria\u2014[[:de:Weltmaschine des Franz Gsellmann|Franz Gsellmann]] worked for decades on a machine that he named the ''Weltmaschine'' (\"world machine\"),<ref>[http://www.weltmaschine.at/ Die Weltmaschine des Franz Gsellmann].

It is now used mainly among programmers to indicate a complicated program, or in journalism to refer to a bewildering law or regulation (''cf''. [[Stovepipe system]]).\n* Germany\u2014such machines are often called ''Was-passiert-dann-Maschine'' (''\"What happens next machine\"'') for the German name of similar devices used by [[Kermit the Frog]] in the children's TV series ''[[Sesame Street]]''.\n* India\u2014the humorist and children's author [[Sukumar Ray]], in his nonsense poem \"[[Abol tabol]]\", had a character (Uncle) with a Rube Goldberg-like machine called \"Uncle's contraption\"(''khuror kol'').

Another related genre is the [[Japanese art]] of [[chind\u014dgu]], which involves inventions that are hypothetically useful but of limited actual utility.\n* Spain\u2014devices akin to Goldberg's machines are known as ''Inventos del TBO (tebeo)'', named after those that several cartoonists (Nit, T\u00ednez, Marino Benejam, Frances Tur and finally Ram\u00f3n Sabat\u00e9s) made up and drew for a section in the comic book magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'', allegedly designed by some \"Professor Franz\" from Copenhagen in Denmark.\n* Switzerland\u2014[[Peter Fischli & David Weiss]], Swiss artists known for their art installation movie ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (''[[The Way Things Go]]'', 1987). It documents a 30-minute-long causal chain assembled of everyday objects, resembling a Rube Goldberg machine.\n* Turkey\u2014such devices are known as ''Zihni Sinir Projeleri'', allegedly invented by a certain Proffessor Zihni Sinir (\"Crabby Mind\"), a curious scientist character created by \u0130rfan Sayar in 1977 for the cartoon magazine ''[[G\u0131rg\u0131r]]''. The cartoonist later went on to open a studio selling actual working implementations of his designs.\n* United Kingdom\u2014a \"Heath Robinson contraption\", named after the fantastical comic machinery illustrated by British cartoonist and illustrator [[W.

The cartoon above is Goldberg's ''Professor Butts and the Self-Operating Napkin'', which was later reprinted in a few book collections, including the postcard book ''Rube Goldberg's Inventions!'' and the hardcover ''Rube Goldberg: Inventions'', both compiled by Maynard Frank Wolfe from the Rube Goldberg Archives.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wolfe | first = Maynard Frank | title = Rube Goldberg: Inventions | publisher = Simon & Schuster | location = New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 0684867249 }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Rube Goldberg\" was being used in print to describe elaborate contraptions by 1928,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Atkinson|first1=J.

In ''Ernest Goes to Jail'', Ernest P. Worrell uses his invention simply to turn his TV on. Wallace from ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' creates and uses many such machines for numerous tasks. Other films such as ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'',  ''Diving into the Money Pit'', and \"[[Back To The Future]]\" have featured Goldberg's idea.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[Image:Rube golderg competition.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rube Goldberg machine designers participating in a competition in New Mexico.]]\nIn early 1987, [[Purdue University]] in [[Indiana]] started the annual National [[Rube Goldberg Machine Contest]], organized by the Phi chapter of [[Theta Tau]], a national engineering fraternity. In 2009, the Epsilon chapter of [[Theta Tau]] established a similar annual contest at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].\n\nSince around 1997, the [[kinetic art]]ist [[Arthur Ganson]] has been the emcee of the annual \"Friday After Thanksgiving\" (FAT) competition sponsored by the [[MIT Museum]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Teams of contestants construct elaborate Rube Goldberg style chain-reaction machines on tables arranged around a large gymnasium.  Each apparatus is linked by a string to its predecessor and successor machine. The initial string is ceremonially pulled, and the ensuing events are videotaped in closeup, and simultaneously projected on large screens for viewing by the live audience. After the entire cascade of events has finished, prizes are then awarded in various categories and age levels. Videos from several previous years' contests are viewable on the MIT Museum website.<ref name=FAT>{{cite web|title=Friday After Thanksgiving: Chain Reaction|url=http://web.mit.edu/museum/programs/fat.html|work=MIT Museum [website]|access-date=2011-05-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Chain Reaction Contraption Contest<ref>[http://www.chainreactioncontest.org/ Chain Reaction Contraption Contest]</ref> is an annual event hosted at the [[Carnegie Science Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in which high school teams each build a Rube Goldberg machine to complete some simple task (which changes from year to year) in 20 steps or more (with some additional constraints on size, timing, safety, etc.).\n\nOn the TV show ''[[Food Network Challenge]]'', competitors in 2011 were once required to create a Rube Goldberg machine out of sugar.<ref name=Challenge>{{cite web |title=Food Network Challenge: Sugar Inventions |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/food-network-challenge/12-series/sugar-inventions.html |access-date=2015-09-18}}</ref>\n\nAn event called 'Mission Possible'<ref>[http://www.soinc.org/mission_c Mission Possible]</ref> in the [[Science Olympiad]] involves students building a Rube Goldberg-like device to perform a certain series of tasks.\n\nThe Rube Goldberg company holds an annual Rube Goldberg machine contest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rubegoldberg.com/ |title=Rube Goldberg \u2013 Home of the Official Rube Goldberg Machine Contests |website=www.rubegoldberg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>\n\n==Similar expressions and artists worldwide==\n* Australia\u2014cartoonist [[Bruce Petty]] depicts such themes as the economy, international relations or other social issues as complicated interlocking machines that manipulate, or are manipulated by, people.\n* Austria\u2014[[:de:Weltmaschine des Franz Gsellmann|Franz Gsellmann]] worked for decades on a machine that he named the ''Weltmaschine'' (\"world machine\"),<ref>[http://www.weltmaschine.at/ Die Weltmaschine des Franz Gsellmann].

It is now used mainly among programmers to indicate a complicated program, or in journalism to refer to a bewildering law or regulation (''cf''. [[Stovepipe system]]).\n* Germany\u2014such machines are often called ''Was-passiert-dann-Maschine'' (''\"What happens next machine\"'') for the German name of similar devices used by [[Kermit the Frog]] in the children's TV series ''[[Sesame Street]]''.\n* India\u2014the humorist and children's author [[Sukumar Ray]], in his nonsense poem \"[[Abol tabol]]\", had a character (Uncle) with a Rube Goldberg-like machine called \"Uncle's contraption\"(''khuror kol'').

Another related genre is the [[Japanese art]] of [[chind\u014dgu]], which involves inventions that are hypothetically useful but of limited actual utility.\n* Spain\u2014devices akin to Goldberg's machines are known as ''Inventos del TBO (tebeo)'', named after those that several cartoonists (Nit, T\u00ednez, Marino Benejam, Frances Tur and finally Ram\u00f3n Sabat\u00e9s) made up and drew for a section in the comic book magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'', allegedly designed by some \"Professor Franz\" from Copenhagen in Denmark.\n* Switzerland\u2014[[Peter Fischli & David Weiss]], Swiss artists known for their art installation movie ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (''[[The Way Things Go]]'', 1987). It documents a 30-minute-long causal chain assembled of everyday objects, resembling a Rube Goldberg machine.\n* Turkey\u2014such devices are known as ''Zihni Sinir Projeleri'', allegedly invented by a certain Proffessor Zihni Sinir (\"Crabby Mind\"), a curious scientist character created by \u0130rfan Sayar in 1977 for the cartoon magazine ''[[G\u0131rg\u0131r]]''.

But his lie was soon discovered and Parshurama cursed him. \n\nAfter that [[Duryodhana]] made him the king of [[Anga]] and befriended him. Later, he along with [[Shakuni]], devised a plan to insult [[Draupadi]], wife of Pandavas. They arranged a gambling where [[Yudhishthir]] lost all of his properties including Draupadi. Duryodhana asked Dushasan to disrobe her but failed as Lord Krishna saved her dignity. Pandavas and Draupadi were sent for an exile of 13 years. This sowed the seeds of Mahabharata war.\n\n[[Indra]], in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Later, he came to know about his true identity of Kunti and Surya's son but he decided to fight for Duryodhana blaming Yudhishthir for owing Draupadi. Mahabharata war resulted in the death of Karna, Bheeshma, Drona, Kauravas. Thus, Pandavas won the war. Yudhishthir was made the king of [[Hastinapura]]. \n\n[[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]] cursed Krishna for destroying Kuru Vansh. Her curse showed result after 36 years and Krishna's dynasty also got destroyed. A hunter named Jara killed Krishna mistakenly.

Kunti thus abandoned him. He was then saved by [[Adhirath]], who was a charioteer. Karna since his childhood only decided to became her archer. He learnt archery from Lord [[Parshurama]] and lied him about his identity of being a brahmin. But his lie was soon discovered and Parshurama cursed him. \n\nAfter that [[Duryodhana]] made him the king of [[Anga]] and befriended him. Later, he along with [[Shakuni]], devised a plan to insult [[Draupadi]], wife of Pandavas. They arranged a gambling where [[Yudhishthir]] lost all of his properties including Draupadi. Duryodhana asked Dushasan to disrobe her but failed as Lord Krishna saved her dignity. Pandavas and Draupadi were sent for an exile of 13 years. This sowed the seeds of Mahabharata war.\n\n[[Indra]], in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Later, he came to know about his true identity of Kunti and Surya's son but he decided to fight for Duryodhana blaming Yudhishthir for owing Draupadi. Mahabharata war resulted in the death of Karna, Bheeshma, Drona, Kauravas. Thus, Pandavas won the war. Yudhishthir was made the king of [[Hastinapura]]. \n\n[[Gandhari]] cursed Krishna for destroying Kuru Vansh. Her curse showed result after 36 years and Krishna's dynasty also got destroyed. A hunter named Jara killed Krishna mistakenly. Thus, Pandavas decided to go to heaven where they met Kauravas and Karna.

created for [[Disney+]] by Malcolm Spellman, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] characters [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. The events of the series take place after the 2019 film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], with Spellman serving as [[head writer]] and [[Kari Skogland]] directing.\n\n[[Anthony Mackie]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] reprise their roles as Falcon and Winter Soldier, respectively, from the film series. [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]], [[Emily VanCamp]], and [[Wyatt Russell]] also star. As of September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of limited series for Disney+, centered on supporting characters from the MCU films, with Spellman hired to write one on Falcon and Winter Soldier in October. The series was officially confirmed in April 2019 along with Mackie and Stan's involvement. Skogland was hired the next month. Filming began in October 2019 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to premiere in August 2020, and will consist of six episodes. It will be the first series in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU.\n\n==Premise==\nAfter being handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] teams up with [[Bucky Barnes]] in a worldwide adventure that puts their abilities to the test.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"Synopsis\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]]: <br />An [[Avengers (comics)|Avenger]] and a former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescueman]] who was trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> Wilson was handed the mantle of [[Captain America]] by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] at the end of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> but continues to use the Falcon moniker.<ref name=\"NotCalledCap\" /> The series explores Wilson's actions after receiving [[Captain America's shield]].<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" />\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]]: <br />An enhanced soldier and Rogers' best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought [[killed in action]] during World War II.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n* [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] as [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]:<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> <br />A Sokovian terrorist who was responsible for the Avengers' breakup in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /><ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" /> Zemo wears his traditional purple mask from the comics in the series, which he was not depicted with in ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"ZemoReturnImages\" />\n* [[Emily VanCamp]] as [[Sharon Carter]]: <br />A former agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[Peggy Carter]]'s niece.<ref name=\"D232019\" /> VanCamp said that Carter has been on the run since she was last seen in ''Civil War'', and the series would show what she has been doing in that time.<ref name=\"VanCampExplain\" />\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]]<!--Do NOT add \"U.S. Agent\" as he has not been called such by Marvel Studios-->: A militaristic successor to Captain America created by the U.S. government.<ref name=\"D232019\" /><ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Adepero Oduye]],<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> [[Desmond Chiam]], [[Miki Ishikawa]],<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]],<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and [[Carl Lumbly]] have been cast in undisclosed roles.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#814140 |overall= |title= |director= |directorR=<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> |writer= |airdate= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = [[Kari Skogland]]\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|8}}<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" />\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n{{^|Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = \n |DirectedBy = Kari Skogland\n |WrittenBy = \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020}}\n |ShortSummary = \n |LineColor = 814140\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nBy September 2018, [[Marvel Studios]] was developing several limited series for its parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s streaming service, [[Disney+]], to be centered on supporting characters from the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|Marvel Cinematic Universe films]] who had not starred in their own films. The actors who portrayed the characters in the films were expected to reprise their roles for the limited series. The series were expected to be six to eight episodes each and have a \"hefty [budget] rivaling those of a major studio production\". The series would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than [[Marvel Television]], who produced [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|previous television series in the MCU]]. Marvel Studios President [[Kevin Feige]] was believed to be taking a \"hands-on role\" in each series' development,<ref name=\"Disney+SeriesSep2018\" /> focusing on \"continuity of story\" with the films and \"handling\" the actors who would be reprising their roles from the films.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" />\n\nMalcolm Spellman was hired to write a limited series that would focus on [[Anthony Mackie]]'s [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] and [[Sebastian Stan]]'s [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]] at the end of October 2018.<ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier\" /><ref name=\"FalconWinterSoldier2\" /> Mackie and Stan had both previously expressed interest in starring in an MCU spin-off film together, with Stan comparing the potential idea to [[Buddy film|buddy comedy films]] like ''[[Midnight Run]]'' (1988) and ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"ScarletWitchVision\" /> Marvel and Disney officially announced the series in April 2019, with the title ''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, the miniseries was confirmed to consist of six episodes, and [[Kari Skogland]] was hired to direct.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Budgets for each episode were reported to be as much as $25&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Budgets\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe series picks up following the ending of the film ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), which depicts [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] bequeathing his [[Captain America's shield|shield]] and the mantle of [[Captain America]] to Wilson.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> [[Derek Kolstad]] joined the series' writing team in July 2019,<ref name=\"Kolstad\" /> and said he would be bringing \"a wink and a nod\" to the style of world building and character development from his film franchise ''[[John Wick]]''.<ref name=\"KolstadJohnWick\" /> Kolstad added that the series would explore reactions to a black man becoming Captain America.<ref name=\"KolstadBlackCap\" /> Spellman wanted to \"go home\" with the characters and let the actors show their skills rather than simply focus on action in the series.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Sebastian Stan & Anthony Mackie (48469219356).jpg|thumb|Stan and Mackie at the 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] promoting the series]]\nWith the official announcement of the series in April 2019 came confirmation that Mackie and Stan would reprise their roles of Wilson and Barnes, respectively, in the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> The next month, [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]] and [[Emily VanCamp]] entered negotiations to reprise their film roles of [[Helmut Zemo]] and [[Sharon Carter]], respectively.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> Br\u00fchl was confirmed for the series in July 2019,<ref name=\"ComicCon2019\" /> and VanCamp was confirmed a month later when [[Wyatt Russell]] was announced to be cast in the series as [[U.S. Agent (character)|John Walker]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> Set photos in November 2019 revealed [[Adepero Oduye]] would appear in the series,<ref name=\"OduyeSetPhoto\" /> while [[Desmond Chiam]] and [[Miki Ishikawa]] joined the cast a month later.<ref name=\"ChiamIshikawaCast\" /> [[Noah Mills]] was cast in January 2020,<ref name=\"MillsCast\" /> and the following month, [[Carl Lumbly]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"LumblyCast\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming began on October 31, 2019,<ref name=\"SpellmanFilmingStart\" /> at [[Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]],<ref name=\"F&WSFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MackieMensHealth\" /> with Skogland directing.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /> The series is filmed under the working title ''Tag Team''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> Mackie and Stan announced the official start of filming on November 4.<ref name=\"FilmingStartOfficial\" /> Location shooting took place in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] from November through February 2020.<ref name=\"AtlantaNov2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaDec2019\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaJan2020\" /><ref name=\"AtlantaFeb2020\" />\n\nIn mid-January 2020, filming was expected to take place in [[Arecibo, Puerto Rico]] for two weeks. However, because of [[2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes|earthquakes on the island]], production was suspended. Reporting on this news, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' stated that it was unclear if the location would still be used for filming.<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> On March 3, the production was revealed to be moving to [[Prague, Czech Republic]] for three weeks until March 25,<ref name=\"Prague\" /> with filming in the city starting on March 6 and expected to continue until the week of March 16. However, filming stopped on March 10 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]] and members of the production returned to Atlanta. ''Deadline Hollywood'' noted that it seemed unlikely that the production would return to Prague at that point.<ref name=\"PragueHalted\" /> Later in March, Stan revealed that filming had not been completed, but planned to be once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"StanFilmingUpdate\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nConcept art for the series featuring designs for the characters' costumes are included in ''Expanding the Universe'', a Marvel Studios special that debuted on Disney+ on November 12, 2019.<ref name=\"ExpandingUniverse\" /> In December, Feige debuted the first images from the series at [[Comic Con Experience]]. Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] described these as more grounded than fellow Disney+ series ''[[WandaVision]]'', which was also promoted at the event, with a \"standard spy thriller\" look similar to the ''Captain America'' films that the title characters were introduced in.<ref name=\"CCXP2019\" /> A commercial for the series, ''WandaVision'', and ''[[Loki (TV series)|Loki]]'' was shown during [[Super Bowl LIV]].<ref name=\"SuperBowlSpot\" /> Julia Alexander of ''[[The Verge]]'' said the footage \"wasn't much\" but offered \"enough glimpses to tease fans\".<ref

about\".<ref name=\"ColliderSuperBowlSpot\" />\n\n==Release==\n''The Falcon and the Winter Soldier'' is scheduled to debut in August 2020 on [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"ReleaseMonth\" /> and will consist of six episodes to be released weekly rather than all at once.<ref name=\"Skogland\" /><ref name=\"EpisodeRelease\" /> It will be the first series released in [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase
