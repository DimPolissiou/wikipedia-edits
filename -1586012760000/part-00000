Dexter continues to act on the urge to kill, but the strain of his double life affects both his job at Miami Metro Police and his home life. Rita becomes upset that Dexter appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old waterfront condo where he has stashed his blood drop trophies, and their marriage goes through troubling times.\n\nAs the police investigate a series of small-time crimes and killings in the so-called \"Vacation Murders\" with the help of investigative journalist [[List of Dexter characters#Christine Hill|Christine Hill]], retired FBI [[Special Agent]] [[List of Dexter characters#Frank Lundy|Frank Lundy]] returns to Miami; [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] initially worries he has come back to get closer to her, but he later reveals that he is following a case that the FBI refused to handle. The \"Trinity Killer\", believed to be an older Caucasian male, kills three people in the same city roughly once each year and in a specific sequence: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling, and a father bludgeoned. The first two of this pattern have recently happened in Miami, and Lundy believes he knows when and where the last will be, but he is powerless to act on this. After rekindling their relationship, both Lundy and Debra are shot by an unknown assailant; Debra survives but Lundy's wounds are fatal, and the police initially assume that this was another random killing committed by the \"Vacation Murderer\".\n\nDexter learns of Lundy's analysis, steals his records, and uses his own skills to sneak into the building and catch sight of the Trinity Killer in the act of dispatching his third victim. Dexter follows the killer to his home, and is very surprised to learn that he is [[Arthur Mitchell (character)|Arthur Mitchell]]: husband and father, deacon at a local church, and leader of the \"Four Walls One Heart\" homebuilding charity organization. Dexter continues to watch him and comes to admire his ability to balance his killings along with his family and work lives. Using the alias \"Kyle Butler\", Dexter joins Arthur's church, befriends him, and learns from him how to improve his own relationship with Rita and his family, giving over his condo to Debra while transferring his killing implements into a shed behind their house. Meanwhile, the Miami police learn that the Trinity Killer places a small amount of cremation ashes at each murder scene, and identify that Trinity and the ash share similar genetics but otherwise cannot match Trinity to any criminal records.\n\nArthur takes Dexter on a weekend trip to Tampa, taking him to the house in which he grew up. This is where he, at age ten, saw his older sister die after he inadvertently surprised her in the bathroom; she fell through the glass shower door and severed her [[femoral artery]], killing her almost immediately. This drove his mother to suicide and his father to be abusive, eventually forcing Arthur to kill him. Arthur's trauma is analogous to the event that transformed Dexter and his brother into killers. Dexter later stops Arthur from trying to commit suicide. Dexter discovers that the Trinity series represents the deaths of Arthur's sister, mother and father, and that Arthur has likely been using the Four Walls One Heart program to cover his tracks. Dexter discovers that Arthur's home life is not as pleasant as it appeared, as Arthur abuses his son and locks his daughter in her bedroom, and when things get violent at Thanksgiving dinner, Dexter is forced to subdue Arthur to prevent him from hurting his family. Now assured of Arthur's guilt, Dexter begins to make plans to kill him.\n\nDebra recovers from her wound but Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|LaGuerta]] removes her from the case because of Debra's personal involvement. Still obsessed with solving Lundy's murder, Debra notices that the angle of her wound indicates that the shooter cannot be as tall as Trinity is believed to be. Trace evidence determines that Christine is genetically similar to Trinity and is Arthur Mitchell's illegitimate child. She has been following her father around in an effort to try to clean up after his killings, and so took it on herself to shoot Lundy and Debra when they got too close to Trinity's next target. After Arthur rejects her, Christine kills herself after confessing to the crime in front of Debra. With information collected from Christine, the police start to narrow down the list of possible suspects for Trinity, and Dexter realizes he needs to move fast to get him before the police do.\n\nDexter follows Arthur around but is surprised when he abducts a young boy from a family at an arcade. Dexter goes back to find that Lundy has missed this part of Arthur's pattern: each Trinity series was preceded, five days before, by the abduction of a ten-year-old child \u2013 and since the bodies were never found, they were not recorded as killings. With the help of Arthur's son [[List of Dexter characters#Jonah Mitchell|Jonah]], Dexter tracks down a bomb shelter at a vacant home where Arthur had stowed the child, and is able to stop Arthur from drowning the boy in cement at a nearby Four Walls One Heart construction site. But Arthur gets away. Dexter, as \"Kyle\", blackmails Arthur with the threat of exposing him as a [[pedophile]], as a way to meet Arthur in secret. Instead, Arthur tries to find and kill \"Kyle\", in the process killing an innocent with the same name. Arthur then tricks Dexter to reveal himself, follows him back to the police station where they confront each other and he learns Dexter's true identity.\n\nThus revealed, Dexter tails Arthur to a bank parking lot. He drugs him and prepares to take him elsewhere but, having sideswiped another car during the pursuit, he is confronted and taken to jail. Dexter is shortly released, but finds that Arthur has disappeared. Dexter arranges a getaway for Rita and his children to the Florida Keys as a means to protect them from Arthur, promising to meet them later in the day. Dexter eventually finds Arthur, chokes him until he faints, and takes him to the same bomb shelter to kill him. After disposing of the evidence, Dexter returns home, and finds a voice mail from Rita. He proceeds to call her back, but is surprised to hear her phone ringing in the house.

Dexter continues to act on the urge to kill, but the strain of his double life affects both his job at Miami Metro Police and his home life. Rita becomes upset that Dexter appears to be lying to her, including keeping his old waterfront condo where he has stashed his blood drop trophies, and their marriage goes through troubling times.\n\nAs the police investigate a series of small-time crimes and killings in the so-called \"Vacation Murders\" with the help of investigative journalist [[List of Dexter characters#Christine Hill|Christine Hill]], retired FBI [[Special Agent]] [[List of Dexter characters#Frank Lundy|Frank Lundy]] returns to Miami; [[Debra Morgan|Debra]] initially worries he has come back to get closer to her, but he later reveals that he is following a case that the FBI refused to handle. The \"Trinity Killer\", believed to be an older Caucasian male, kills three people in the same city roughly once each year and in a specific sequence: one young woman killed in a bathtub, a mother killed by falling, and a father bludgeoned. The first two of this pattern have recently happened in Miami, and Lundy believes he knows when and where the last will be, but he is powerless to act on this. After rekindling their relationship, both Lundy and Debra are shot by an unknown assailant; Debra survives but Lundy's wounds are fatal, and the police initially assume that this was another random killing committed by the \"Vacation Murderer\".\n\nDexter learns of Lundy's analysis, steals his records, and uses his own skills to sneak into the building and catch sight of the Trinity Killer in the act of dispatching his third victim. Dexter follows the killer to his home, and is very surprised to learn that he is [[Arthur Mitchell (character)|Arthur Mitchell]]: husband and father, deacon at a local church, and leader of the \"Four Walls One Heart\" homebuilding charity organization. Dexter continues to watch him and comes to admire his ability to balance his killings along with his family and work lives. Using the alias \"Kyle Butler\", Dexter joins Arthur's church, befriends him, and learns from him how to improve his own relationship with Rita and his family, giving over his condo to Debra while transferring his killing implements into a shed behind their house. Meanwhile, the Miami police learn that the Trinity Killer places a small amount of cremation ashes at each murder scene, and identify that Trinity and the ash share similar genetics but otherwise cannot match Trinity to any criminal records.\n\nArthur takes Dexter on a weekend trip to Tampa, taking him to the house in which he grew up. This is where he, at age ten, saw his older sister die after he inadvertently surprised her in the bathroom; she fell through the glass shower door and severed her [[femoral artery]], killing her almost immediately. This drove his mother to suicide and his father to be abusive, eventually forcing Arthur to kill him. Arthur's trauma is analogous to the event that transformed Dexter and his brother into killers. Dexter later stops Arthur from trying to commit suicide. Dexter discovers that the Trinity series represents the deaths of Arthur's sister, mother and father, and that Arthur has likely been using the Four Walls One Heart program to cover his tracks. Dexter discovers that Arthur's home life is not as pleasant as it appeared, as Arthur abuses his son and locks his daughter in her bedroom, and when things get violent at Thanksgiving dinner, Dexter is forced to subdue Arthur to prevent him from hurting his family. Now assured of Arthur's guilt, Dexter begins to make plans to kill him.\n\nDebra recovers from her wound but Lieutenant [[Maria LaGuerta|LaGuerta]] removes her from the case because of Debra's personal involvement. Still obsessed with solving Lundy's murder, Debra notices that the angle of her wound indicates that the shooter cannot be as tall as Trinity is believed to be. Trace evidence determines that Christine is genetically similar to Trinity and is Arthur Mitchell's illegitimate child. She has been following her father around in an effort to try to clean up after his killings, and so took it on herself to shoot Lundy and Debra when they got too close to Trinity's next target. After Arthur rejects her, Christine kills herself after confessing to the crime in front of Debra. With information collected from Christine, the police start to narrow down the list of possible suspects for Trinity, and Dexter realizes he needs to move fast to get him before the police do.\n\nDexter follows Arthur around but is surprised when he abducts a young boy from a family at an arcade. Dexter goes back to find that Lundy has missed this part of Arthur's pattern: each Trinity series was preceded, five days before, by the abduction of a ten-year-old child \u2013 and since the bodies were never found, they were not recorded as killings. With the help of Arthur's son [[List of Dexter characters#Jonah Mitchell|Jonah]], Dexter tracks down a bomb shelter at a vacant home where Arthur had stowed the child, and is able to stop Arthur from drowning the boy in cement at a nearby Four Walls One Heart construction site. But Arthur gets away. Dexter, as \"Kyle\", blackmails Arthur with the threat of exposing him as a [[pedophile]], as a way to meet Arthur in secret. Instead, Arthur tries to find and kill \"Kyle\", in the process killing an innocent with the same name. Arthur then tricks Dexter to reveal himself, follows him back to the police station where they confront each other and he learns Dexter's true identity.\n\nThus revealed, Dexter tails Arthur to a bank parking lot. He drugs him and prepares to take him elsewhere but, having sideswiped another car during the pursuit, he is confronted and taken to jail. Dexter is shortly released, but finds that Arthur has disappeared. Dexter arranges a getaway for Rita and his children to the Florida Keys as a means to protect them from Arthur, promising to meet them later in the day. Dexter eventually finds Arthur, chokes him until he faints, and takes him to the same bomb shelter to kill him. After disposing of the evidence, Dexter returns home, and finds a voice mail from Rita. He proceeds to call her back, but is surprised to hear her phone ringing in the house. Hearing baby Harrison's cries, he races to the bathroom to find Arthur's last victim, Rita, dead in the bathtub, and Harrison bawling in the pool of blood on the floor.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n*[[Michael C.

It was founded by Gurak, off-shooting from the [[Kamarupa Kingdom|Kamarupa Empire]]'s [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in 630 AD. The Kings of Gour are described as patrons of [[Hinduism|Hindu revivalism]] in what was previously a predominantly Buddhist and animist populated land. The 11th century king, Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva is recognised for introducing the ''navadinga'' (nine war boats) and heavily improving the kingdom's infantry, cavalry, and elephant power.<ref name=gupta/> Due to familial tensions, the kingdom split into two separate kingdoms in 1170; '''Gour''' (Northern Sylhet) and '''Brahmachal''' (Southern Sylhet), before being reunited by [[Raja Govardhan]] in the early years of his reign. However, this would be short-lasted as during Govardhan's reign, the kingdom would suffer attacks from neighbouring kingdoms of all directions; eventually leading to the latter's death and the annexation of Brahmachal from Gour to [[Twipra Kingdom|Twipra]]. [[Gour Govinda]] would be the last king to succeed him. In contrast to Govardhan, he would revive Gour back into a regional superpower, warding off all potential enemies, regaining lost territory, introducing defensive strategies like [[archery]] in war for the first time in [[Bengal]]'s history and improving Gour's military status.<ref name=potro/> Noted as a disrespectful and intolerant tyrant, Gour Govinda oppressed religious minorities living in his kingdom, in particular the followers of [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and certain [[Hindu denominations]]. The kingdom came to an end after the Islamic [[conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303 led by [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and [[Shah Jalal]], leading to the flight of Govinda and the royal family, and the subsequent incorporation of Sylhet with mainland Muslim [[Bengal]] ruled by Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firuz Shah]].<ref name=\"Session1980\">{{cite book|author=North East India History Association.

Some say that the name originated from the kingdom's founder; Gurak, the son of Raja Guhak just as Jaintia was named after Jayantak and [[Laur Kingdom|Laur]] after Ladduk. Other theories are that it was named following the 1170 partition of the kingdom into two. The north was renamed Gour (also transliterated as Gauda in [[Sanskrit]]) as in imitation of the great Hindu [[Gauda Kingdom]] which ruled [[Bengal]] from 590AD to 626AD.<ref name=back/>\n\n==Location and origin==\nThe kingdom consisted of majority of the modern-day [[Sylhet District]]. It included some eastern parts of the modern-day [[Moulvibazar District]] until it split from Gour to become the independent kingdom of Brahmachal. The final king of Gour, [[Gour Govinda]] would reunite Brahmachal to the Gour Kingdom. The [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal kingdom]], to its southwest, was  a vassal state of Gour, and later Brahmachal would be one as well. With Govinda turning Gour into a regional superpower, the [[Laur Kingdom]] may have also been a vassal state as Takerghat (in Laur) was made the naval headquarters during Govinda's rule. In the 850s, much of the kingdom's territory was described to be \"outside the pale of human habitation\" with central and southwestern Sylhet forming a large sea.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal|publisher=Indian Studies: Past & Present|year=1967|last=Niyogi|first=Puspa|page=41}}</ref> This explains the naval significance which the Kings of Gour boasted.<ref>{{cite journal|first=K. N.|last=Gupta|title=On Some Castes and Caste-Origins in Sylhet|journal=Indian Historical Quarterly 7|year=1931|pages=725\u201326}}</ref>\n\nThe early rulers of Gour were said to have belonged to an animist clan known as the Pator-Chutia or Patro which later converted to [[Hinduism]] after Raja Guhak's interest in the religion and his initial invitation to Brahmins from Kamarupa to come and migrate to Sylhet. The small tribe remains in existence today and are also known by their endonym, the Laleng, and claim descent from these kings. Their traditions are a mixture of tribal animistic and Hindu beliefs. They have a distinct language to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] and many migrated to [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]] following the 1947 [[Partition of India]] and 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Patra, The|author=Khan, Sadat Ullah}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|thumb|[[Xuanzang]] was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled to Sheelachatal (Sylhet) in the seventh century.]]\nBefore the establishment of the Gour Kingdom, the area was a part of [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintia]] in the greater [[Kamarupa Kingdom]]. When Guhak ascended the Jaintia throne, he married a princess from Kamarupa. Guhak had a deep interest in [[Hinduism]] and migration of [[Brahmins]] from the [[Kamrup region]] to this area took place. On his way back, Guhak brought a stone image known as ''Kangsa-Nisudhana'', an image of [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] murdering [[Kamsa]], as well as Grivakali and Janghakali, and they put it on top of a hill in modern-day where they would worship it. During the British colonial period, this hill was also home to the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow.<ref name=back/>\n\nGuhak had three sons; Jayantak, Gurak and Ladduk, and two daughters; Sheela and Chatala. It is said that his eldest daughter, Sheela, was once bathing in a lake south of the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule) and she was kidnapped. After being rescued by Guhak, Sheela started to become more religious and live a secluded life. Chatala indulged herself in an unlawful relationship with one of the palace servants, leading to her being disowned and dumped in a distant island in the middle of 2000 square mile lake to the south of the kingdom. After Sheela's death at a young age, Guhak gave up his kingdom to also lead a more ascetic life. This port-area around the lake, which was the largest centre in the Jaintia Kingdom for trade, was named Sheela [[haat]] (or Sheela's marketplace) in her honour. Sources such as the Hattanath Tales mention Sheelachatal was named after both daughters for the region.<ref name=fazlur/> This is one of many theories of how [[Sylhet]] got its name.<ref>see [[Names of Sylhet]]</ref> [[Xuanzang]] of [[China]] mentions that he visited Sheelachatal in the 630s in his book, the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]''. He split the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] into three for his three sons. He gave his eldest son, Jayantak, what would become the hilly [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. He gave his second son, Gurak, the southern plains which would be named Gour, and he gave his third son, Luddak, the western plains which would become the [[Laur Kingdom]].<ref name=pak/>\n\nGurak made the capital initially at Borchola, 5 miles northwest of modern-day [[Sylhet]], but moved it to Malini stream bank, 7 miles south of Sylhet. He appointed Marbel as his chief minister. The minister was stationed in a hillock (now known as [[Mona Rai]]'s Tila) near [[Sylhet|the port]] for ease in tax collection and civil duties.<ref name=back>{{cite book|first=Rajmohan|last=Nath|title=The back-ground of Assamese culture|pages=113|url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.34829/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1948|publisher=A. K. Nath|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Mass migration period===\nBeing separated from [[Kamarupa]] by the [[Jaintia Kingdom]], Gour started interacting more with the Hindu lands to its west such as Tripura and Prayagraj. Minister Marbel was ordered to find a wife for Gurak's son, Srihasta. He went south to the [[Twipra Kingdom]] in eastern Bengal where he found a young princess for Srihasta. When Srihasta ascended the throne in 660, he too contributed to the increase of [[Hindu]] influence to the predominantly [[Tantric Buddhist]] and animist-populated land. He installed a stone [[Shivalingam]], which he called Bateshwar Shiva, in modern-day Bondor Bazar which he obtained during a pilgrimage to [[Akshayavat]] in [[Prayagraj]]. It is said he did this to compete with the Buddhist Lokenath statue which a group of merchants installed in modern-day Kazir Bazar. Gour also bordered Bengal to the west which was ruled by the Buddhist [[Pala Empire]]. The Buddhist and later Muslim rule in Bengal led to large numbers of [[Hindus]] to migrate to Gour, which was considered a Hindu stronghold. Srihasta's reign ended in 690 AD and he was succeeded by Kritti Pal. The names of the four kings who succeeded Kritti Pal is unknown until 870 AD, when Bhut Vishnudeva ascends the throne as the 7th king of Gour. He was known to have been [[Muteness|mute]]. He was succeeded by Navagirvan Deva (also known as Ananta Deva Navagirvanta), Gokul Kishore Deva, and then Nara Narayan Deva.\n\nThe 11th King of Gour was Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. He became king in 990 AD after the death of Narayan Deva. He is considered to be one of the greatest kings of Gour. In 1027, he constructed a towering stone [[Krishna]] temple on the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule).<ref name=eaton/> A famed patron of [[Hinduism]], he hosted hundreds of [[Brahmins]] and [[Vedic scholar]]s from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and other parts of [[the subcontinent]], employing them upon the services of temples in his kingdom.<ref name=pak/><ref name=fazlur>{{cite book|title=Sile\u1e6der m\u0101\u1e6di, Sile\u1e6der m\u0101nush|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|page=33|year=1991|publisher=MA Sattar}}</ref> They were given thousands of acres of land each in over hundreds of villages across the kingdom.

They built nine ships (''navadinga''), some being two-storied and with up to 120 oars. These boats; Chali, Hali, Jilkar, Hakaluka, Makarasya, Chatali, Damuria, Barua and Baral are said to be what the modern-day [[haor]]s of Sylhet take their names from.

After invading the kingdom of Kuchunia to his north ruled by Uraj Mardan, he also married Mardan's daughter Chandana and had a son with her named Ishan Deva. After the death of [[Srichandra]] of eastern Bengal's [[Chandra dynasty]], Kesava took advantage and conquered the southern parts of the [[Sylhet region]]; extending the Gour kingdom south of the [[Kushiyara River]].<ref name=pak>{{cite book|title=East Pakistan District Gazetteers: Sylhet|year=1970|publisher=East Pakistan Government Press}}</ref>\n\nKesava's reign ended in 1040, leaving behind three sons; Jadava Kesava, Kangsa Narayan and Ishan Deva. The elder son, Jadava was meant to be king though he was said to have been childless and diseased, and so his brother, Kangsa Narayan became the next king instead. Kangsa established a [[satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|satra]] in the memory of his father, and dug Kamala Lake in memory of his mother, Kamala. Kangsa's rule was very short as he was killed by a wild elephant at a young age. His newly-wed and pregnant wife, Kalavati, a princess from [[Bihar]], became the queen regent with Prince Ishan Deva, General Viradatta and Minister Vanamali Kar managing the kingdom. Kalavati gave birth to a son who was named Pravir Deva. To celebrate Pravir's birth, Ishan installed the [[Madhu-Kaitabha]]ri Temple - which contained an image of [[Vishnu]] - on a hillock now known as Manik Pir's hill.<ref name=fazlur/> The installation ceremony was conducted by a group of [[Brahmins]] and they were rewarded by the administration by receiving excessive land grants in the kingdom. Pravir Deva became the Raja of Gour when he reached a mature age in 1080 AD. He had a son named Bhujavir.\n\n===Partition===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Brahmachal infiltration\n| date       = 1253\n| place      = Brahmachal palace (Baramchal, [[Kulaura]])\n| territory  = [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] re-annexed to Gour\n| result     = Amar Singh replaces Upananda as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = [[Brahmachal Kingdom]]\n----\n{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Twipra Kingdom]] (''defector'')\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n| commander2 = '''Raja Upananda'''{{KIA}}\n* Commander [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] (''defector'')\n* Minister (name unknown)\n* [[Jaidev Rai]] (minister's son)\n----{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]] (''defector'')\n| }}\nIn 1140 AD, after the death of Bhujavir Deva, his son Kshetra Pal ascended the throne. Raja Kshetra Pal also practised [[polygyny]] and had two wives; Ratnavati and Surama. During his reign, an earthquake took place which changed the country's contour and topography. It is said that a new river emerged in the town, which the King named after his second and favourite wife, Rani Surama, as the [[Surma River]]. The King's first son came from Surama and his name was Brahmajit. A few years later, Kshetra's first wife Ratnavati also gave birth to a son, called Dharmadhwaj. However, conspiracies emerged in the country as a number of people were suspicious of Ratnavati accusing her of jealousy and child illegitimacy as Kshetra was an old man by this time. After Kshetra died, his eldest son, Brahmajit stepped to the throne. His stepmother Ratnavati and her associates gave Brahmajit a hard time as she believed that as she was the elder wife, her son should have been the King.\n\nScared for his life, Brahmajit moved his capital to a place known as Brahmachal (now Baramchal, [[Kulaura]]), just north of the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. He then appointed his stepbrother Dharmadhwaj to govern over the old capital, which retained its name as Gour. Conflict did not emerge as both rulers thought that they were in control of the kingdom as a whole, but gradually the two lands split to become two different kingdoms; Gour and [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] in 1170 AD. The two stepsons worked together and hosted a [[Vedic]] [[yajna]] at the Bhatera Homer Tila at Brahmachal which was arranged by Nidhipati Shastri, who was a descendant of Ananda Shastri - a [[Brahmin]] from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] who arrived in Sylhet during the rule of Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. Another yajna was hosted by Raja Sengkwchak Dharmadhar of the [[Twipra Kingdom]] with Nidhipati as a priest as well who was rewarded with what would become the Ita Kingdom. Dharmadhwaj of Gour died in 1200, and was succeeded by his son, Rajadhwaj who ruled until his death in 1230 in which his son, Gouradhwaj Bhabananda took the throne.\n\n===Civil war===\n[[Raja Govardhan]] rose to power in 1250 following the death of his father, Gouradhwaj. During this period, Upananda was the King of [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]]. The long-lasted conflict between the north and south continued during Govardhan's reign. Govardhan appointed his chief minister, [[Madan Rai]], to somehow find a way to lure Upananda's general, [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]], to use him as a tool to infiltrate Brahmachal, as Govardhan was not fond of Upananda. Govardhan and Rai then made an agreement with Govardhan's general Virabhadra to give his daughter, Chandrakala, in marriage to Singh. The marriage was successful, despite protests, and Singh maintained a good relationship with General Virabhadra and a developing relationship with the Gour royal court. Singh had close ties with the [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]], the border guards for the [[Twipra Kingdom]] south of Brahmachal. He managed to persuade the Kuki chiefs into raiding Raja Upananda's palace in the dead of the night, massacring most of its inmates. With the emergence of a civil war between Brahmachal and Gour, Raja Upananda was subsequently killed. Brahmachal became a part of the Gour kingdom again, and Govardhan appointed [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] as its feudal governor. Babysat by the Upananda's older sister-in-law, Anna Purna, thirteen royal children managed to flee to the jungles where they stumbled across Giridhari, a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] [[sannyasi]], Giridhari took them to [[Kamakhya Temple]] where they were trained into hermitage and would return to Gour a few years later during the tribal invasion.\n\n===Conflict with Tungachal===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Tungachal conflict\n| date       = 1258\n| place      = Banks of Ghungi Jurir Haor, Tungachal\n| territory  = [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal]] secured to Gour administration\n| result     = Shandul replaces Epivishnu as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = Tungachal Kingdom\n----Brahmachal remnant officers\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n* [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2 = '''Raja Epivishnu'''{{KIA}}\n* General Raghu{{POW}}\n* Minister Bhadra Janardan\n| }}\n[[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] which was ruled by Upananda contained the territory of Tungachal. In effect, this meant that the feudal ruler of Tungachal, Epivishnu - who was not given a choice - was effectively under the control of [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Having close ties with Brahmachal and Tripura, Epivishnu was adamant to Govardhan and Singh's amicable compromises. With Epivishnu refusing every pleasant proposal given to be a feudal ruler under Gour, Govardhan and Singh decided it was time that they dethrone Epivishnu and appoint someone else to govern Tungachal. The Gour forces entered Tungachal, and a battle emerged on the banks of the Ghungi Jurir Haor. Raja Epivishnu was murdered and his commander-in-chief General Raghu was kidnapped and taken as a captive back to Gour. Govardhan then appointed his second general, Shandul, to be the feudal ruler of Tungachal.\n\n===Tribal invasion===\nThe Raja of the [[Twipra Kingdom]], Ratan Manikya was informed of Singh's treacherous actions and how he tricked the Kuki chiefs, he decided that he takes actions. He was also told of the murder of Raja Epivishnu, whom he was a friend of. Ratan believed the Gour administration was going too far and decided to also put a stop to Govardhan's craving of invading neighbouring kingdoms. He sent a contingent towards Brahmachal to attack [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Singh's forces were outnumbered, and requested assistance from Govardhan. However, Govardhan was unable to help as Gour was facing an invasion in the north from the [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. Singh was killed by the Tripura forces and the Kuki chiefs saw this as an opportunity for them to annex Brahmachal to the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. [[Jaidev Rai]], son of the minister of Raja Upananda, who was the king of Brahmachal before Amar Singh, was made the feudal ruler under the Tripuris. The [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s then proceeded to Tungachal, in an attempt to dethrone Shandul. Shandul decided to flee to Gour, thus enabling the Tripuris to bloodlessly annex Tungachal to its kingdom as well. The former minister of Tungachal, Bhadra Janardan, was appointed as the feudal ruler of Tungachal under the Twipra Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Jaintia Kingdom]], north of Gour, attempted to invade and annex Gour to its kingdom as they could see that Govardhan was focused on the insurgencies in the southern areas of his kingdom and on securing Brahmachal and Tungachal. The various indigenous tribes and neighbouring kingdoms including the [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s, [[Kuki people|Kuki]]s, [[Kachari people|Kachari]]s and [[Naga people|Naga]]s joined forces with the [[Pnar people|Pnar]] and [[Khasi people|Khasi]] of the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in attacking Northern Sylhet. Being attacked from both north and south directions, and having no support from neighbouring states, Govardhan was dethroned and killed in battle. However, the thirteen royals of Brahmachal who had fled to [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamakhya]] during the civil war, had returned to Gour, guided by Giridhari, after receiving military training, religious and magical education from the [[Kamrup region]] for a number of years.<ref name=heads>{{cite book|title=Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division|chapter=Sylhet District|pages=290|url=https://archive.org/details/principalheadsh00unkngoog/page/n303|year=1868|location=[[Calcutta]]|author=E M Lewis|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sylheterdak.com.bd/details.php?id=5780|title=\u09b8\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7\u099f\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u099a\u09c0\u09a8 \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u09af \u09b8\u09ae\u09c1\u09b9|language=bn|date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=Sylheter Dak}}</ref> Being led by Upananda's nephew, [[Gour Govinda]], they defeated the rebels; warding them all off and recapturing Gour.<ref name=back/> Govardhan's heir, [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]], was still a minor and so the queen-mother Apurna consented to Govinda being the King of Gour.<ref name=pak/>\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:05122009 Hill of Raja Gour Govinda Sylhet photo2 Ranadipam Basu.jpg|thumb|The hill of Raja Gour Govinda in Chowhatta, Sylhet.]]\n[[Gour Govinda]] dramatically restored Gour's reputation as a regional superpower by constructing forts all over his kingdom, guarding his kingdom with large stones (shil; from which the name Shilhot/Sylhet is theorised to have come from) and establishing a number of military training camps.

They gained some authority in the kingdom, being favoured by Govinda over the native Hindus for their religious orthodoxy. The elitist Brahmins cooperatively led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over during the reign of Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s (''untouchables'') of the lowest social status. The Brahmins from [[Central India]] brought by Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva, were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class \"Govinda Brahmins\" as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\nA small number of [[Muslims|Muslim families]] from neighbouring Bengal also settled in Gour, possibly following [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]]'s 1254 [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Invasion]]. One day, [[Ghazi Burhanuddin]] - who lived with his family in Tultikar -  sacrificed a cow for the [[aqiqah]] of his newborn son, Gulzar Alam. [[Gour Govinda]], in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off. Shortly after this incident, Qadi Nuruddin of Taraf celebrated his son's marriage ceremony by slaughtering a cow for them to eat. The Qadi was executed by the feudal ruler Achak Narayan. After both men being punished, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Halimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issue with Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]]. This marked the start of the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303, with the Sultan appointing his nephew, [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], to lead an army against the Raja. A number of battles took place, with Govinda managing to defeat the Muslims of Bengal. However, in the final battle, Govinda fled with his family following the arrival of the warrior-saint [[Shah Jalal]] and his companions, numbering over three hundred. [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]] was appointed the first Wazir of Sylhet, and Tungachal would subsequently be captured off Achak Narayan in the following year by [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and his 12 [[lascar]]s.\nghaturam\n\n==List of rulers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

It was founded by Gurak, off-shooting from the [[Kamarupa Kingdom|Kamarupa Empire]]'s [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in 630 AD. The Kings of Gour are described as patrons of [[Hinduism|Hindu revivalism]] in what was previously a predominantly Buddhist and animist populated land. The 11th century king, Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva is recognised for introducing the ''navadinga'' (nine war boats) and heavily improving the kingdom's infantry, cavalry, and elephant power.<ref name=gupta/> Due to familial tensions, the kingdom split into two separate kingdoms in 1170; '''Gour''' (Northern Sylhet) and '''Brahmachal''' (Southern Sylhet), before being reunited by [[Raja Govardhan]] in the early years of his reign. However, this would be short-lasted as during Govardhan's reign, the kingdom would suffer attacks from neighbouring kingdoms of all directions; eventually leading to the latter's death and the annexation of Brahmachal from Gour to [[Twipra Kingdom|Twipra]]. [[Gour Govinda]] would be the last king to succeed him. In contrast to Govardhan, he would revive Gour back into a regional superpower, warding off all potential enemies, regaining lost territory, introducing defensive strategies like [[archery]] in war for the first time in [[Bengal]]'s history and improving Gour's military status.<ref name=potro/> Noted as a disrespectful and intolerant tyrant, Gour Govinda oppressed religious minorities living in his kingdom, in particular the followers of [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]] and certain [[Hindu denominations]]. The kingdom came to an end after the Islamic [[conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303 led by [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], [[Syed Nasiruddin]] and [[Shah Jalal]], leading to the flight of Govinda and the royal family, and the subsequent incorporation of Sylhet with mainland Muslim [[Bengal]] ruled by Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firuz Shah]].<ref name=\"Session1980\">{{cite book|author=North East India History Association.

Some say that the name originated from the kingdom's founder; Gurak, the son of Raja Guhak just as Jaintia was named after Jayantak and [[Laur Kingdom|Laur]] after Ladduk. Other theories are that it was named following the 1170 partition of the kingdom into two. The north was renamed Gour (also transliterated as Gauda in [[Sanskrit]]) as in imitation of the great Hindu [[Gauda Kingdom]] which ruled [[Bengal]] from 590AD to 626AD.<ref name=back/>\n\n==Location and origin==\nThe kingdom consisted of majority of the modern-day [[Sylhet District]]. It included some eastern parts of the modern-day [[Moulvibazar District]] until it split from Gour to become the independent kingdom of Brahmachal. The final king of Gour, [[Gour Govinda]] would reunite Brahmachal to the Gour Kingdom. The [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal kingdom]], to its southwest, was  a vassal state of Gour, and later Brahmachal would be one as well. With Govinda turning Gour into a regional superpower, the [[Laur Kingdom]] may have also been a vassal state as Takerghat (in Laur) was made the naval headquarters during Govinda's rule. In the 850s, much of the kingdom's territory was described to be \"outside the pale of human habitation\" with central and southwestern Sylhet forming a large sea.<ref>{{cite book|title=Brahmanic Settlements in Different Subdivisions of Ancient Bengal|publisher=Indian Studies: Past & Present|year=1967|last=Niyogi|first=Puspa|page=41}}</ref> This explains the naval significance which the Kings of Gour boasted.<ref>{{cite journal|first=K.

The small tribe remains in existence today and are also known by their endonym, the Laleng, and claim descent from these kings. Their traditions are a mixture of tribal animistic and Hindu beliefs. They have a distinct language to [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]] and many migrated to [[Assam]] and [[Meghalaya]] following the 1947 [[Partition of India]] and 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Patra, The|author=Khan, Sadat Ullah}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\n[[File:Xuanzang w.jpg|thumb|[[Xuanzang]] was a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled to Sheelachatal (Sylhet) in the seventh century.]]\nBefore the establishment of the Gour Kingdom, the area was a part of [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintia]] in the greater [[Kamarupa Kingdom]]. When Guhak ascended the Jaintia throne, he married a princess from Kamarupa. Guhak had a deep interest in [[Hinduism]] and migration of [[Brahmins]] from the [[Kamrup region]] to this area took place. On his way back, Guhak brought a stone image known as ''Kangsa-Nisudhana'', an image of [[Krishna]] and [[Balaram]] murdering [[Kamsa]], as well as Grivakali and Janghakali, and they put it on top of a hill in modern-day where they would worship it. During the British colonial period, this hill was also home to the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow.<ref name=back/>\n\nGuhak had three sons; Jayantak, Gurak and Ladduk, and two daughters; Sheela and Chatala. It is said that his eldest daughter, Sheela, was once bathing in a lake south of the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule) and she was kidnapped. After being rescued by Guhak, Sheela started to become more religious and live a secluded life. Chatala indulged herself in an unlawful relationship with one of the palace servants, leading to her being disowned and dumped in a distant island in the middle of 2000 square mile lake to the south of the kingdom. After Sheela's death at a young age, Guhak gave up his kingdom to also lead a more ascetic life. This port-area around the lake, which was the largest centre in the Jaintia Kingdom for trade, was named Sheela [[haat]] (or Sheela's marketplace) in her honour. Sources such as the Hattanath Tales mention Sheelachatal was named after both daughters for the region.<ref name=fazlur/> This is one of many theories of how [[Sylhet]] got its name.<ref>see [[Names of Sylhet]]</ref> [[Xuanzang]] of [[China]] mentions that he visited Sheelachatal in the 630s in his book, the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]''. He split the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] into three for his three sons. He gave his eldest son, Jayantak, what would become the hilly [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. He gave his second son, Gurak, the southern plains which would be named Gour, and he gave his third son, Luddak, the western plains which would become the [[Laur Kingdom]].<ref name=pak/>\n\nGurak made the capital initially at Borchola, 5 miles northwest of modern-day [[Sylhet]], but moved it to Malini stream bank, 7 miles south of Sylhet. He appointed Marbel as his chief minister. The minister was stationed in a hillock (now known as [[Mona Rai]]'s Tila) near [[Sylhet|the port]] for ease in tax collection and civil duties.<ref name=back>{{cite book|first=Rajmohan|last=Nath|title=The back-ground of Assamese culture|pages=113|url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.34829/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1948|publisher=A. K. Nath|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Mass migration period===\nBeing separated from [[Kamarupa]] by the [[Jaintia Kingdom]], Gour started interacting more with the Hindu lands to its west such as Tripura and Prayagraj. Minister Marbel was ordered to find a wife for Gurak's son, Srihasta. He went south to the [[Twipra Kingdom]] in eastern Bengal where he found a young princess for Srihasta. When Srihasta ascended the throne in 660, he too contributed to the increase of [[Hindu]] influence to the predominantly [[Tantric Buddhist]] and animist-populated land. He installed a stone [[Shivalingam]], which he called Bateshwar Shiva, in modern-day Bondor Bazar which he obtained during a pilgrimage to [[Akshayavat]] in [[Prayagraj]]. It is said he did this to compete with the Buddhist Lokenath statue which a group of merchants installed in modern-day Kazir Bazar. Gour also bordered Bengal to the west which was ruled by the Buddhist [[Pala Empire]]. The Buddhist and later Muslim rule in Bengal led to large numbers of [[Hindus]] to migrate to Gour, which was considered a Hindu stronghold. Srihasta's reign ended in 690 AD and he was succeeded by Kritti Pal. The names of the four kings who succeeded Kritti Pal is unknown until 870 AD, when Bhut Vishnudeva ascends the throne as the 7th king of Gour. He was known to have been [[Muteness|mute]]. He was succeeded by Navagirvan Deva (also known as Ananta Deva Navagirvanta), Gokul Kishore Deva, and then Nara Narayan Deva.\n\nThe 11th King of Gour was Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. He became king in 990 AD after the death of Narayan Deva. He is considered to be one of the greatest kings of Gour. In 1027, he constructed a towering stone [[Krishna]] temple on the Kangsa-Nisudhana hill (which became the hillock of the Civil Surgeon's Bungalow during British rule).<ref name=eaton/> A famed patron of [[Hinduism]], he hosted hundreds of [[Brahmins]] and [[Vedic scholar]]s from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] and other parts of [[the subcontinent]], employing them upon the services of temples in his kingdom.<ref name=pak/><ref name=fazlur>{{cite book|title=Sile\u1e6der m\u0101\u1e6di, Sile\u1e6der m\u0101nush|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|page=33|year=1991|publisher=MA Sattar}}</ref> They were given thousands of acres of land each in over hundreds of villages across the kingdom.

After the death of [[Srichandra]] of eastern Bengal's [[Chandra dynasty]], Kesava took advantage and conquered the southern parts of the [[Sylhet region]]; extending the Gour kingdom south of the [[Kushiyara River]].<ref name=pak>{{cite book|title=East Pakistan District Gazetteers: Sylhet|year=1970|publisher=East Pakistan Government Press}}</ref>\n\nKesava's reign ended in 1040, leaving behind three sons; Jadava Kesava, Kangsa Narayan and Ishan Deva. The elder son, Jadava was meant to be king though he was said to have been childless and diseased, and so his brother, Kangsa Narayan became the next king instead. Kangsa established a [[satra (Ekasarana Dharma)|satra]] in the memory of his father, and dug Kamala Lake in memory of his mother, Kamala. Kangsa's rule was very short as he was killed by a wild elephant at a young age. His newly-wed and pregnant wife, Kalavati, a princess from [[Bihar]], became the queen regent with Prince Ishan Deva, General Viradatta and Minister Vanamali Kar managing the kingdom. Kalavati gave birth to a son who was named Pravir Deva. To celebrate Pravir's birth, Ishan installed the [[Madhu-Kaitabha]]ri Temple - which contained an image of [[Vishnu]] - on a hillock now known as Manik Pir's hill.<ref name=fazlur/> The installation ceremony was conducted by a group of [[Brahmins]] and they were rewarded by the administration by receiving excessive land grants in the kingdom. Pravir Deva became the Raja of Gour when he reached a mature age in 1080 AD. He had a son named Bhujavir.\n\n===Partition===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Brahmachal infiltration\n| date       = 1253\n| place      = Brahmachal palace (Baramchal, [[Kulaura]])\n| territory  = [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] re-annexed to Gour\n| result     = Amar Singh replaces Upananda as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = [[Brahmachal Kingdom]]\n----\n{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Twipra Kingdom]] (''defector'')\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n| commander2 = '''Raja Upananda'''{{KIA}}\n* Commander [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] (''defector'')\n* Minister (name unknown)\n* [[Jaidev Rai]] (minister's son)\n----{{flagicon image|Coat of Arms of Tripura Princely State.gif|border=no}} [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]] (''defector'')\n| }}\nIn 1140 AD, after the death of Bhujavir Deva, his son Kshetra Pal ascended the throne. Raja Kshetra Pal also practised [[polygyny]] and had two wives; Ratnavati and Surama. During his reign, an earthquake took place which changed the country's contour and topography. It is said that a new river emerged in the town, which the King named after his second and favourite wife, Rani Surama, as the [[Surma River]]. The King's first son came from Surama and his name was Brahmajit. A few years later, Kshetra's first wife Ratnavati also gave birth to a son, called Dharmadhwaj. However, conspiracies emerged in the country as a number of people were suspicious of Ratnavati accusing her of jealousy and child illegitimacy as Kshetra was an old man by this time. After Kshetra died, his eldest son, Brahmajit stepped to the throne. His stepmother Ratnavati and her associates gave Brahmajit a hard time as she believed that as she was the elder wife, her son should have been the King.\n\nScared for his life, Brahmajit moved his capital to a place known as Brahmachal (now Baramchal, [[Kulaura]]), just north of the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. He then appointed his stepbrother Dharmadhwaj to govern over the old capital, which retained its name as Gour. Conflict did not emerge as both rulers thought that they were in control of the kingdom as a whole, but gradually the two lands split to become two different kingdoms; Gour and [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] in 1170 AD. The two stepsons worked together and hosted a [[Vedic]] [[yajna]] at the Bhatera Homer Tila at Brahmachal which was arranged by Nidhipati Shastri, who was a descendant of Ananda Shastri - a [[Brahmin]] from [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] who arrived in Sylhet during the rule of Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva. Another yajna was hosted by Raja Sengkwchak Dharmadhar of the [[Twipra Kingdom]] with Nidhipati as a priest as well who was rewarded with what would become the Ita Kingdom. Dharmadhwaj of Gour died in 1200, and was succeeded by his son, Rajadhwaj who ruled until his death in 1230 in which his son, Gouradhwaj Bhabananda took the throne.\n\n===Civil war===\n[[Raja Govardhan]] rose to power in 1250 following the death of his father, Gouradhwaj. During this period, Upananda was the King of [[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]]. The long-lasted conflict between the north and south continued during Govardhan's reign. Govardhan appointed his chief minister, [[Madan Rai]], to somehow find a way to lure Upananda's general, [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]], to use him as a tool to infiltrate Brahmachal, as Govardhan was not fond of Upananda. Govardhan and Rai then made an agreement with Govardhan's general Virabhadra to give his daughter, Chandrakala, in marriage to Singh. The marriage was successful, despite protests, and Singh maintained a good relationship with General Virabhadra and a developing relationship with the Gour royal court. Singh had close ties with the [[Kuki people|Kuki chiefs]], the border guards for the [[Twipra Kingdom]] south of Brahmachal. He managed to persuade the Kuki chiefs into raiding Raja Upananda's palace in the dead of the night, massacring most of its inmates. With the emergence of a civil war between Brahmachal and Gour, Raja Upananda was subsequently killed. Brahmachal became a part of the Gour kingdom again, and Govardhan appointed [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]] as its feudal governor. Babysat by the Upananda's older sister-in-law, Anna Purna, thirteen royal children managed to flee to the jungles where they stumbled across Giridhari, a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] [[sannyasi]], Giridhari took them to [[Kamakhya Temple]] where they were trained into hermitage and would return to Gour a few years later during the tribal invasion.\n\n===Conflict with Tungachal===\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict   = Tungachal conflict\n| date       = 1258\n| place      = Banks of Ghungi Jurir Haor, Tungachal\n| territory  = [[Taraf Kingdom|Tungachal]] secured to Gour administration\n| result     = Shandul replaces Epivishnu as the ruler of Brahmachal\n| combatant1 = Gour Kingdom\n| combatant2 = Tungachal Kingdom\n----Brahmachal remnant officers\n| commander1 = '''[[Raja Govardhan]]'''\n* Minister [[Madan Rai]]\n* Commander-in-chief Virabhadra\n* Commander Shandul\n* [[Garuda of Gour|Prince Garuda]]\n* [[Amar Singh (general)|Raja Amar Singh]]{{KIA}}\n| commander2 = '''Raja Epivishnu'''{{KIA}}\n* General Raghu{{POW}}\n* Minister Bhadra Janardan\n| }}\n[[Brahmachal Kingdom|Brahmachal]] which was ruled by Upananda contained the territory of Tungachal. In effect, this meant that the feudal ruler of Tungachal, Epivishnu - who was not given a choice - was effectively under the control of [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Having close ties with Brahmachal and Tripura, Epivishnu was adamant to Govardhan and Singh's amicable compromises. With Epivishnu refusing every pleasant proposal given to be a feudal ruler under Gour, Govardhan and Singh decided it was time that they dethrone Epivishnu and appoint someone else to govern Tungachal. The Gour forces entered Tungachal, and a battle emerged on the banks of the Ghungi Jurir Haor. Raja Epivishnu was murdered and his commander-in-chief General Raghu was kidnapped and taken as a captive back to Gour. Govardhan then appointed his second general, Shandul, to be the feudal ruler of Tungachal.\n\n===Tribal invasion===\nThe Raja of the [[Twipra Kingdom]], Ratan Manikya was informed of Singh's treacherous actions and how he tricked the Kuki chiefs, he decided that he takes actions. He was also told of the murder of Raja Epivishnu, whom he was a friend of. Ratan believed the Gour administration was going too far and decided to also put a stop to Govardhan's craving of invading neighbouring kingdoms. He sent a contingent towards Brahmachal to attack [[Amar Singh (general)|Amar Singh]]. Singh's forces were outnumbered, and requested assistance from Govardhan. However, Govardhan was unable to help as Gour was facing an invasion in the north from the [[Jaintia Kingdom]]. Singh was killed by the Tripura forces and the Kuki chiefs saw this as an opportunity for them to annex Brahmachal to the [[Twipra Kingdom]]. [[Jaidev Rai]], son of the minister of Raja Upananda, who was the king of Brahmachal before Amar Singh, was made the feudal ruler under the Tripuris. The [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s then proceeded to Tungachal, in an attempt to dethrone Shandul. Shandul decided to flee to Gour, thus enabling the Tripuris to bloodlessly annex Tungachal to its kingdom as well. The former minister of Tungachal, Bhadra Janardan, was appointed as the feudal ruler of Tungachal under the Twipra Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Jaintia Kingdom]], north of Gour, attempted to invade and annex Gour to its kingdom as they could see that Govardhan was focused on the insurgencies in the southern areas of his kingdom and on securing Brahmachal and Tungachal. The various indigenous tribes and neighbouring kingdoms including the [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]]s, [[Kuki people|Kuki]]s, [[Kachari people|Kachari]]s and [[Naga people|Naga]]s joined forces with the [[Pnar people|Pnar]] and [[Khasi people|Khasi]] of the [[Jaintia Kingdom]] in attacking Northern Sylhet. Being attacked from both north and south directions, and having no support from neighbouring states, Govardhan was dethroned and killed in battle. However, the thirteen royals of Brahmachal who had fled to [[Kamakhya Temple|Kamakhya]] during the civil war, had returned to Gour, guided by Giridhari, after receiving military training, religious and magical education from the [[Kamrup region]] for a number of years.<ref name=heads>{{cite book|title=Principal Heads of the History and Statistics of the Dacca Division|chapter=Sylhet District|pages=290|url=https://archive.org/details/principalheadsh00unkngoog/page/n303|year=1868|location=[[Calcutta]]|author=E M Lewis|publisher=Calcutta Central Press Company}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sylheterdak.com.bd/details.php?id=5780|title=\u09b8\u09bf\u09b2\u09c7\u099f\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u099a\u09c0\u09a8 \u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09cd\u09af \u09b8\u09ae\u09c1\u09b9|language=bn|date=1 Feb 2017|publisher=Sylheter Dak}}</ref> Being led by Upananda's nephew, [[Gour Govinda]], they defeated the rebels; warding them all off and recapturing Gour.<ref name=back/> Govardhan's heir, [[Garuda of Gour|Garuda]], was still a minor and so the queen-mother Apurna consented to Govinda being the King of Gour.<ref name=pak/>\n\n===Restoration===\n[[File:05122009 Hill of Raja Gour Govinda Sylhet photo2 Ranadipam Basu.jpg|thumb|The hill of Raja Gour Govinda in Chowhatta, Sylhet.]]\n[[Gour Govinda]] dramatically restored Gour's reputation as a regional superpower by constructing forts all over his kingdom, guarding his kingdom with large stones (shil; from which the name Shilhot/Sylhet is theorised to have come from) and establishing a number of military training camps.

They gained some authority in the kingdom, being favoured by Govinda over the native Hindus for their religious orthodoxy. The elitist Brahmins cooperatively led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over during the reign of Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s (''untouchables'') of the lowest social status. The Brahmins from [[Central India]] brought by Govinda-Rana Kesava Deva, were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class \"Govinda Brahmins\" as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\nA small number of [[Muslims|Muslim families]] from neighbouring Bengal also settled in Gour, possibly following [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]]'s 1254 [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Invasion]]. One day, [[Ghazi Burhanuddin]] - who lived with his family in Tultikar -  sacrificed a cow for the [[aqiqah]] of his newborn son, Gulzar Alam. [[Gour Govinda]], in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off. Shortly after this incident, Qadi Nuruddin of Taraf celebrated his son's marriage ceremony by slaughtering a cow for them to eat. The Qadi was executed by the feudal ruler Achak Narayan. After both men being punished, Burhanuddin and Nuruddin's brother, Halimuddin, travelled to lower Bengal where they addressed their issue with Sultan [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]]. This marked the start of the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] in 1303, with the Sultan appointing his nephew, [[Sikandar Khan Ghazi]], to lead an army against the Raja. A number of battles took place, with Govinda managing to defeat the Muslims of Bengal.

While in San Francisco's [[University Club of San Francisco|University Club]] as a guest on May 18, 1903, he agreed to a $50 wager (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) to prove that a four-wheeled machine could be driven across the country. He accepted even though at age 31 he did not own a car, had practically no experience driving, and had no maps to follow. Jackson and his wife planned to return to their Burlington, Vermont, home in a few days, and both had been taking automobile driving lessons while in San Francisco. She returned home by train, allowing him to take his adventure by automobile.\n\n[[File:1903 Winton touring car 01 2012 DC 00466.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibit at the [[National Museum of American History]] recreating H.

A route through the [[Sacramento Valley]] and along the [[Oregon Trail]] also allowed them to avoid the higher passes in the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\n===Journey===\n[[File:HoratioJacksonNelson.jpeg|thumb|right|Jackson driving the ''Vermont'' on the 1903 cross-country drive]]\nOn May 23, 1903 the car was transported by [[ferry]] from San Francisco to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and pointed eastward. But only {{convert|15|mi|km}} into the journey, the car blew a tire.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://americacomesalive.com/2012/08/21/first-dog-to-cross-u-s-by-auto/ |title = First Dog Crosses U.S. by Auto |date = August 21, 2012 |work = America Comes Alive! |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> Jackson and Crocker replaced it with the only spare they had, in fact, the only right-sized spare tire they could find in all of San Francisco.\n\nOn the first night of the journey they discovered that the side lanterns were too dim. On the second night, they stopped early in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and replaced them with a large spotlight mounted on the front of the ''Vermont''.<ref name=Duncan/> The duo was also assisted in Sacramento by bicyclists who offered them road maps. Jackson was unable to buy a new tire, but purchased some used inner tubes.\n\nGoing northwards out of Sacramento, the noise of the car covered the fact that the duo's cooking gear was falling off. They were also given a {{convert|108|mi|km|adj=on}} misdirection by a woman so that she could send them to the spot where her family could see an automobile.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe rough trek towards [[Oregon]] required them to haul the car across deep streams with the block and tackle. Somewhere along this route, Jackson lost a pair of his glasses. Items continued to be lost, including another pair of Jackson's glasses.<ref name=Duncan/> They were also forced to pay a $4 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1905}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) toll by a land-owner in order to cross his property on a \"bad, rocky, mountain road\" as Jackson described it.<ref name=Duncan/> When their tires blew out they were required to wind rope around the wheels. Jackson did manage to find a [[telegraph]] office and wired back to San Francisco for replacement tires to be transported to them along the journey.\n\nReaching [[Alturas, California]], Jackson and Crocker stopped to wait for the tires. They offered locals rides in the car in exchange for a \"wild west show\". When the tires failed to materialize, however, they continued on after a three-day wait.\n\nOn June 6, the car broke down, and they had to be towed to a nearby ranch by a cowboy on horseback. Crocker made repairs, but a fuel leak caused them to lose all of their available gasoline, and Jackson rented a bicycle for Crocker to travel {{convert|25|mi|km}} to [[Burns, Oregon]], for fuel. After suffering a flat tire on the bicycle, he returned with {{convert|4|USgal|l}} of fuel (which Jackson complained cost him \"nearly twenty dollars\"), and they returned to Burns to fill up.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nOn June 9, outside of [[Vale, Oregon]], the ''Vermont'' ran out of oil. Jackson walked back to the last town to get oil, only to discover eventually that they had been stopped only a short distance outside of Vale. The next day they arrived in [[Ontario, Oregon]], where supplies waited for them.\n\n[[File:Photo bud portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|Bud]]\nSomewhere near [[Caldwell, Idaho]], Jackson and Crocker obtained a dog, a [[Pit Bull]] named Bud.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_7_2.html |work = America on the Move |title = First to Drive Across the Continent |publisher = [[National Museum of American History]] |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> As it turns out, Jackson had wanted a dog companion since Sacramento.<ref name=Duncan/> Newspapers at the time gave a variety of stories of how Bud was acquired, including that he was stolen; in a letter to his wife, Nelson said a man sold him the dog for $15<ref>{{cite web |first = Sarah |last = Laskow |date = January 22, 2016 |url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-first-crosscountry-road-trip-took-2-men-and-a-pitbull-63-days |title = The First Cross-Country Road Trip Took 2 Men and a Pitbull 63 Days |work = Atlas Obscura |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|15|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). It turned out that the dusty [[Alkali Flat|alkali flats]] the travelers encountered would bother Bud's eyes so much (the ''Vermont'' had neither a roof nor windshield) that Jackson eventually fitted him with a pair of goggles. At one point, Bud drank bad water and became ill, but survived.\n\nAt this point, the trio became celebrities. The press came out at every stop to take their picture and conduct interviews. At [[Mountain Home, Idaho]], citizens warned them that the Oregon Trail was not good further east, so Jackson and Crocker veered off their original course along the southern edge of the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]]. At [[Hailey, Idaho]], Crocker wired the Winton Company for more parts.\n\nOn June 16, somewhere in [[Idaho]], Jackson's coat, containing most of the travelers' money, fell off and was not found. At their next stop, Jackson had to wire his wife to send them money to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Between June 20 and 21, all three of them got lost in Wyoming, and went without food for 36 hours before finding a sheepherder who gave them a meal of roast lamb and boiled corn.<ref name=Duncan/> Before reaching Cheyenne, however, the car's wheel bearings gave out, and Crocker had to talk a farmer into letting them have the wheel bearings of his mowing machine.\n\nThe travelers eventually reached [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on July 12. From there on, they were able to use a few paved roads, and their trip was much easier. The only mishap happened just east of [[Buffalo, New York]], when the ''Vermont'' ran into a hidden obstacle in the road and Jackson, Croker, and Bud were thrown from the car.<ref name=Duncan/> They arrived in [[New York City]] on July 26, 1903, 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes after commencing their journey in San Francisco, in the first automobile to successfully transit the North American continent.<ref>{{cite book |last = Rafferty |first = Tod |title = The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of American Motorcycles |location = Philadelphia |publisher = Courage Books |year = 1999 |page = 22 |isbn = 9780762405282 |quote = The first transcontinental crossing by any type of motor vehicle was by [[George A.

About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from home his car once again broke down. His two brothers, each driving his own automobile, came to help him get going again. Shortly after returning to the road, both of the brothers' vehicles broke down, and Jackson towed them both home with the ''Vermont''. Upon reaching the threshold of Jackson's garage, the ''Vermont'''s drive chain snapped.

In 1903, he and driving partner [[Sewall K. Crocker]] became the first people to drive an automobile across the United States.\n\n==Early life and medical career==\nJackson was born in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada, on March 25, 1872, a son of Samuel Nelson Jackson (1838\u20131913) and Mary Anne (Parkyn) Jackson (1843\u20131916).<ref name=\"Branch\">{{cite book |last = Jackson |first = Samuel Nelson |date = 1911 |title = A Branch of the Jacksons and Correlated Families, 1730\u20131911 |url = https://archive.org/details/branchofjacksons01jack/page/56/mode/2up/search/nelson |location = New York |publisher = Bartlett-Orr Press |pages = 56-57 |id = {{OCLC|21417417|285183498}} |access-date = April 4, 2020 |via = [[Internet Archive]] }}</ref> His siblings included [[John Holmes Jackson]], who served several terms as [[List of mayors of Burlington, Vermont|mayor of Burlington, Vermont]].<ref name=\"Branch\"/> Another brother, [[Hollister Jackson]], served as [[Lieutenant governor of Vermont]].

While in San Francisco's [[University Club of San Francisco|University Club]] as a guest on May 18, 1903, he agreed to a $50 wager (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) to prove that a four-wheeled machine could be driven across the country. He accepted even though at age 31 he did not own a car, had practically no experience driving, and had no maps to follow. Jackson and his wife planned to return to their Burlington, Vermont, home in a few days, and both had been taking automobile driving lessons while in San Francisco. She returned home by train, allowing him to take his adventure by automobile.\n\n[[File:1903 Winton touring car 01 2012 DC 00466.jpg|thumb|left|Exhibit at the [[National Museum of American History]] recreating H.

He bought a slightly used, two-cylinder,<ref>{{cite book |last = Stein |first = Ralph |year = 1971 |title = The American Automobile |url = https://archive.org/details/americanautomobi00stei |url-access = registration |location = New York |publisher = Random House |page =  |isbn = }}{{page needed|date=August 2015}}</ref> 20&nbsp;hp<ref>{{cite book |last = Kimes |first = Beverly |year = 1996 |title = Standard Catalog of American Cars, 1805\u20131942 |location = Iola, WI |publisher = Krause Publications |isbn = 0-87341-428-4 }}{{page needed|date= August 2015}}</ref> Winton, which he named the [[Vermont (automobile)|''Vermont'']], after his home state, bade his wife goodbye, and left San Francisco on May 23, carrying coats, rubber protective suits, sleeping bags, blankets, canteens, a water bag, an axe, a shovel, a telescope, tools, spare parts, a block and tackle, cans for extra gasoline and oil, a Kodak camera, a rifle, a shotgun, and pistols.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite book |last1 = Duncan |first1 = Dayton |last2 = Burns |first2 = Ken |last-author-amp = yes |year = 2003 |title = Horatio's Drive: America's First Road Trip |location = New York |publisher = Alfred A.

A route through the [[Sacramento Valley]] and along the [[Oregon Trail]] also allowed them to avoid the higher passes in the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\n===Journey===\n[[File:HoratioJacksonNelson.jpeg|thumb|right|Jackson driving the ''Vermont'' on the 1903 cross-country drive]]\nOn May 23, 1903 the car was transported by [[ferry]] from San Francisco to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and pointed eastward. But only {{convert|15|mi|km}} into the journey, the car blew a tire.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://americacomesalive.com/2012/08/21/first-dog-to-cross-u-s-by-auto/ |title = First Dog Crosses U.S. by Auto |date = August 21, 2012 |work = America Comes Alive! |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> Jackson and Crocker replaced it with the only spare they had, in fact, the only right-sized spare tire they could find in all of San Francisco.\n\nOn the first night of the journey they discovered that the side lanterns were too dim. On the second night, they stopped early in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and replaced them with a large spotlight mounted on the front of the ''Vermont''.<ref name=Duncan/> The duo was also assisted in Sacramento by bicyclists who offered them road maps. Jackson was unable to buy a new tire, but purchased some used inner tubes.\n\nGoing northwards out of Sacramento, the noise of the car covered the fact that the duo's cooking gear was falling off. They were also given a {{convert|108|mi|km|adj=on}} misdirection by a woman so that she could send them to the spot where her family could see an automobile.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nThe rough trek towards [[Oregon]] required them to haul the car across deep streams with the block and tackle. Somewhere along this route, Jackson lost a pair of his glasses. Items continued to be lost, including another pair of Jackson's glasses.<ref name=Duncan/> They were also forced to pay a $4 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|4|1905}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}) toll by a land-owner in order to cross his property on a \"bad, rocky, mountain road\" as Jackson described it.<ref name=Duncan/> When their tires blew out they were required to wind rope around the wheels. Jackson did manage to find a [[telegraph]] office and wired back to San Francisco for replacement tires to be transported to them along the journey.\n\nReaching [[Alturas, California]], Jackson and Crocker stopped to wait for the tires. They offered locals rides in the car in exchange for a \"wild west show\". When the tires failed to materialize, however, they continued on after a three-day wait.\n\nOn June 6, the car broke down, and they had to be towed to a nearby ranch by a cowboy on horseback. Crocker made repairs, but a fuel leak caused them to lose all of their available gasoline, and Jackson rented a bicycle for Crocker to travel {{convert|25|mi|km}} to [[Burns, Oregon]], for fuel. After suffering a flat tire on the bicycle, he returned with {{convert|4|USgal|l}} of fuel (which Jackson complained cost him \"nearly twenty dollars\"), and they returned to Burns to fill up.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nOn June 9, outside of [[Vale, Oregon]], the ''Vermont'' ran out of oil. Jackson walked back to the last town to get oil, only to discover eventually that they had been stopped only a short distance outside of Vale. The next day they arrived in [[Ontario, Oregon]], where supplies waited for them.\n\n[[File:Photo bud portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|Bud]]\nSomewhere near [[Caldwell, Idaho]], Jackson and Crocker obtained a dog, a [[Pit Bull]] named Bud.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://amhistory.si.edu/onthemove/exhibition/exhibition_7_2.html |work = America on the Move |title = First to Drive Across the Continent |publisher = [[National Museum of American History]] |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> As it turns out, Jackson had wanted a dog companion since Sacramento.<ref name=Duncan/> Newspapers at the time gave a variety of stories of how Bud was acquired, including that he was stolen; in a letter to his wife, Nelson said a man sold him the dog for $15<ref>{{cite web |first = Sarah |last = Laskow |date = January 22, 2016 |url = https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-first-crosscountry-road-trip-took-2-men-and-a-pitbull-63-days |title = The First Cross-Country Road Trip Took 2 Men and a Pitbull 63 Days |work = Atlas Obscura |access-date = December 9, 2017 }}</ref> (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|15|1903}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}{{inflation-fn|US}}). It turned out that the dusty [[Alkali Flat|alkali flats]] the travelers encountered would bother Bud's eyes so much (the ''Vermont'' had neither a roof nor windshield) that Jackson eventually fitted him with a pair of goggles. At one point, Bud drank bad water and became ill, but survived.\n\nAt this point, the trio became celebrities. The press came out at every stop to take their picture and conduct interviews. At [[Mountain Home, Idaho]], citizens warned them that the Oregon Trail was not good further east, so Jackson and Crocker veered off their original course along the southern edge of the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]]. At [[Hailey, Idaho]], Crocker wired the Winton Company for more parts.\n\nOn June 16, somewhere in [[Idaho]], Jackson's coat, containing most of the travelers' money, fell off and was not found. At their next stop, Jackson had to wire his wife to send them money to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Between June 20 and 21, all three of them got lost in Wyoming, and went without food for 36 hours before finding a sheepherder who gave them a meal of roast lamb and boiled corn.<ref name=Duncan/> Before reaching Cheyenne, however, the car's wheel bearings gave out, and Crocker had to talk a farmer into letting them have the wheel bearings of his mowing machine.\n\nThe travelers eventually reached [[Omaha, Nebraska]], on July 12. From there on, they were able to use a few paved roads, and their trip was much easier. The only mishap happened just east of [[Buffalo, New York]], when the ''Vermont'' ran into a hidden obstacle in the road and Jackson, Croker, and Bud were thrown from the car.<ref name=Duncan/> They arrived in [[New York City]] on July 26, 1903, 63 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes after commencing their journey in San Francisco, in the first automobile to successfully transit the North American continent.<ref>{{cite book |last = Rafferty |first = Tod |title = The Complete Illustrated Encyclopedia of American Motorcycles |location = Philadelphia |publisher = Courage Books |year = 1999 |page = 22 |isbn = 9780762405282 |quote = The first transcontinental crossing by any type of motor vehicle was by [[George A.

About {{convert|15|mi|km}} from home his car once again broke down. His two brothers, each driving his own automobile, came to help him get going again. Shortly after returning to the road, both of the brothers' vehicles broke down, and Jackson towed them both home with the ''Vermont''. Upon reaching the threshold of Jackson's garage, the ''Vermont'''s drive chain snapped.

It was released on April 4, 1995, through the [[Record label|label]] Phantom Hill. After playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', she was offered a solo record deal in the mid-1970s but rejected the offer to attend school. McCormick had previously recorded four albums as part of ''The Brady Bunch'' and a duet album with her co-star [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In 1994, she signed with her brother's record label, Phantom Hill, and recorded ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]]. Barry Coffing was the [[executive producer]] and arranged and produced all the songs. McCormick wanted to fuse genres into the album's overall [[Country music|country]] sound.\n\nThe album received mainly negative reviews; some reviewers were critical of McCormick's choice to record country music. She promoted it through live performances and [[Compact disc|CD]] signings. Its title track and \"Tell Mama\" were released as singles. ''When You Get a Little Lonely'' was re-released in 2008 as a [[Circuit City]] exclusive. Since the album's release, McCormick has continued to perform country music and has participated in the [[reality television]] show [[Gone Country (TV series)|''Gone Country'']]. In a 2008 interview, McCormick said she was disappointed by restrictions to the recording process and wished she had written at least one song for it. ''When You Get A Little Lonely'' is her only album as a solo artist.\n\n== Background and recording ==\n[[File:Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.png|thumb|left|McCormick in a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional photo|alt=A 1971 photograph of Maureen McCormick as part of a 1971 ''The Brady Bunch'' promotional campaign.]]\n\n[[Maureen McCormick]] first rose to prominence while playing [[Marcia Brady]] in the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''.
