It operates the '''Essex Steam Train''' and the '''Essex Clipper Dinner Train'''.\n\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===Essex Steam Train and Riverboat===\nThe Valley Railroad operates the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat. This excursion starts with a 11.36-mile ride aboard the historic Essex Steam Train from Essex Station with scenic views of the [[Connecticut River]] up to Chester. The train reverses direction back to the Deep River Station/Landing. Passengers who have purchased the riverboat tickets can board the ''Becky Thatcher'' at this station. The riverboat brings people on a 75-minute trip up the Connecticut River to the [[East Haddam Bridge|East Haddam Swing Bridge]] and then back to Deep River Landing. The train then retrieves passengers to bring them back to Essex Depot. Trip length is 150 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/the-train-boat/ |title=The Essex Steam Train and Riverboat |publisher=The Valley Railroad Company |location=[[Essex, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Essex Clipper Dinner Train===\nThe Essex Clipper Dinner Train is a 2.5-hour train ride that departs Essex Depot and offers scenic views of the [[Connecticut River]] along the way. The train brings passengers to the northern end of the operable line in Haddam. A seasonal four-course meal is prepared on-board and served in restored 1920s Pullman dining cars.\n\n===Day Out With Thomas===\nEach spring, [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas The Tank Engine]] and [[Percy the Small Engine|Percy The Small Green Engine]] bring [[Day out with Thomas|Day Out With Thomas]] to the Valley Railroad. The Essex Steam Train has participated in this event since the late 1990s and up until recently utilized the [[Strasburg Rail Road|Strasburg Railroad's]] fully steam-powered Thomas replica. However, as the locomotive was only available during the colder, late fall months, and as not to conflict with sales of their North Pole event, the Valley Railroad currently hosts their Day Out with Thomas in the Spring, using a non-powered Thomas which is pushed by one of their own steam locomotives.\n\n===North Pole Express===\nEach November and December, the North Pole Express brings passengers on an imaginary ride to the [[North Pole]] for children and their families. Amenities include on-board entertainment, singing, trackside displays, cookies, hot chocolate, and a gift from Santa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/special-events/north-pole-express/|title=The North Pole Express at the Essex Steam Train|publisher=The Valley Railroad Company|location=[[Essex, Connecticut]]}}</ref>\n\n===Santa Special===\nThe Santa Special is a daytime trip aboard festively-decorated rail cars. It is a shorter ride (60 minutes) without car hosts or refreshments. In 2018, the Santa Special hosted the Elf Academy where passengers learn the skills necessary to become an elf (laughing, singing and dancing) and meet Santa and Mrs. Claus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/special-events/santa-special/|title=The Santa Special at the Essex Steam Train|publisher=The Valley Railroad Company|location=[[Essex, Connecticut]]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bridge remains along Fenwick Branch causeway, December 2016.JPG|thumb|left|Remains of a wooden bridge along the former Fenwick Branch south of Old Saybrook, which was abandoned in the early 20th century]]\n\n===Construction===\nThe vision of a Valley Railroad started in the 1840s when President of the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company, [[James Clark Walkley]] traced the 44-mile route by stagecoach with friend Horace Johnson.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-04-21/news/9904180025_1_saybrook-point-passenger-coach-train |title=Essex Steam Train Is Remnant Of Connecticut Valley Railroad |publisher=The Hartford Courant |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 2, 2014 }}</ref> Walkley and a group of business men obtained a state charter on July 17, 1868, to form the Connecticut Valley Railroad Company and start the process of building a railroad.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\" />\n\nDuring 1868\u20131869, survey crews worked to map out the line from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to [[Old Saybrook Center, Connecticut|Saybrook Point]].\n\nIn April 1870, construction of the line began, with ground breaking taking place in [[Higganum, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"DEEPHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=433674&deepNav_GID=1650 |title=Connecticut Valley Railroad State Park |publisher=Connecticut DEEP |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 2, 2014 }}</ref> The plan called for three phases, the \"Northern Division\" starting in Hartford and continuing to [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]],  the \"Middle Division\" which continued to what is known today as Goodspeed Landing, and the \"South Division\" which finished the line to Saybrook Point.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\" /> The [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]] allowed for an easy construction, as no tunnels or major bridges where required.

The trackbed is gravel ballast, with track made of conventional wood crossties, with steel rails fastened to the ties. A major project funded by the Company in 2015 put all mainline track from Essex (MP 4) to North Chester (MP 9.80) in stone ballast. The track connects with [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Northeast Corridor]] track near the Old Saybrook Station to the south. Presently, 14.25 miles of the line are restored for train service, with the remaining last seeing service in 1968. The rail corridor between Haddam and Middletown, which has been cleared of brush and receives property maintenance and surveillance from hi-rail vehicles, and is undergoing full restoration as time and funding permit.\n\nThe Valley Railroad Company has several grade crossings along its tracks. They vary in their nature, ranging from small caution signs at Private Crossings to flashing lights, bells, and gates and stop signs at public crossings. The busiest public grade crossings are located at Route 153 in Essex, Route 154 in Essex, and Route 82 (just before the East Haddam swing bridge) in Haddam.\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:ESSEX FREIGHT STATION.jpg|thumb|The railroad's main station in Essex.]]\nThe main station, where tickets are sold and all [[rolling stock]] is kept, is located in Essex; specifically, the village of [[Centerbrook, Connecticut|Centerbrook]]. The main entrance and parking access is located off Route 154; there is a rear entrance (not for public use) on Route 153. There is a station building (used as offices for the riverboat operation) at Deep River Landing in Deep River, and a small station (used by the Railroad's track department) in Chester\u2014it was originally the station at Quinnipiac, Connecticut. Goodspeed station, located off Route 82 in Haddam, houses an antique shop and is not affiliated with the railroad. Across the tracks from the station is the Goodspeed Yard Office. This building was the original Chester passenger station, located on Dock Road in Chester, but sold off and removed in 1874 when it was found that the railroad grade was too steep at that location for starting and stopping trains. Donated by the Zanardi family in 1993, it was retrieved by volunteers of the Friends of the Valley Railroad and moved by flatcar to its present location. It is believed that this structure is the sole remaining passenger station from the 1871 opening of the railroad.\n\nOn July 18, 2009, the Friends of the Valley Railroad built a passenger shelter in Chester on the site of the original Hadlyme station. The new building is a reproduction of the South Britain station, which was on the now abandoned Danbury Extension of the Hartford, Providence & Fishkill. The original station on this site served passengers of the town of Hadlyme, across the Connecticut River. Passengers use today's station to go to Gillette Castle State Park via the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, the second-oldest continuously-operated ferry route in the United States.\n\n===Track Chart===\n0.00 - Old Saybrook\u201d <br>\n3.97 - Essex <br>\n7.58 - Deep River*\u2022 <br>\n8.57 - Chester* <br>\n9.26 - Hadlyme*\u2022 <br>\n9.65 - North Chester <br>\n10.40 - Parkers Point*\u201d <br>\n11.50 - Broadway*\u201d <br>\n12.27 - Goodspeed\u201d <br>\n14.00 - Shailerville\u201d <br>\n14.80 - Arnolds^ <br>\n15.48 - Haddam^ <br>\n16.90 - Walkley Hill^ <br>\n18.16 - Higganum^ <br>\n21.67 - Maromas^ <br>\n\nLegend: <br>\nNone - station stops <br>\n* - passes by station <br>\n^ - under construction <br>\n\u2022 - stops by on the way back to Essex <br>\n\u201c - special train stops <br>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trains|Connecticut}}\n\n* [[Connecticut Valley Railroad 40]]\n* [[Connecticut Valley Railroad 97]]\n* [[Connecticut Valley Railroad 3025]]\n* [[Connecticut Valley Railroad Roundhouse and Turntable Site]]\n* [[Deep River Freight Station]]\n* [[Essex Freight Station]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{cite web  |url=http://www.essexsteamtrain.com/history.html  |title=The History of the Valley Railroad Company  |work=essexsteamtrain.com  |access-date=October 1, 2012  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919184302/http://essexsteamtrain.com/history.html  |archive-date=September 19, 2012  |url-status=dead  |df=mdy-all  }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Valley Railroad (Connecticut)}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.essexsteamtrain.com/}}\n\n{{NYNH&H}}\n\n{{Coord|41.351652|-72.405986|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Valley Railroad Connecticut}}\n[[Category:Heritage railroads in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Essex, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Railway companies established in 1868]]\n[[Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1876]]\n[[Category:Heritage railroads in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail\n|railroad_name     = Valley Railroad\n|logo              = Valley RR logo.jpg\n|logo_size         = \n|logo_alt          = Valley Railroad Company Logo\n|system_map        = \n|map_caption       = \n|map_size          = \n|map_alt           =\n|image             = \n|image_size        = \n|image_caption     = \n|image_alt         =\n|marks             = VALE\n|locale            = [[Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n|start_year        = {{Start date| July 29, 1871 &ndash; March 30, 1968<br>July 29, 1971}}\n|end_year          = {{End date|present}}\n|predecessor_line  = [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]\n|successor_line    = \n|gauge             = {{Track gauge|sg|allk=on}}\n|old_gauge         =\n|electrification   = \n|length            = {{convert|21.67|mi|km}}\n|hq_city           = [[Essex, Connecticut]]\n|website           = {{URL|http://essexsteamtrain.com/}}\n| map = {{Valley_River_Line}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Valley Railroad''' is a [[heritage railway]] based in [[Connecticut]] on tracks of the Connecticut Valley Railroad, which was founded in 1868. It operates the '''Essex Steam Train''' and the '''Essex Clipper Dinner Train'''.\n\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===Essex Steam Train and Riverboat===\nThe Valley Railroad operates the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat. This excursion starts with a 11.36-mile ride aboard the historic Essex Steam Train from Essex Station with scenic views of the [[Connecticut River]] up to Chester. The train reverses direction back to the Deep River Station/Landing. Passengers who have purchased the riverboat tickets can board the ''Becky Thatcher'' at this station. The riverboat brings people on a 75-minute trip up the Connecticut River to the [[East Haddam Bridge|East Haddam Swing Bridge]] and then back to Deep River Landing. The train then retrieves passengers to bring them back to Essex Depot. Trip length is 150 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/the-train-boat/ |title=The Essex Steam Train and Riverboat |publisher=The Valley Railroad Company |location=[[Essex, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Essex Clipper Dinner Train===\nThe Essex Clipper Dinner Train is a 2.5-hour train ride that departs Essex Depot and offers scenic views of the [[Connecticut River]] along the way. The train brings passengers to the northern end of the operable line in Haddam. A seasonal four-course meal is prepared on-board and served in restored 1920s Pullman dining cars.\n\n===Day Out With Thomas===\nEach spring, [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas The Tank Engine]] and [[Percy the Small Engine|Percy The Small Green Engine]] bring [[Day out with Thomas|Day Out With Thomas]] to the Valley Railroad. The Essex Steam Train has participated in this event since the late 1990s and up until recently utilized the [[Strasburg Rail Road|Strasburg Railroad's]] fully steam-powered Thomas replica. However, as the locomotive was only available during the colder, late fall months, and as not to conflict with sales of their North Pole event, the Valley Railroad currently hosts their Day Out with Thomas in the Spring, using a non-powered Thomas which is pushed by one of their own steam locomotives.\n\n===North Pole Express===\nEach November and December, the North Pole Express brings passengers on an imaginary ride to the [[North Pole]] for children and their families. Amenities include on-board entertainment, singing, trackside displays, cookies, hot chocolate, and a gift from Santa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/special-events/north-pole-express/|title=The North Pole Express at the Essex Steam Train|publisher=The Valley Railroad Company|location=[[Essex, Connecticut]]}}</ref>\n\n===Santa Special===\nThe Santa Special is a daytime trip aboard festively-decorated rail cars. It is a shorter ride (60 minutes) without car hosts or refreshments. In 2018, the Santa Special hosted the Elf Academy where passengers learn the skills necessary to become an elf (laughing, singing and dancing) and meet Santa and Mrs. Claus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://essexsteamtrain.com/special-events/santa-special/|title=The Santa Special at the Essex Steam Train|publisher=The Valley Railroad Company|location=[[Essex, Connecticut]]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bridge remains along Fenwick Branch causeway, December 2016.JPG|thumb|left|Remains of a wooden bridge along the former Fenwick Branch south of Old Saybrook, which was abandoned in the early 20th century]]\n\n===Construction===\nThe vision of a Valley Railroad started in the 1840s when President of the Charter Oak Life Insurance Company, [[James Clark Walkley]] traced the 44-mile route by stagecoach with friend Horace Johnson.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://articles.courant.com/1999-04-21/news/9904180025_1_saybrook-point-passenger-coach-train |title=Essex Steam Train Is Remnant Of Connecticut Valley Railroad |publisher=The Hartford Courant |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 2, 2014 }}</ref> Walkley and a group of business men obtained a state charter on July 17, 1868, to form the Connecticut Valley Railroad Company and start the process of building a railroad.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\" />\n\nDuring 1868\u20131869, survey crews worked to map out the line from [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to [[Old Saybrook Center, Connecticut|Saybrook Point]].\n\nIn April 1870, construction of the line began, with ground breaking taking place in [[Higganum, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"DEEPHistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2716&q=433674&deepNav_GID=1650 |title=Connecticut Valley Railroad State Park |publisher=Connecticut DEEP |location=[[Hartford, Connecticut]] | access-date=August 2, 2014 }}</ref> The plan called for three phases, the \"Northern Division\" starting in Hartford and continuing to [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]],  the \"Middle Division\" which continued to what is known today as Goodspeed Landing, and the \"South Division\" which finished the line to Saybrook Point.<ref name=\"CourantHistory\" /> The [[Connecticut River|Connecticut River Valley]] allowed for an easy construction, as no tunnels or major bridges where required.

The trackbed is gravel ballast, with track made of conventional wood crossties, with steel rails fastened to the ties. A major project funded by the Company in 2015 put all mainline track from Essex (MP 4) to North Chester (MP 9.80) in stone ballast. The track connects with [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] [[Northeast Corridor]] track near the Old Saybrook Station to the south. Presently, 14.25 miles of the line are restored for train service, with the remaining last seeing service in 1968. The rail corridor between Haddam and Middletown, which has been cleared of brush and receives property maintenance and surveillance from hi-rail vehicles, and is undergoing full restoration as time and funding permit.\n\nThe Valley Railroad Company has several grade crossings along its tracks. They vary in their nature, ranging from small caution signs at Private Crossings to flashing lights, bells, and gates and stop signs at public crossings. The busiest public grade crossings are located at Route 153 in Essex, Route 154 in Essex, and Route 82 (just before the East Haddam swing bridge) in Haddam.\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:ESSEX FREIGHT STATION.jpg|thumb|The railroad's main station in Essex.]]\nThe main station, where tickets are sold and all [[rolling stock]] is kept, is located in Essex; specifically, the village of [[Centerbrook, Connecticut|Centerbrook]]. The main entrance and parking access is located off Route 154; there is a rear entrance (not for public use) on Route 153. There is a station building (used as offices for the riverboat operation) at Deep River Landing in Deep River, and a small station (used by the Railroad's track department) in Chester\u2014it was originally the station at Quinnipiac, Connecticut. Goodspeed station, located off Route 82 in Haddam, houses an antique shop and is not affiliated with the railroad. Across the tracks from the station is the Goodspeed Yard Office. This building was the original Chester passenger station, located on Dock Road in Chester, but sold off and removed in 1874 when it was found that the railroad grade was too steep at that location for starting and stopping trains. Donated by the Zanardi family in 1993, it was retrieved by volunteers of the Friends of the Valley Railroad and moved by flatcar to its present location. It is believed that this structure is the sole remaining passenger station from the 1871 opening of the railroad.\n\nOn July 18, 2009, the Friends of the Valley Railroad built a passenger shelter in Chester on the site of the original Hadlyme station.

Failing to prevent the joining of French Admiral [[Pierre Charles Silvestre de Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve's]] fleet to the squadron of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and to strike the shattering blow that would have freed Great Britain from the danger<ref name=\"Brytant p. 154\"/> of an invasion, Calder was later court-martialled and severely reprimanded for his failure and for avoiding the renewal of the engagement on 23 and 24 July. At the same time, in the aftermath Villeneuve elected not to continue on to [[Brest, France|Brest]], where his fleet could have joined with other French ships to clear the [[English Channel]] for an invasion of Great Britain.\n\n== Strategic background ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\nThe fragile [[Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 had come to an end when Napoleon formally annexed the Italian state of [[Piedmont]] and on 18 May 1803 Britain was once again at war with France.\n\n[[Napoleon]] planned to end the British blockade by invading and conquering Britain. By 1805 his ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre]]'' was 150,000 strong and encamped at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. If this army could cross the English Channel, victory over the poorly trained and equipped militias was very likely. The plan was that the French navy would escape from the British blockades of [[Toulon]] and Brest and threaten to attack the [[West Indies]], thus drawing off the British defence of the [[Western Approaches]]. The combined fleets would rendezvous at [[Martinique]] and then double back to Europe, land troops in Ireland to raise a rebellion, defeat the weakened British patrols in the Channel, and help transport the Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre across the [[Straits of Dover]].\n\nVilleneuve sailed from Toulon on 29 March 1805 with eleven [[ships of the line]], six [[frigate]]s and two [[brig]]s. He evaded Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s blockading fleet and passed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on 8 April. At [[C\u00e1diz]] he drove off the British blockading squadron and was joined by six Spanish ships of the line. The combined fleet sailed for the West Indies, reaching Martinique on 12 May.\n\nNelson was kept in the Mediterranean by westerly winds and did not pass the Strait until 7 May 1805. The British fleet of ten ships reached [[Antigua]] on 4 June.\n\nVilleneuve waited at Martinique for Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s Brest fleet to join him, but it remained blockaded in port and did not appear. Pleas from French army officers for Villeneuve to attack British colonies went unheeded &mdash; except for the recapture of the island fort of [[Diamond Rock]] &mdash; until 4 June when he set out from Martinique. On 7 June he learned from a captured British merchantman that Nelson had arrived at Antigua, and on 11 June Villeneuve left for Europe, having failed to achieve any of his objectives in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile in the [[Antilles]], the Franco-Spanish fleet ran into a British convoy worth 5 million [[franc]]s escorted by the frigate ''Barbadoes'', 28 guns, and [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Netley''. Villeneuve hoisted general chase and two French frigates with the Spanish ship ''Argonauta'', 80 guns, captured all the ships but one escort.\n\nOn 30 June the combined squadron captured and burned an English 14-gun [[privateer]]. On 3 July the fleet recaptured Spanish galleon ''Matilda'', which carried an estimated 15 million franc treasure, from English privateer ''Mars'', from Liverpool, which was towing ''Matilda'' to an English harbour. The privateer was burned and the merchant was taken in tow by the {{ship|French frigate|Sir\u00e8ne|1795|2|up=yes}}.\n\nThe fleet sailed back to Europe, and on 9 July the French ship ''Indomptable'' lost its main spar in a gale that damaged some other vessels slightly. The Atlantic crossings had been very difficult according to Spanish Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] who had crossed the Atlantic eleven times. So with some ships in bad condition, tired crews and scarce victuals, the combined fleet sighted land near Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of Cape Finisterre.jpg|thumb|The fleets line up for battle, painting by [[William Anderson (artist)|William Anderson]]]]\n[[File:Calder's Action.jpg|thumb|''Defiance'', ''Windsor Castle'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Repulse'', ''Raisonable'', and ''Glory'', an engraving after [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n[[File:Admiral Sir Robert Calder&#039;s Action off Cape Finisterre, 23 July 1805 RMG BHC0540.tiff|thumb|Calder\u2019s ship the \u2018'Prince of Wales\u2019' in the foreground, his fleet subdued in the patchy fog, by William Anderson]]\nNews of the returning French fleet reached Vice Admiral [[Robert Calder]] on 19 July. He was ordered to lift his blockade of the ports of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and sail for Cape Finisterre to intercept Villeneuve.<ref>[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Navy_List_1805/Ship_Duties/Off_Port.html]</ref> The fleets sighted each other at about 11:00 on 22 July.\n\nAfter several hours of manoeuvring to the south-west, the action began at about 17:15 as the British fleet, with ''Hero'' (Captain [[Alan Gardner, 2nd Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]]) in the vanguard, bore down on the Franco-Spanish line of battle. In poor visibility, the battle became a confused melee. ''Malta'' formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, the commander of ''Malta'' [[Sir Edward Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Buller]] found that he was surrounded by five Spanish ships.<ref name=\"Adkin56\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Tracy66\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=66}}</ref> After a fierce engagement in which ''Malta'' suffered five killed and forty wounded the British ship battled it out, sending out devastating broadsides from both port and starboard. At about 20:00 Buller forced the Spanish 80-gun ''San Rafael'' to strike, and afterwards sent the ''Malta''{{'}}s boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun ''Firme''.<ref name=\"Tracy66\"/><ref name=\"ABO72\">{{cite book| title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|year=1825|page=72}}</ref><ref name=\"GM760\">{{cite book| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|year=1805|page=760}}</ref> Calder signalled to break-off the action at 20:25, aiming to continue the battle the next day. In the failing light and general confusion some ships continued to fire for another hour.\n\nDaybreak on 23 July found the fleets {{convert|27|km|mi}} apart. Calder was unwilling to attack a second time against superior odds, he had to protect the damaged ''Windsor Castle'' and ''Malta'' with her large captured Spanish prizes and he had to consider the possibility that the previously blockaded fleets at Rochefort and Ferrol might put to sea and effect a junction with Villeneuve's combined fleet. Accordingly, he declined to attack and headed northeast with his prizes.\n\nVilleneuve's report claims that at first he intended to attack, but in the very light breezes it took all day to come up to the British and he decided not to risk combat late in the day. On 24 July a change in the wind put the Franco-Spanish fleet to the windward of the British &mdash; the ideal position for an attack &mdash; but instead of attacking, Villeneuve turned away to the south. When he arrived at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] on 1 August he received orders from Napoleon to proceed immediately to Brest and Boulogne, but perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, he returned to [[C\u00e1diz]], reaching that port on 21 August.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle was inconclusive and both admirals, Villeneuve and Calder, claimed victory.<ref>Brytant p. 153</ref> The British human losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the Franco-Spanish losses 476 officers and men killed and wounded, with a further 800 ill.<ref>Weighly 1991, p. 343: Villeneuve reported to Paris on the day of the battle that he had 800 of his fleet \"sick\", and that everything capable of going wrong was doing so.</ref> Calder was relieved of his command, court-martialled, and sentenced to be severely reprimanded for his failure to renew the battle on 23 and 24 July.  He never served at sea again. Villeneuve failed to push on Brest, retired to refit at Vigo, then slipped into Coru\u00f1a, and on 15 August decided to make for Cadiz.\nThe direction of Villeneuve on Cadiz ruined all hopes of Napoleon to make an invasion and landing on England, thus Napoleon, frustrated by Villeneuve's lack of \u00e9lan, was forced to abandon his plan of invading Britain. Instead, the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'', renamed the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', left Boulogne on 27 August to counter the threat from Austria and Russia. A few weeks after the battle he wrote: \"[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory.\"\n\nVilleneuve and the combined fleets remained at C\u00e1diz until they came out to their destruction at the [[battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October.\n\n{{cquote|\"If Admiral Villeneuve, instead of entering Ferrol, had contented himself with rallying at the Spanish squadron, and had sailed for Brest to join Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Gantheaume]], my army would have landed; it would have been all over with England.\"|20|20|General [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], 8th Sept, 1815.<ref>The London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences... p. 706</ref>}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===British fleet===\n*Calder had fifteen ships of the line ({{HMS|Prince of Wales|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Glory|1788|2}}, {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|2}}, {{HMS|Windsor Castle|1790|2}}, {{HMS|Malta|1800|2}}, {{HMS|Thunderer|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Repulse|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Defiance|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Ajax|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Dragon|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Triumph|1764|2}}, {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}}, and {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|2}}), two frigates ({{ship|French frigate|Egyptienne|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|2}}), and two smaller vessels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 |Ship\n! colspan=2 |Casualties\n! colspan=3 |Damage\n|-\n!<small>Dead</small>\n!<small>Wounded</small>\n!Rigging\n!Masts and spars\n!Hull and others\n|-\n|{{HMS|Hero|1803|2}} (74), Capt.

Failing to prevent the joining of French Admiral [[Pierre Charles Silvestre de Villeneuve|Pierre de Villeneuve's]] fleet to the squadron of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and to strike the shattering blow that would have freed Great Britain from the danger<ref name=\"Brytant p. 154\"/> of an invasion, Calder was later court-martialled and severely reprimanded for his failure and for avoiding the renewal of the engagement on 23 and 24 July. At the same time, in the aftermath Villeneuve elected not to continue on to [[Brest, France|Brest]], where his fleet could have joined with other French ships to clear the [[English Channel]] for an invasion of Great Britain.\n\n== Strategic background ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\nThe fragile [[Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 had come to an end when Napoleon formally annexed the Italian state of [[Piedmont]] and on 18 May 1803 Britain was once again at war with France.\n\n[[Napoleon]] planned to end the British blockade by invading and conquering Britain. By 1805 his ''[[Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre]]'' was 150,000 strong and encamped at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]]. If this army could cross the English Channel, victory over the poorly trained and equipped militias was very likely. The plan was that the French navy would escape from the British blockades of [[Toulon]] and Brest and threaten to attack the [[West Indies]], thus drawing off the British defence of the [[Western Approaches]]. The combined fleets would rendezvous at [[Martinique]] and then double back to Europe, land troops in Ireland to raise a rebellion, defeat the weakened British patrols in the Channel, and help transport the Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre across the [[Straits of Dover]].\n\nVilleneuve sailed from Toulon on 29 March 1805 with eleven [[ships of the line]], six [[frigate]]s and two [[brig]]s. He evaded Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s blockading fleet and passed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] on 8 April. At [[C\u00e1diz]] he drove off the British blockading squadron and was joined by six Spanish ships of the line. The combined fleet sailed for the West Indies, reaching Martinique on 12 May.\n\nNelson was kept in the Mediterranean by westerly winds and did not pass the Strait until 7 May 1805. The British fleet of ten ships reached [[Antigua]] on 4 June.\n\nVilleneuve waited at Martinique for Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s Brest fleet to join him, but it remained blockaded in port and did not appear. Pleas from French army officers for Villeneuve to attack British colonies went unheeded &mdash; except for the recapture of the island fort of [[Diamond Rock]] &mdash; until 4 June when he set out from Martinique. On 7 June he learned from a captured British merchantman that Nelson had arrived at Antigua, and on 11 June Villeneuve left for Europe, having failed to achieve any of his objectives in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile in the [[Antilles]], the Franco-Spanish fleet ran into a British convoy worth 5 million [[franc]]s escorted by the frigate ''Barbadoes'', 28 guns, and [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Netley''. Villeneuve hoisted general chase and two French frigates with the Spanish ship ''Argonauta'', 80 guns, captured all the ships but one escort.\n\nOn 30 June the combined squadron captured and burned an English 14-gun [[privateer]]. On 3 July the fleet recaptured Spanish galleon ''Matilda'', which carried an estimated 15 million franc treasure, from English privateer ''Mars'', from Liverpool, which was towing ''Matilda'' to an English harbour. The privateer was burned and the merchant was taken in tow by the {{ship|French frigate|Sir\u00e8ne|1795|2|up=yes}}.\n\nThe fleet sailed back to Europe, and on 9 July the French ship ''Indomptable'' lost its main spar in a gale that damaged some other vessels slightly. The Atlantic crossings had been very difficult according to Spanish Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] who had crossed the Atlantic eleven times. So with some ships in bad condition, tired crews and scarce victuals, the combined fleet sighted land near Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Battle of Cape Finisterre.jpg|thumb|The fleets line up for battle, painting by [[William Anderson (artist)|William Anderson]]]]\n[[File:Calder's Action.jpg|thumb|''Defiance'', ''Windsor Castle'', ''Prince of Wales'', ''Repulse'', ''Raisonable'', and ''Glory'', an engraving after [[Thomas Whitcombe]]]]\n[[File:Admiral Sir Robert Calder&#039;s Action off Cape Finisterre, 23 July 1805 RMG BHC0540.tiff|thumb|Calder\u2019s ship the \u2018'Prince of Wales\u2019' in the foreground, his fleet subdued in the patchy fog, by William Anderson]]\nNews of the returning French fleet reached Vice Admiral [[Robert Calder]] on 19 July. He was ordered to lift his blockade of the ports of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] and sail for Cape Finisterre to intercept Villeneuve.<ref>[http://www.pbenyon.plus.com/Navy_List_1805/Ship_Duties/Off_Port.html]</ref> The fleets sighted each other at about 11:00 on 22 July.\n\nAfter several hours of manoeuvring to the south-west, the action began at about 17:15 as the British fleet, with ''Hero'' (Captain [[Alan Gardner, 2nd Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]]) in the vanguard, bore down on the Franco-Spanish line of battle. In poor visibility, the battle became a confused melee. ''Malta'' formed the rear-most ship in the British line in the approach to the battle, but as the fleets became confused in the failing light and thick patchy fog, the commander of ''Malta'' [[Sir Edward Buller, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Buller]] found that he was surrounded by five Spanish ships.<ref name=\"Adkin56\">{{cite book |last=Adkin |title=The Trafalgar Companion |page=56}}</ref><ref name=\"Tracy66\">{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's who in Nelson's Navy |page=66}}</ref> After a fierce engagement in which ''Malta'' suffered five killed and forty wounded the British ship battled it out, sending out devastating broadsides from both port and starboard. At about 20:00 Buller forced the Spanish 80-gun ''San Rafael'' to strike, and afterwards sent the ''Malta''{{'}}s boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun ''Firme''.<ref name=\"Tracy66\"/><ref name=\"ABO72\">{{cite book| title=The Annual Biography and Obituary|year=1825|page=72}}</ref><ref name=\"GM760\">{{cite book| title=[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]|year=1805|page=760}}</ref> Calder signalled to break-off the action at 20:25, aiming to continue the battle the next day. In the failing light and general confusion some ships continued to fire for another hour.\n\nDaybreak on 23 July found the fleets {{convert|27|km|mi}} apart. Calder was unwilling to attack a second time against superior odds, he had to protect the damaged ''Windsor Castle'' and ''Malta'' with her large captured Spanish prizes and he had to consider the possibility that the previously blockaded fleets at Rochefort and Ferrol might put to sea and effect a junction with Villeneuve's combined fleet. Accordingly, he declined to attack and headed northeast with his prizes.\n\nVilleneuve's report claims that at first he intended to attack, but in the very light breezes it took all day to come up to the British and he decided not to risk combat late in the day. On 24 July a change in the wind put the Franco-Spanish fleet to the windward of the British &mdash; the ideal position for an attack &mdash; but instead of attacking, Villeneuve turned away to the south. When he arrived at [[A Coru\u00f1a]] on 1 August he received orders from Napoleon to proceed immediately to Brest and Boulogne, but perhaps believing a false report of a superior British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, he returned to [[C\u00e1diz]], reaching that port on 21 August.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe battle was inconclusive and both admirals, Villeneuve and Calder, claimed victory.<ref>Brytant p. 153</ref> The British human losses were 39 officers and men killed and 159 wounded; the Franco-Spanish losses 476 officers and men killed and wounded, with a further 800 ill.<ref>Weighly 1991, p. 343: Villeneuve reported to Paris on the day of the battle that he had 800 of his fleet \"sick\", and that everything capable of going wrong was doing so.</ref> Calder was relieved of his command, court-martialled, and sentenced to be severely reprimanded for his failure to renew the battle on 23 and 24 July.  He never served at sea again. Villeneuve failed to push on Brest, retired to refit at Vigo, then slipped into Coru\u00f1a, and on 15 August decided to make for Cadiz.\nThe direction of Villeneuve on Cadiz ruined all hopes of Napoleon to make an invasion and landing on England, thus Napoleon, frustrated by Villeneuve's lack of \u00e9lan, was forced to abandon his plan of invading Britain. Instead, the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'', renamed the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', left Boulogne on 27 August to counter the threat from Austria and Russia. A few weeks after the battle he wrote: \"[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Gravina]] is all genius and decision in combat. If Villeneuve had had those qualities, the battle of Finisterre would have been a complete victory.\"\n\nVilleneuve and the combined fleets remained at C\u00e1diz until they came out to their destruction at the [[battle of Trafalgar]] on 21 October.\n\n{{cquote|\"If Admiral Villeneuve, instead of entering Ferrol, had contented himself with rallying at the Spanish squadron, and had sailed for Brest to join Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Gantheaume]], my army would have landed; it would have been all over with England.\"|20|20|General [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], 8th Sept, 1815.<ref>The London literary gazette and journal of belles lettres, arts, sciences... p. 706</ref>}}\n\n==Order of battle==\n===British fleet===\n*Calder had fifteen ships of the line ({{HMS|Prince of Wales|1794|2}}, {{HMS|Glory|1788|2}}, {{HMS|Barfleur|1768|2}}, {{HMS|Windsor Castle|1790|2}}, {{HMS|Malta|1800|2}}, {{HMS|Thunderer|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Hero|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Repulse|1803|2}}, {{HMS|Defiance|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Ajax|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1781|2}}, {{HMS|Dragon|1798|2}}, {{HMS|Triumph|1764|2}}, {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}}, and {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|2}}), two frigates ({{ship|French frigate|Egyptienne|1799|2}} and {{HMS|Sirius|1797|2}}), and two smaller vessels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 |Ship\n! colspan=2 |Casualties\n! colspan=3 |Damage\n|-\n!<small>Dead</small>\n!<small>Wounded</small>\n!Rigging\n!Masts and spars\n!Hull and others\n|-\n|{{HMS|Hero|1803|2}} (74), Capt.

Corbitt introduced Young to a bluegrass musician, Lowell Levinger (born Lowell Vincent Levinger III, September 9, 1944 [Manhatten]]). Levinger, known as \"Banana\", could play the piano, [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[mandola]], guitar and bass; he had played in the Proper Bostonians and the Trolls, and played mainly piano and guitar in the Youngbloods. He knew of a fellow tenant who could flesh out the band, Joe Bauer (born September 26, 1941, [[Memphis, Tennessee]]), an aspiring [[jazz]] drummer with experience playing in society dance bands.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Small gigs to recording success===\nOnce the line-up was set, Jesse Colin Young and the Youngbloods, as the group was then known, began building a reputation from their club dates. (Early demo sides from 1965 were later issued by [[Mercury Records]] on the ''Two Trips'' album.)

Once the tour was completed, the group disbanded once again by mid-1985.\n\nFollowing the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], the media conglomerate [[Clear Channel Communications]] included the Youngbloods' recording of \"Get Together\" on a [[2001 Clear Channel memorandum|list of \"lyrically questionable\" songs]] that was sent to its 1,200 radio stations in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nJerry Corbitt died of lung cancer on March 8, 2014.
