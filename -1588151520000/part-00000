His significance in the Hellenic psyche, due to its involvement in Alexander's death, may have also contributed to the choice of Osiris-Apis as the chief Ptolemaic god.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], Ptolemy stole the [[cult image|cult statue]] from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Asia Minor, having been instructed in a dream by the \"unknown god\" to bring the statue to [[Alexandria]], where the statue was pronounced to be Sarapis by two religious experts. One of the experts was of the [[Eumolpidae]], the ancient family from whose members the [[hierophant]] of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] had been chosen since before history, and the other was the scholarly Egyptian priest [[Manetho]], which gave weight to the judgement both for the [[Egyptians]] and the Greeks.\n\nPlutarch may not be correct, however, as some Egyptologists allege that the \"Sinope\" in the tale is really the hill of Sinopeion, a name given to the site of the already existing [[Serapeum]] at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Also, according to [[Gaius Cornelius Tacitus|Tacitus]], Serapis (i.e., Apis explicitly identified as Osiris in full) had been the god of the village of [[Rhakotis]] before it expanded into the great capital of Alexandria.\n\n[[File:Altes Museum - Oberbeamter im Serapis-Kult.jpg|thumb|upright|left|High Clerk in the Cult of Serapis, [[Altes Museum]], [[Berlin]]]]\nThe statue suitably depicted a figure resembling [[Hades]] or [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]], both being kings of the Greek [[underworld]], and was shown enthroned with the [[modius (headdress)|modius]], a basket/grain-measure, on his head, since it was a Greek [[symbol]] for the land of the dead. He also held a [[sceptre]] in his hand indicating his rulership, with [[Cerberus]], gatekeeper of the underworld, resting at his feet. The statue also had what appeared to be a [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] at its base, fitting the Egyptian symbol of rulership, the [[uraeus]].\n\nWith his (i.e. Osiris's) wife [[Isis]], and their son [[Horus]] (in the form of [[Harpocrates]]), Serapis won an important place in the [[Greco-Roman world|Greek world]].

At Rome, Serapis was worshiped in the [[Iseum Campense]], the sanctuary of Isis built during the [[Second Triumvirate]] in the [[Campus Martius]]. The Roman cults of Isis and Serapis gained in popularity late in the 1st century when [[Vespasian]] experienced events he attributed to their miraculous agency while he was in Alexandria, where he stayed before returning to Rome as emperor in 70. From the [[Flavian Dynasty]] on, Serapis was one of the deities who might appear on imperial coinage with the reigning emperor.\n\nThe main cult at Alexandria survived until the late 4th century, when a [[Serapeum of Alexandria#Destruction|Christian mob destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria]] in 385. The [[Edict of Thessalonica|Theodosian decree]] of 380 implicitly included the cult in its general proscription of religions other than approved forms of Nicene Christianity.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Head of a God, 1st century C.E., 58.79.1.jpg|Head of Sarapis, 1st century BCE, 58.79.1 [[Brooklyn Museum]]\nFile:Serapis Louvre AO1027.jpg|Head of Serapis, Carthage, Tunisia\nImage:Serapis.JPG|Oil lamp with a bust of Serapis, flanked by a crescent moon and star (Roman-era [[Ephesus]], 100\u2013150)\nImage:BegramSerapis.jpg|Statuette possibly of Serapis (but note the [[Heracles|herculean]] club) from [[Begram]], [[Afghanistan]]\nImage:Head of Sarapis 150 200 CE Archeological Museum of Thessaloniki.JPG|Head of Sarapis (150\u2013200)\nImage:SarapisHead.jpg|Head of Serapis, from a {{convert|12|ft|m|order=flip|adj=on}} statue found off the coast of Alexandria\nFile:Serapis on Roman Egypt, Alexandria, Billon Tetradrachm.jpg|Serapis on Roman Egypt, [[Alexandria]], Billon Tetradrachm\nFile:Kopf des Serapis.jpg|Head of Serapis (Roman-era Hellenistic terracotta, Staatliches Museum \u00c4gyptischer Kunst, Munich)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Serapeum]]\n* [[Serapis Bey]], the [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] in charge of the Ascension Temple\n* [[Greeks in Egypt]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |author1-last=Borgeaud |author1-first=Philippe |author2-last=Volokhine |author2-first=Yuri |title=La formation de la l\u00e9gende de Sarapis: une approche transculturelle |language=French |journal=Archiv f\u00fcr Religionsgeschichte |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=2000}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |title=De Memphis \u00e0 Rome: Actes du Ier Colloque international sur les \u00e9tudes isiaques, Poitiers \u2013 Futuroscope, 8\u201310 avril 1999 |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004117365}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bricault |first=Laurent |title=Altas de la diffusion des cultes isiaques |language=French |year=2001 |publisher=Diffusion de Boccard |isbn=978-2-87754-123-7 }}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |title=Isis en Occident: Actes du II\u00e8me Colloque international sur les \u00e9tudes isiaques, Lyon III 16-17 mai 2002 |year=2003 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004132634}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bricault |first=Laurent |title=Recueil des inscriptions concernant les cultes isiaques (RICIS) |language=French |year=2005 |publisher=Diffusion de Boccard |isbn=978-2-87754-156-5}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |editor2-last=Veymiers | editor2-first=Richard |title=Bibliotheca Isiaca |year=2008\u20132014 |publisher=Editions Ausonius }} Vol. I: {{ISBN|978-2-910023-99-7}}; Vol. II: {{ISBN|978-2-356-13053-2}}; Vol. III: {{ISBN|978-2-356-13121-8}}.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |editor2-last=Versluys |editor2-first=Miguel John |editor3-last=Meyboom |editor3-first=Paul G.

The Roman cults of Isis and Serapis gained in popularity late in the 1st century when [[Vespasian]] experienced events he attributed to their miraculous agency while he was in Alexandria, where he stayed before returning to Rome as emperor in 70. From the [[Flavian Dynasty]] on, Serapis was one of the deities who might appear on imperial coinage with the reigning emperor.\n\nThe main cult at Alexandria survived until the late 4th century, when a [[Serapeum of Alexandria#Destruction|Christian mob destroyed the Serapeum of Alexandria]] in 385. The [[Edict of Thessalonica|Theodosian decree]] of 380 implicitly included the cult in its general proscription of religions other than approved forms of Nicene Christianity.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Head of a God, 1st century C.E., 58.79.1.jpg|Head of Sarapis, 1st century BCE, 58.79.1 [[Brooklyn Museum]]\nFile:Serapis Louvre AO1027.jpg|Head of Serapis, Carthage, Tunisia\nImage:Serapis.JPG|Oil lamp with a bust of Serapis, flanked by a crescent moon and star (Roman-era [[Ephesus]], 100\u2013150)\nImage:BegramSerapis.jpg|Statuette possibly of Serapis (but note the [[Heracles|herculean]] club) from [[Begram]], [[Afghanistan]]\nImage:Head of Sarapis 150 200 CE Archeological Museum of Thessaloniki.JPG|Head of Sarapis (150\u2013200)\nImage:SarapisHead.jpg|Head of Serapis, from a 12-foot statue found off the coast of Alexandria\nFile:Serapis on Roman Egypt, Alexandria, Billon Tetradrachm.jpg|Serapis on Roman Egypt, [[Alexandria]], Billon Tetradrachm\nFile:Kopf des Serapis.jpg|Head of Serapis (Roman-era Hellenistic terracotta, Staatliches Museum \u00c4gyptischer Kunst, Munich)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Serapeum]]\n* [[Serapis Bey]], the [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] in charge of the Ascension Temple\n* [[Greeks in Egypt]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |author1-last=Borgeaud |author1-first=Philippe |author2-last=Volokhine |author2-first=Yuri |title=La formation de la l\u00e9gende de Sarapis: une approche transculturelle |language=French |journal=Archiv f\u00fcr Religionsgeschichte |volume=2 |issue=1 |date=2000}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |title=De Memphis \u00e0 Rome: Actes du Ier Colloque international sur les \u00e9tudes isiaques, Poitiers \u2013 Futuroscope, 8\u201310 avril 1999 |year=2000 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004117365}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bricault |first=Laurent |title=Altas de la diffusion des cultes isiaques |language=French |year=2001 |publisher=Diffusion de Boccard |isbn=978-2-87754-123-7 }}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |title=Isis en Occident: Actes du II\u00e8me Colloque international sur les \u00e9tudes isiaques, Lyon III 16-17 mai 2002 |year=2003 |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004132634}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bricault |first=Laurent |title=Recueil des inscriptions concernant les cultes isiaques (RICIS) |language=French |year=2005 |publisher=Diffusion de Boccard |isbn=978-2-87754-156-5}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |editor2-last=Veymiers | editor2-first=Richard |title=Bibliotheca Isiaca |year=2008\u20132014 |publisher=Editions Ausonius }} Vol. I: {{ISBN|978-2-910023-99-7}}; Vol. II: {{ISBN|978-2-356-13053-2}}; Vol. III: {{ISBN|978-2-356-13121-8}}.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Bricault |editor1-first=Laurent |editor2-last=Versluys |editor2-first=Miguel John |editor3-last=Meyboom |editor3-first=Paul G.

[[Ancient Agora Museum]].]]\n'''Athenian democracy'''  developed around the sixth century BC in the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]] (known as a [[polis]]) of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of [[Attica]], is one of [[Greek democracy|ancient Greek democracy]], and is often described as the first known [[democracy]] in the world. Other Greek cities set up democracies, most following the Athenian model, but none are as well documented as Athens'.\n\nAthens practiced a [[political system]] of [[legislation]] and executive bills. Participation was not open to all residents, but was instead limited to adult, male citizens (i.e., not a [[metic|foreign resident]], a [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slave]], or a woman), who \"were probably no more than 30 percent of the total adult population\".<ref name=\"p. 74\">{{cite book|last=Thorley |first=John |title=Athenian Democracy |series=Lancaster Pamphlets in Ancient History |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 |page=74 |isbn=978-1-13-479335-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Solon]] (in 594 BC), [[Cleisthenes]] (in 508/7 BC), and [[Ephialtes]] (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth. The longest-lasting democratic leader was [[Pericles]]. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by [[oligarchic]] revolutions towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under [[Eucleides]]; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]] in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Democracy}}\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements ''d\u00eamos'' (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"people\") and ''kr\u00e1tos'' (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from ''arch\u0113'' (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect the term \"demarchy\" to have been adopted, by analogy, for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"[[mayoralty]]\", the office or rank of a high [[municipal]] [[magistrate]]. (In present-day use, the term \"[[demarchy]]\" has acquired a new meaning.)\n\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470BC with Aeschylus' [[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]] (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1. This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\" and in the context of the play acts as a counterpoint to the inclination of the votes cast by the people, i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has power. The word is then completely attested in the works of [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 6.43.3) in both a verbal passive and nominal sense with the terms \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 and  \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, who wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose, but this might not have been before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,<ref>Raaflaub, Kurt A. (2007): ''The Breakthrough of Demokratia in Mid-Fifth-Century Athens'', p. 112, in: {{cite book |editor1=Raaflaub, Kurt A. |editor2=Ober, Josiah |editor3=Wallace, Robert |title=Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}</ref> a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in [[Aeolis|Aeolian]] [[Temnus]].<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 4.4.15.</ref>///r+2(people power)///\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{mainarticle|Athenian Revolution}}\nAthens was never the only [[polis]] in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic regime. [[Aristotle]] points to other cities that adopted governments in the democratic style. However, accounts of the rise of democratic institutions are in reference to Athens, since only this city-state had sufficient historical records to speculate on the rise and nature of Greek democracy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qry16UDq83EC Clarke, PB. and Foweraker, ''Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought''.

Under these reforms, a council of 400 members (with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) called the ''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]'' ran daily affairs and set the political agenda.<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 10\"/> The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but subsequently carried on the role of \"guardianship of the laws\".<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', Areopagus.</ref> Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]'' or Assembly, which was open to all the male citizens.\n\n[[File:Cleisthenes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleisthenes]]]]\nIn 561 BC, the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant [[Peisistratos]] but was reinstated after the expulsion of his son, [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], in 510.

Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the [[Athenian coup of 411 BC]]. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by a more democratic government.

From a modern perspective these figures may seem small, but among Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000\u20131500 adult male citizens each; and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], a major power, had at most 15,000.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hN7pAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=corinth+population&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HPvXU62wI4TeOp-ogfgO&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=corinth%20population&f=false Dixon, MD., ''Late Classical and Early Hellenistic Corinth: 338\u2013196 BC'', Routledge, 2014, p. 44.]</ref>\n\nThe non-citizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners ([[metic]]s) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator [[Hyperides]] (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably no more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=calr-oiSrTEC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=hyperides+fragment+13+attica+slaves+150,000&source=bl&ots=DMiYE61pBU&sig=y_kT7I9-R7Gndh1Mp_rUcX9Xi4Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e5WAUsztNOTG7AbqxYHgDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hyperides%20fragment%2013%20attica%20slaves%20150%2C000&f=false Kamen, D., ''Status in Classical Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2013 p. 9.]</ref>\n\n===Citizenship in Athens===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[State]] -->\nOnly adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as [[Ephebos|ephebe]]s had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10% to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\"/> This excluded a majority of the population: [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]], freed slaves, children, women and [[metic]]s (foreigners\nresident in Athens).<ref>[http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/slaves_and_resident_aliens.html agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised II \u2013 Slaves and Resident Aliens]</ref> The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted movement in public, and were very segregated from the men.<ref>[http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/women.html agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised I \u2013 Women]</ref>\n\nAlso excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see [[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]); for some Athenians, this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of citizenship held by Greek [[city-states]], a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it, compared to oligarchies and aristocracies.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\" />\n\nSome Athenian citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\"/> Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens; after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC, only those descended from two Athenian parents could claim citizenship.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, p.59.</ref> Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later, when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king to be distributed among all citizens, many \"illegitimate\" citizens were removed from the registers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v0yJ9fECG88C&pg=PA278&dq=plutarch+pericles+grain+egypt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z8rUU8KLC4rb7AaOo4GwCg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=plutarch%20pericles%20grain%20egypt&f=false  Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., ''The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law'' Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 278.]</ref>\n\nCitizenship applied to both individuals and their descendants. It could also be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups (e.g. [[Platea]]ns in 427 BC and [[Samians]] in 405 BC). However, by the 4th century, citizenship was given only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century, the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousands.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RxH3UcC2FYwC&dq=athens+citizenship+grant&q=%22citizenship+was+not%22#v=snippet&q=%22citizenship%20was%20not%22&f=false Sinclair, RK.,''Democracy and Participation in Athens'', Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp.&nbsp;25\u201326.]</ref>\n\n==Main bodies of government==\n[[File:Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-the-4th-century-BC.png|thumb|center|900px|Constitution of the Athenians, 4th century BC]]There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]''), and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, on some occasions up to 6,000). Of these three bodies, the assembly and the courts were the true sites of power \u2013 although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the ''demos'' ('the people'), as they were manned by just those citizens over thirty. Crucially, citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution, as were council members and all other officeholders.\n\nIn the 5th century BC, there is often a record of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6,000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century, however, the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial.\n\n===Ecclesia===\n{{Main|Ecclesia (ancient Athens)}}\nThe central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly]] ({{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda''). Unlike a [[parliament]], the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was [[direct democracy|direct]], rather than [[representative democracy|representative]]: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.32.]</ref> and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called [[sortition]].\n\nThe assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner), elected some officials, legislated, and tried political crimes. As the system evolved, the last function was shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position, followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no.\n\nThough there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on important matters, there were no political parties and likewise no [[Forms of government|government]] or [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] (as in the [[Westminster system]]). Voting was by simple [[majority rule|majority]]. In the 5th century at least, there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the assembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.57.]</ref>\n\nAs usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, ''kheirotonia'', 'arm stretching') with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could cause problems when it became too dark to see properly. However, any member could demand that officials issue a recount.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p&nbsp;33\u201334.]</ref> For a small category of votes, a quorum of 6,000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small coloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. [[Ostracism]] required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery (\u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1, ''ostraka''), though this did not occur within the assembly as such.\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|250px|The [[Pnyx]] with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens.]]\n\nIn the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten [[Attic calendar#State calendar|state months]], with other meetings called as needed. In the following century, the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting, ''kyria ekklesia''. Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly, rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RBcABAAAQBAJ&dq=athens+assembly+frequency&q=%22assembly+normally%22#v=snippet&q=%22assembly%20normally%22&f=false Manville, PB., ''The Origins of Citizenship in Ancient Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2014 p. 182.]</ref>\n\nAttendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century, public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the [[agora]] into the assembly meeting place ([[Pnyx]]), with a fine being imposed on those who got the red on their clothes.<ref>[[Aristophanes]] ''Acharnians'' 17\u201322.</ref> After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6,000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.<ref>Aristoph. ''Ekklesiazousai'' 378-9</ref>\n\n===The Boule===\n{{Main|Boule (ancient Greece)#The Athenian Boule}}\nIn 594 BC, Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of the assembly.<ref>Terry Buckley, Aspects of Greek History: ''A Source-Based Approach'', Routledge, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pxqIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 p. 98].</ref> After the reforms of Cleisthenes, the Athenian Boule was expanded to 500 and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleisthenes's 10 tribes provided 50 councilors who were at least 30 years old. The Boule's roles in public affairs included finance, maintaining the military's cavalry and fleet of ships, advising the [[Strategos|generals]], approving of newly elected magistrates, and receiving ambassadors. Most importantly, the Boule would draft ''probouleumata'', or deliberations for the Ecclesia to discuss and approve on. During emergencies, the Ecclesia would also grant special temporary powers to the Boule.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': boule.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCleisthenes restricted the Boule's membership to those of [[zeugitai]] status (and above), presumably because these classes' financial interests gave them an incentive towards effective governance. A member had to be approved by his deme, each of which would have an incentive to select those with experience in local politics and the greatest likelihood at effective participation in government.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&q=%22those+of+zeugitai+status%22#v=snippet&q=%22those%20of%20zeugitai%20status%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;31\u201332]</ref>\n\nThe members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act as a standing committee (the ''[[prytaneis]]'') of the Boule for a period of thirty-six days. All fifty members of the prytaneis on duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the ''[[Prytaneion#Tholos, Athens|Prytaneion]]'', a building adjacent to the ''[[bouleuterion]]'', where the boule met. A chairman for each tribe was chosen by lot each day, who was required to stay in the tholos for the next 24 hours, presiding over meetings of the Boule and Assembly.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&q=%22those+of+zeugitai+status%22#v=snippet&q=%22those%20of%20zeugitai%20status%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;30\u201331.]</ref>\n\nThe boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances.<ref>Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 238</ref> Altogether, the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was executed in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the former, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter, it merely executed the wishes of the assembly.<ref>Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 241</ref>\n\n===Courts===\nAthens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see ''[[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]''). The age limit of 30 or older, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly. Jurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates), who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least acclaimed by defendants, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvyoMAUCTh8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Dover, KJ., ''Greek Popular Morality in the Time of Plato and Aristotle'', Hackett Publishing, 1994, p.23.]</ref>\n\nEssentially there were two grades of a suit, a smaller kind known as ''dike'' (\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) or private suit, and a larger kind known as ''graphe'' or public suit. For private suits, the minimum jury size was 200 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. Under Cleisthenes's reforms, juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000 in total.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, pp.&nbsp;36\u201338.</ref> For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see ''[[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]]''), all 6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=92_Nz8jjrSUC&pg=PA36&dq=athens+court+jury+6000&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vPHUU8nZFaSV7Ab8qYCoCw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%206000&f=false MacDowell, DM., ''The Law in Classical Athens'', Cornell University Press, 1978, p.36.]</ref>\n[[File:Water Clock in Ancient Agora of Athens.jpg|thumb|Water Clock in the Ancient Agora of Athens.]]\nThe cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by a [[water clock]] or ''clepsydra'', first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (''ho boulomenos'', 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole.\n\nJustice was rapid: a case could last no longer than one day and had to be completed by the time the sun set.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8D_--jaxt3EC&pg=PA1013&dq=athens+court+jury+%22one+day%22+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J_jUU77MOonB7AbrsIHYAw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%20%22one%20day%22%20-georgia%20-ohio&f=false Bertoch, MJ., The Greeks had a jury for it, ''ABA Journal'', October, 1971, Vol. 57, p.1013.]</ref> Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbeFkmvXB0C&pg=PA167&dq=athens+court+jury+penalty+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3_nUU5cfobDsBqbFgZAJ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%20penalty%20-georgia%20-ohio&f=false Arnason, JP., Raaflaub, KA. and Wagner, P., ''The Greek Polis and the Invention of Democracy: A Politico-cultural Transformation and Its Interpretations'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013' p. 167.]</ref> No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict.\n\nPayment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to [[Pericles]], a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (''Politics'' 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 [[obol (coin)|obol]]s by [[Cleon]] early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fkjzwJxCA4C&pg=PA235&dq=athens+court+jury+financial+crisis+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hPbUU_TJCumr7AaJ74HQDQ&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=suspension&f=false Rhodes, PJ., ''A History of the Classical Greek World: 478 \u2013 323 BC'', John Wiley & Sons, 2011, p. 235.]</ref>\n\nThe system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts, nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors. Magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies in Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter or [[Logographer (legal)|logographer]] (''logographos''), but this may not have been advertised in court. Jurors would likely be more impressed if it seemed as though litigants were speaking for themselves.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=92_Nz8jjrSUC&dq=athens+magistrate+court&q=logographos#v=snippet&q=logographos&f=false MacDowell, DM., ''The Law in Classical Athens'', Cornell University Press, 1978, p.250.]</ref>\n\n===Shifting balance between assembly and courts===\nAs the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. Starting in 355 BC, political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC, the ''[[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]]'' ('indictment against measures contrary to the laws') was introduced. Under this, anything passed or proposed by the assembly could be put on hold for review before a jury \u2013 which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well.\n\nRemarkably, it seems that blocking and then successfully reviewing a measure was enough to validate it without needing the assembly to vote on it. For example, two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passes, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous. The courts became in effect a kind of upper house.\n\nIn the 5th century, there were no procedural differences between an executive decree and a law. They were both simply passed by the assembly. However, beginning in 403 BC, they were set sharply apart. Henceforth, laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6,000. These were known as the ''nomothetai'' (\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, 'the lawmakers').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.60.]</ref>\n\n===Citizen-initiator===\nThe institutions sketched above \u2013 assembly, officeholders, council, courts \u2013 are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, ''Ho boulomenos'' ('he who wishes', or 'anyone who wishes'). This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public lawsuit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers, or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not voted on before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down; these institutions had, after all, no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. However, any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky. If another citizen initiator chose, a public figure could be called to account for their actions and punished. In situations involving a public figure, the initiator was referred to as a ''kategoros'' ('accuser'), a term also used in cases involving homicide, rather than ''ho diokon'' ('the one who pursues').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v0yJ9fECG88C&dq=cambridge+companion+greek+law&q=who+pursues#v=snippet&q=who%20pursues&f=false Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., ''The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law'' Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 130.]</ref>\n\nPericles, according to Thucydides, characterized the Athenians as being very well-informed on politics: \n<blockquote>We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.<ref>\"Funeral Oration\", Thucydides II.40, trans.

While there seems to have also been a type of citizen assembly (presumably of the [[hoplite]] class), the archons and the body of the Areopagus ran the state and the mass of people had no say in government at all before these reforms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YQaFAgAAQBAJ&dq=thorley+athen+democ&q=%22the+arkhons%2C+with%22#v=snippet&q=%22the%20arkhons%2C%20with%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;8\u20139.]</ref>\n\nSolon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was made up of ex-archons, this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of the nobles there as well. However, even with Solon's creation of the citizen's assembly, the Archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RxH3UcC2FYwC&dq=sinclair+athen+democ&q=%22liberty+of+Athenians%22#v=snippet&q=%22liberty%20of%20Athenians%22&f=false Sinclair, RK., ''Democracy and Participation in Athens'', Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp.&nbsp;1\u20132.]</ref>\n\nThe reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the Assembly, but were still selected from the upper classes.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': archon</ref> The Areopagus kept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', which meant that it could veto actions it deemed unconstitutional, however, this worked in practice.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, p. 55.</ref>\n\nEphialtes, and later [[Pericles]], stripped the Areopagus of its role in supervising and controlling the other institutions, dramatically reducing its power. In the play ''[[The Eumenides]]'', performed in 458, [[Aeschylus]], himself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself, an apparent attempt to preserve the dignity of the Areopagus in the face of its disempowerment.<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 55 56\"/>\n\n===Officeholders===\nApproximately 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held office each year. They were mostly [[sortition|chosen by lot]], with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group of about 100 [[election|elected]]. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals ([[strategoi]]), each office had restrictive term limits. For example, a citizen could only be a member of the Boule in two non-consecutive years in their life.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&source=gbs_navlinks_s Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.29.]</ref> In addition, there were some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement ([[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (''dokimasia'') at which time they might be disqualified.\n\nWhile citizens voting in the assembly were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office ''served'' the people and could be punished very severely. In addition to being subject to review prior to holding office, officeholders were also subject to an examination after leaving office (''euthunai'', 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up the possibility of a contest before a jury court if some citizen wanted to take a matter up.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&source=gbs_navlinks_s Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;42\u201343.]</ref> In the case of scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten \"main meetings\" (''kuriai ekklesiai'') a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly?\n\nCitizens active as officeholders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. By and large, the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. These officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives, so their role was that of administration, rather than governing. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. Part of the ethos of democracy, rather, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century setup, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers.\n\n====Selection by lot====\nThe allotment of an individual was based on citizenship, rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment, therefore, was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens political equality, as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. This also acted as a check against [[demagoguery]], though this check was imperfect and did not prevent elections from involving pandering to voters.<ref>Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;44\u201345.</ref>\n\nThe random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to mitigate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group, one person is more likely to know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office, everyone on the team would be observing everybody else as a sort of check. However, there were officials, such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other.\n\nNo office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians, it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use the office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.<ref>Raaflaub, Kurt A., Ober, Josiah and Wallace Robert W., ''Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 2007 p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Election====\n[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269 n5.jpg|thumb|[[Pericles with the Corinthian helmet|Bust of Pericles]], marble Roman copy after a Greek original from c. 430&nbsp;BC]]\nDuring an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the ''[[strategoi]]''. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case, wealth was virtually a prerequisite.\n\nGenerals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge, but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of [[Pericles]], the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis. Yet in the case of Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His officeholding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy, the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part, this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms of warfare practiced in the later period.\n\nElected officials, too, were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they could also be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. There was even a death penalty for \"inadequate performance\" while in office.<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-43.html|title=Ostracism: selection and de-selection in ancient Greece|last=Cartledge|first=Paul|date=July 2006|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nAthenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Ancient Greek critics of Athenian democracy include [[Thucydides]] the general and historian, [[Aristophanes]] the playwright, [[Plato]] the pupil of Socrates, [[Aristotle]] the pupil of Plato, and a writer known as the [[Old Oligarch]]. While modern critics are more likely to find fault with the restrictive qualifications for political involvement, these ancients viewed democracy as being too inclusive. For them, the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and were likely to make huge mistakes. According to Samons:<blockquote>The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, mistakes, and misdeeds\u2014most infamously, the execution of Socrates\u2014that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhoFUylKLAAC&dq=athens+execute+generals&q=%22modern+desire+to+look+to+Athens%22#v=snippet&q=%22modern%20desire%20to%20look%20to%20Athens%22&f=false Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, p. 6.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThucydides, from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that a serious flaw in democratic government was that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly, in contrast to his own critical-historical approach to history. For example, he points to errors regarding [[Sparta]]; Athenians erroneously believed that Sparta's kings each had two votes in their ruling council and that there existed a Spartan battalion called Pitanate ''lochos''. To Thucydides, this carelessness was due to common peoples' \"preference for ready-made accounts\".<ref>[[Josiah Ober|Ober, J.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iKXXc7AFuakC&dq=athenian+democracy+thucydides+critic&q=%27Pitanate+lochos#v=snippet&q='Pitanate%20lochos&f=false''Political Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule'', Princeton University Press, 2001, pp. 54 & 78\u201379.]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Plato and Aristotle criticized democratic rule as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which everyone has equal rights, they regarded it as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle's works, this is categorized as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality.<ref>[[Donald Kagan|Kagan, D.]], https://books.google.com/books?id=z9garz74CJ0C&dq=athens+kagan&q=%22Plato+and+Aristotle+must%22#v=snippet&q=%22Plato%20and%20Aristotle%20must%22&f=false ''The Fall of the Athenian Empire'', Cornell University Press, 2013, p. 108.]</ref>\n\nTo its ancient detractors, rule by the ''demos'' was also reckless and arbitrary. Two examples demonstrate this:\n*In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at [[Battle of Arginusae|Arginusae]] over the Spartans. After the battle, a storm arose and the [[strategos|generals]] in command failed to collect survivors. The Athenians tried and sentenced six of the eight generals to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. [[Socrates]] happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate (though to little effect) and stood against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. In addition to this unlawful injustice, the ''demos'' later on regretted the decision and decided that they had been misled. Those charged with misleading the ''demos'' were put on trial, including the author of the motion to try the generals together.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lmipXXWdohoC&pg=PA197&dq=athens+execute+generals+Arginusae&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AYDXU9fXDoesPdWIgKAO&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=athens%20execute%20generals%20Arginusae&f=false Hobden, F. and Tuplin, C., ''Xenophon: Ethical Principles and Historical Enquiry'', BRILL, 2012, pp.&nbsp;196\u2013199.]</ref>\n*In 399 BC, [[Socrates]] himself was put on trial and executed for \"corrupting the young and believing in strange gods\". His death gave Europe one of the first intellectual martyrs still recorded, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple and enemy to democracy, [[Plato]]. From Socrates's arguments at his trial, Loren Samons writes, \"It follows, of course, that any majority\u2014including the majority of jurors\u2014is unlikely to choose rightly.\" However, \"some might argue, Athens is the only state that can claim to have produced a Socrates. Surely, some might continue, we may simply write off events such as Socrates' execution as examples of the Athenians' failure to realize fully the meaning and potential of their own democracy.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhoFUylKLAAC&dq=samons+democracy&q=%22only+criticism+of%22#v=snippet&q=%22only%20criticism%20of%22&f=false Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, p. 12 & 195.]</ref>\nWhile Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule of the ''demos'' were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his alternatives to democracy. His ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'', and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour of a much narrower form of government: \"The organization of the city must be confided to those who possess knowledge, who alone can enable their fellow-citizens to attain virtue, and therefore excellence, by means of education.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQfFuJBiWvsC&dq=athens+hansen&q=%22organization+of+the+city+must%22#v=snippet&q=%22organization%20of%20the%20city%20must%22&f=false Beck, H., ''Companion to Ancient Greek Government'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 103.]</ref>\n\nWhether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established in 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms ([[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]] 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For instance, the system of ''nomothesia'' was introduced. In this:\n{{blockquote|A new law might be proposed by any citizen. Any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law. The citizen making the proposal had to publish it [in] advance: publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the Eponymous Heroes in the agora. The proposal would be considered by the Council, and would be placed on the agenda of the Assembly in the form of a motion. If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed change, the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai (literally \"establishers of the law\").<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\" />}}\nIncreasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside to this change was that the new democracy was less capable of responding quickly in times where quick, decisive action was needed.\n\nAnother tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least, democracy fed off an empire of subject states. [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC.\n\nAt times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of [[Melos]] and sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Furthermore, they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the [[Old Oligarch]]. This writer (also called pseudo-Xenophon) produced several comments critical of democracy, such as:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKXXc7AFuakC&dq=athenian+democracy+thucydides+critic&q=%22democracy%E2%80%99s+domestic+and+foreign%22#v=snippet&q=%22democracy%E2%80%99s%20domestic%20and%20foreign%22&f=false Ober, J., ''Political Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule'', Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 43.]</ref>\n# Democratic rule acts in the benefit of smaller self-interested factions, rather than the entire polis.\n# Collectivizing political responsibility lends itself to both dishonest practices and scapegoating individuals when measures become unpopular. \n# By being inclusive, opponents to the system become naturally included within the democratic framework, meaning democracy itself will generate few opponents, despite its flaws.\n# A democratic Athens with an imperial policy will spread the desire for democracy outside of the polis.\n# The democratic government depends on the control of resources, which requires military power and material exploitation.\n# The values of freedom of equality include non-citizens more than it should.\n# By blurring the distinction between the natural and political world, democracy leads the powerful to act immorally and outside their own best interest.\n\nAristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy.

By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.\n*Originally, a male would be a citizen if his father was a citizen, Under [[Pericles]], in 450 BC, restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born to an Athenian father and an Athenian mother. So ''Metroxenoi'', those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. These mixed marriages were also heavily penalized by the time of Demosthenes. Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship had this law applied to them: [[Cleisthenes]], the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] were not Greek at all, but [[Thrace|Thracian]].<ref name=\"Hansen 1991 53\">[https://archive.org/details/atheniandemocrac00hans <!-- quote=offspring from slave women. --> Hansen, MH., ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes: Structure, Principles, and Ideology'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1991, p.53.]</ref>\n*Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. In Sparta, women competed in public exercise \u2013 so in [[Aristophanes]]'s ''Lysistrata'' the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Spartan counterparts \u2013 and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. [[Misogyny]] was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that Athens had worse misogyny than other states at the time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-U6IAgAAQBAJ&dq=athens+democracy+++worse+women&q=worse+in+athens#v=snippet&q=worse%20in%20athens&f=false Just, R., ''Women in Athenian Law and Life'', Routledge, 2008, p. 15.]</ref>\n*[[Slavery in antiquity|Slavery]] was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed, the extensive use of imported non-Greeks (\"[[barbarian]]s\") as [[chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the paradoxical question: Was democracy \"based on\" slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians \u2014 owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth \u2014 to devote more of their time to political life.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&pg=PA313&dq=athens+democracy+++++slavery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qBrVU6f2Nazb7Aar5YGQDQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=athens%20democracy%20%20%20%20%20slavery&f=false Rodriguez, JP., ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery'', Volume 7, ABC-CLIO, 1997, pp.&nbsp;312\u2013314.]</ref> But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). Allowing a new kind of equality among citizens opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics, all these connections remain speculative. However, as [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] pointed out, other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery, it is speculated that Athenian fathers had originally been able to register offspring conceived with slave women for citizenship.<ref name=\"Hansen 1991 53\"/>\n\nSince the 19th century, the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one group as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want [[representative democracy]] to be added to or even replaced by [[direct democracy]] in the Athenian way, perhaps by utilizing [[electronic democracy]]. Another group, on the other hand, considers that, since many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government, Athenian democracy was not a democracy at all. \"[C]omparisons with Athens will continue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy under modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&dq=athenian+democracy+modern+view&q=%22overlooking+the+fact+that%22#v=snippet&q=%22overlooking%20the%20fact%20that%22&f=false Grafton, A., Most, GA. and Settis, S., ''The Classical Tradition'', Harvard University Press, 2010, p.259.]</ref>\n\nGreek philosopher and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] has argued that \u201cthe final failure, of Athenian democracy was not due, as it is usually asserted by its critics, to the innate contradictions of democracy itself but, on the contrary, to the fact that the Athenian democracy never matured to become an [[inclusive democracy]]. This cannot be adequately explained by simply referring to the immature \u2018objective\u2019 conditions, the low development of productive forces and so on\u2014important as may be\u2014because the same objective conditions prevailed at that time in many other places all over the Mediterranean, let alone the rest of Greece, but democracy flourished only in Athens\u201d .<ref>[https://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Fotopoulos Takis, ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'', Cassell/Continuum, 1997, p.194\"]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, most countries have claimed to be a democracy, regardless of the actual makeup of its government. Yet, after the demise of Athenian democracy, few looked upon it as a good form of government. This was because no legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the negative accounts of Plato and Aristotle. They saw it as the rule of the poor that plundered the rich, and so democracy was viewed as a sort of \"collective tyranny\". \"Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned.\" Sometimes, mixed constitutions evolved with a democratic element, but \"it definitely did not mean self-rule by citizens.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&dq=athenian+democracy+modern+view&q=%22overlooking+the+fact+that%22#v=snippet&q=%22overlooking%20the%20fact%20that%22&f=false Grafton, A., Most, GA. and Settis, S., ''The Classical Tradition'', Harvard University Press, 2010, pp.&nbsp;256\u2013259.]</ref>\n\nIn the age of [[Cicero]] and [[Caesar]], Rome was a republic, but not a democracy. Furthermore, it would be misleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important part of the 18th-century revolutionaries' intellectual background. The classical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries, as well as the English radicals, was Rome rather than Greece. Thus, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] who met in Philadelphia in 1787, did not set up a Council of the Areopagos, but a [[Senate]], that, eventually, met on the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8lPaSAnZg28C&dq=athenian+democracy+romanrepublic&q=%22it+would+be+misleading+%22#v=snippet&q=%22it%20would%20be%20misleading%20%22&f=false Hansen, MH., ''The Tradition of Ancient Greek Democracy and Its Importance for Modern Democracy'', Kgl.

In opposition, thinkers such as [[Samuel Johnson]] were worried about the ignorance of a democratic decision-making body. However, \"[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[George Grote]] saw the great strength of the Athenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed and called for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make possible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient Athenians.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OhhSc1ds4QC&pg=PA96&dq=grote++athenian+democracy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=t67cU7KEJ4ig7AbG4oCQCA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=grote%20%20athenian%20democracy&f=false Roberts, J., in Euben, JP et al., ''Athenian Political Thought and the Reconstruction of American Democracy', Cornell University Press, 1994, p. 96.]</ref>\n\nTherefore, it was George Grote, in his ''History of Greece'' (1846\u20131856), who would claim that \"Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor, nor the rule of the mob.\" He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote would people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest. Later, to the end of World War Il, democracy became dissociated from its ancient frame of reference.

Other Greek cities set up democracies, most following the Athenian model, but none are as well documented as Athens'.\n\nAthens practiced a [[political system]] of [[legislation]] and executive bills. Participation was not open to all residents, but was instead limited to adult, male citizens (i.e., not a [[metic|foreign resident]], a [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slave]], or a woman), who \"were probably no more than 30 percent of the total adult population\".<ref name=\"p. 74\">{{cite book|last=Thorley |first=John |title=Athenian Democracy |series=Lancaster Pamphlets in Ancient History |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 |page=74 |isbn=978-1-13-479335-8}}</ref>\n\n[[Solon]] (in 594 BC), [[Cleisthenes]] (in 508/7 BC), and [[Ephialtes]] (in 462 BC) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived, rather than on their wealth. The longest-lasting democratic leader was [[Pericles]]. After his death, Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by [[oligarchic]] revolutions towards the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]]. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under [[Eucleides]]; the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourth-century modification, rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]] in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived, but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Democracy}}\nThe word \"democracy\" (Greek: \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1) combines the elements ''d\u00eamos'' (\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"people\") and ''kr\u00e1tos'' (\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"force\" or \"power\"), and thus means literally \"people power\". In the words \"monarchy\" and \"oligarchy\", the second element comes from ''arch\u0113'' (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae), meaning \"beginning (that which comes first)\", and hence also \"first place or power\", \"sovereignty\". One might expect the term \"demarchy\" to have been adopted, by analogy, for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However, the word \"demarchy\" (\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) had already been taken and meant \"[[mayoralty]]\", the office or rank of a high [[municipal]] [[magistrate]]. (In present-day use, the term \"[[demarchy]]\" has acquired a new meaning.)\n\nIt is unknown whether the word \"democracy\" was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470BC with Aeschylus' [[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|The Suppliants]] (l. 604) with the line sung by the Chorus: \u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1. This approximately translates as the \"people's hand of power\" and in the context of the play acts as a counterpoint to the inclination of the votes cast by the people, i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has power. The word is then completely attested in the works of [[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 6.43.3) in both a verbal passive and nominal sense with the terms \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 and  \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, who wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose, but this might not have been before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrates,<ref>Raaflaub, Kurt A. (2007): ''The Breakthrough of Demokratia in Mid-Fifth-Century Athens'', p. 112, in: {{cite book |editor1=Raaflaub, Kurt A. |editor2=Ober, Josiah |editor3=Wallace, Robert |title=Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece |year=2007 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley}}</ref> a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty; the name can also be found in [[Aeolis|Aeolian]] [[Temnus]].<ref>[[Xenophon]], ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' 4.4.15.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Development ===\n{{mainarticle|Athenian Revolution}}\nAthens was never the only [[polis]] in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic regime. [[Aristotle]] points to other cities that adopted governments in the democratic style. However, accounts of the rise of democratic institutions are in reference to Athens, since only this city-state had sufficient historical records to speculate on the rise and nature of Greek democracy.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qry16UDq83EC Clarke, PB. and Foweraker, ''Encyclopedia of Democratic Thought''.

The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] replaced the prevailing system of [[oral law]] by a written [[Code (law)|code]] to be enforced only by a [[court of law]].<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 10\">Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, p.10.</ref> <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp04AAAAIAAJ Farrar, C., ''The Origins of Democratic Thinking: The Invention of Politics in Classical Athens'', CUP Archive, 25 Aug 1989, p.7.]</ref> In 594 BC, [[Solon]], premier archon at the time, issued reforms that defined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function: Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property, Solon reshaped the social framework of the city-state. Under these reforms, a council of 400 members (with 100 citizens from each of Athens's four tribes) called the ''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]'' ran daily affairs and set the political agenda.<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 10\"/> The Areopagus, which formerly took on this role, remained but subsequently carried on the role of \"guardianship of the laws\".<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', Areopagus.</ref> Another major contribution to democracy was Solon's setting up of an ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]]'' or Assembly, which was open to all the male citizens.\n\n[[File:Cleisthenes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleisthenes]]]]\nIn 561 BC, the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant [[Peisistratos]] but was reinstated after the expulsion of his son, [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]], in 510. [[Cleisthenes]] issued reforms in 508 and 507 BC that undermined the domination of the aristocratic families and connected every Athenian to the city's rule.

While Ephialtes's opponents were away attempting to assist the Spartans, he persuaded the Assembly to reduce the powers of the Areopagus to a criminal court for cases of homicide and sacrilege. At the same time or soon afterward, the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship.<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 55 56\">Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;55\u201356</ref>\n\nIn the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in the [[Sicilian expedition|Sicilian campaign]] in 413 BC, a group of citizens took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts, initially conducted through constitutional channels, culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy, the Council of 400, in the [[Athenian coup of 411 BC]]. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by a more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BC, when the government was placed in the hands of the so-called [[Thirty Tyrants]], who were pro-Spartan oligarchs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blackwell|first1=Christopher|title=The Development of Athenian Democracy|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_democracy_development?page=all|website=D\u0113mos: Classical Athenian Democracy|publisher=Stoa|accessdate=4 May 2016}}</ref> After a year pro-democracy elements regained control, and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BC.<ref name=\"pbs An Empire of the Mind\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/48.html |title = The Final End of Athenian Democracy}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] had led a coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC, but his Greek soldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies.

However, the governors, like [[Demetrius of Phalerum]], appointed by [[Cassander]], kept some of the traditional institutions in formal existence, although the Athenian public would consider them to be nothing more than Macedonian puppet dictators.

From a modern perspective these figures may seem small, but among Greek city-states Athens was huge: most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000\u20131500 adult male citizens each; and [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], a major power, had at most 15,000.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hN7pAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44&dq=corinth+population&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HPvXU62wI4TeOp-ogfgO&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=corinth%20population&f=false Dixon, MD., ''Late Classical and Early Hellenistic Corinth: 338\u2013196 BC'', Routledge, 2014, p. 44.]</ref>\n\nThe non-citizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners ([[metic]]s) and slaves, with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator [[Hyperides]] (fragment 13) claimed that there were 150,000 slaves in Attica, but this figure is probably no more than an impression: slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=calr-oiSrTEC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=hyperides+fragment+13+attica+slaves+150,000&source=bl&ots=DMiYE61pBU&sig=y_kT7I9-R7Gndh1Mp_rUcX9Xi4Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e5WAUsztNOTG7AbqxYHgDQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=hyperides%20fragment%2013%20attica%20slaves%20150%2C000&f=false Kamen, D., ''Status in Classical Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2013 p. 9.]</ref>\n\n===Citizenship in Athens===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[State]] -->\nOnly adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as [[Ephebos|ephebe]]s had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10% to 20% of the total number of inhabitants, but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\"/> This excluded a majority of the population: [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]], freed slaves, children, women and [[metic]]s (foreigners\nresident in Athens).<ref>[http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/slaves_and_resident_aliens.html agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised II \u2013 Slaves and Resident Aliens]</ref> The women had limited rights and privileges, had restricted movement in public, and were very segregated from the men.<ref>[http://www.agathe.gr/democracy/women.html agathe.gr: The Unenfranchised I \u2013 Women]</ref>\n\nAlso excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension (typically for failure to pay a debt to the city: see [[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]); for some Athenians, this amounted to permanent (and in fact inheritable) disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of citizenship held by Greek [[city-states]], a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it, compared to oligarchies and aristocracies.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\" />\n\nSome Athenian citizens were far more active than others, but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any present-day democracy.<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\"/> Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens; after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC, only those descended from two Athenian parents could claim citizenship.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, p.59.</ref> Although the legislation was not retrospective, five years later, when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king to be distributed among all citizens, many \"illegitimate\" citizens were removed from the registers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v0yJ9fECG88C&pg=PA278&dq=plutarch+pericles+grain+egypt&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z8rUU8KLC4rb7AaOo4GwCg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=plutarch%20pericles%20grain%20egypt&f=false  Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., ''The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law'' Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 278.]</ref>\n\nCitizenship applied to both individuals and their descendants. It could also be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups (e.g. [[Platea]]ns in 427 BC and [[Samians]] in 405 BC). However, by the 4th century, citizenship was given only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century, the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousands.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RxH3UcC2FYwC&dq=athens+citizenship+grant&q=%22citizenship+was+not%22#v=snippet&q=%22citizenship%20was%20not%22&f=false Sinclair, RK.,''Democracy and Participation in Athens'', Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp.&nbsp;25\u201326.]</ref>\n\n==Main bodies of government==\n[[File:Constitution-of-the-Athenians-in-the-4th-century-BC.png|thumb|center|900px|Constitution of the Athenians, 4th century BC]]There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly (in some cases with a quorum of 6000), the council of 500 (''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boule]]''), and the courts (a minimum of 200 people, on some occasions up to 6,000). Of these three bodies, the assembly and the courts were the true sites of power \u2013 although courts, unlike the assembly, were never simply called the ''demos'' ('the people'), as they were manned by just those citizens over thirty. Crucially, citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution, as were council members and all other officeholders.\n\nIn the 5th century BC, there is often a record of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6,000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid-4th century, however, the assembly's judicial functions were largely curtailed, though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial.\n\n===Ecclesia===\n{{Main|Ecclesia (ancient Athens)}}\nThe central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly]] ({{lang|grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}, ''ekkles\u00eda''). Unlike a [[parliament]], the assembly's members were not elected, but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was [[direct democracy|direct]], rather than [[representative democracy|representative]]: any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.32.]</ref> and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called [[sortition]].\n\nThe assembly had four main functions: it made executive pronouncements (decrees, such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner), elected some officials, legislated, and tried political crimes. As the system evolved, the last function was shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position, followed by a general vote (usually by show of hands) of yes or no.\n\nThough there might be blocs of opinion, sometimes enduring, on important matters, there were no political parties and likewise no [[Forms of government|government]] or [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] (as in the [[Westminster system]]). Voting was by simple [[majority rule|majority]]. In the 5th century at least, there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law, the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made, from the assembly's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.57.]</ref>\n\nAs usual in ancient democracies, one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands (\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, ''kheirotonia'', 'arm stretching') with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could cause problems when it became too dark to see properly. However, any member could demand that officials issue a recount.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p&nbsp;33\u201334.]</ref> For a small category of votes, a quorum of 6,000 was required, principally grants of citizenship, and here small coloured stones were used, white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session, each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. [[Ostracism]] required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery (\u1f44\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1, ''ostraka''), though this did not occur within the assembly as such.\n[[File:Pnyx-berg2.png|thumb|250px|The [[Pnyx]] with the speaker's platform, the meeting place of the people of Athens.]]\n\nIn the 5th century BC, there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year, one in each of the ten [[Attic calendar#State calendar|state months]], with other meetings called as needed. In the following century, the meetings were set to forty a year, with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting, ''kyria ekklesia''. Additional meetings might still be called, especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly, rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals, as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RBcABAAAQBAJ&dq=athens+assembly+frequency&q=%22assembly+normally%22#v=snippet&q=%22assembly%20normally%22&f=false Manville, PB., ''The Origins of Citizenship in Ancient Athens'', Princeton University Press, 2014 p. 182.]</ref>\n\nAttendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century, public slaves forming a cordon with a red-stained rope herded citizens from the [[agora]] into the assembly meeting place ([[Pnyx]]), with a fine being imposed on those who got the red on their clothes.<ref>[[Aristophanes]] ''Acharnians'' 17\u201322.</ref> After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC, pay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6,000 to arrive were admitted and paid, with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay.<ref>Aristoph. ''Ekklesiazousai'' 378-9</ref>\n\n===The Boule===\n{{Main|Boule (ancient Greece)#The Athenian Boule}}\nIn 594 BC, Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of the assembly.<ref>Terry Buckley, Aspects of Greek History: ''A Source-Based Approach'', Routledge, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pxqIAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 p. 98].</ref> After the reforms of Cleisthenes, the Athenian Boule was expanded to 500 and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleisthenes's 10 tribes provided 50 councilors who were at least 30 years old. The Boule's roles in public affairs included finance, maintaining the military's cavalry and fleet of ships, advising the [[Strategos|generals]], approving of newly elected magistrates, and receiving ambassadors. Most importantly, the Boule would draft ''probouleumata'', or deliberations for the Ecclesia to discuss and approve on. During emergencies, the Ecclesia would also grant special temporary powers to the Boule.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': boule.</ref></blockquote>\n\nCleisthenes restricted the Boule's membership to those of [[zeugitai]] status (and above), presumably because these classes' financial interests gave them an incentive towards effective governance. A member had to be approved by his deme, each of which would have an incentive to select those with experience in local politics and the greatest likelihood at effective participation in government.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&q=%22those+of+zeugitai+status%22#v=snippet&q=%22those%20of%20zeugitai%20status%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;31\u201332]</ref>\n\nThe members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act as a standing committee (the ''[[prytaneis]]'') of the Boule for a period of thirty-six days. All fifty members of the prytaneis on duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the ''[[Prytaneion#Tholos, Athens|Prytaneion]]'', a building adjacent to the ''[[bouleuterion]]'', where the boule met. A chairman for each tribe was chosen by lot each day, who was required to stay in the tholos for the next 24 hours, presiding over meetings of the Boule and Assembly.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&q=%22those+of+zeugitai+status%22#v=snippet&q=%22those%20of%20zeugitai%20status%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;30\u201331.]</ref>\n\nThe boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly, and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances.<ref>Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 238</ref> Altogether, the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state, but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative; the boule's control over policy was executed in its probouleutic, rather than its executive function; in the former, it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly, in the latter, it merely executed the wishes of the assembly.<ref>Hignett, ''History of the Athenian Constitution'', 241</ref>\n\n===Courts===\nAthens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights (see ''[[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]''). The age limit of 30 or older, the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly, gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly. Jurors were required to be under oath, which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly: both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders (magistrates), who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct, the jurors could not be censured, for they, in effect, were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that, at least acclaimed by defendants, if a court had made an unjust decision, it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=XvyoMAUCTh8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Dover, KJ., ''Greek Popular Morality in the Time of Plato and Aristotle'', Hackett Publishing, 1994, p.23.]</ref>\n\nEssentially there were two grades of a suit, a smaller kind known as ''dike'' (\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7) or private suit, and a larger kind known as ''graphe'' or public suit. For private suits, the minimum jury size was 200 (increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue), for public suits 501. Under Cleisthenes's reforms, juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors, there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens, making a jury pool of 6000 in total.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, pp.&nbsp;36\u201338.</ref> For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion, the first time a new kind of case was brought to court (see ''[[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]]''), all 6,000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=92_Nz8jjrSUC&pg=PA36&dq=athens+court+jury+6000&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vPHUU8nZFaSV7Ab8qYCoCw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%206000&f=false MacDowell, DM., ''The Law in Classical Athens'', Cornell University Press, 1978, p.36.]</ref>\n[[File:Water Clock in Ancient Agora of Athens.jpg|thumb|Water Clock in the Ancient Agora of Athens.]]\nThe cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by a [[water clock]] or ''clepsydra'', first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak, much less in private suits (though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake). Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy, shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a 'yes' or 'no' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute, while for public suits anyone (''ho boulomenos'', 'whoever wants to' i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights) could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole.\n\nJustice was rapid: a case could last no longer than one day and had to be completed by the time the sun set.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8D_--jaxt3EC&pg=PA1013&dq=athens+court+jury+%22one+day%22+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J_jUU77MOonB7AbrsIHYAw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%20%22one%20day%22%20-georgia%20-ohio&f=false Bertoch, MJ., The Greeks had a jury for it, ''ABA Journal'', October, 1971, Vol. 57, p.1013.]</ref> Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty, but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCbeFkmvXB0C&pg=PA167&dq=athens+court+jury+penalty+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3_nUU5cfobDsBqbFgZAJ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=athens%20court%20jury%20penalty%20-georgia%20-ohio&f=false Arnason, JP., Raaflaub, KA. and Wagner, P., ''The Greek Polis and the Invention of Democracy: A Politico-cultural Transformation and Its Interpretations'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013' p. 167.]</ref> No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor, which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict.\n\nPayment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to [[Pericles]], a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy (''Politics'' 1294a37). Pay was raised from 2 to 3 [[obol (coin)|obol]]s by [[Cleon]] early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed; the original amount is not known. Notably, this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts, at least for private suits, had to be suspended.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fkjzwJxCA4C&pg=PA235&dq=athens+court+jury+financial+crisis+-georgia+-ohio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hPbUU_TJCumr7AaJ74HQDQ&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=suspension&f=false Rhodes, PJ., ''A History of the Classical Greek World: 478 \u2013 323 BC'', John Wiley & Sons, 2011, p. 235.]</ref>\n\nThe system showed a marked anti-professionalism. No judges presided over the courts, nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors. Magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies in Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself; it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter or [[Logographer (legal)|logographer]] (''logographos''), but this may not have been advertised in court. Jurors would likely be more impressed if it seemed as though litigants were speaking for themselves.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=92_Nz8jjrSUC&dq=athens+magistrate+court&q=logographos#v=snippet&q=logographos&f=false MacDowell, DM., ''The Law in Classical Athens'', Cornell University Press, 1978, p.250.]</ref>\n\n===Shifting balance between assembly and courts===\nAs the system evolved, the courts (that is, citizens under another guise) intruded upon the power of the assembly. Starting in 355 BC, political trials were no longer held in the assembly, but only in a court. In 416 BC, the ''[[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]]'' ('indictment against measures contrary to the laws') was introduced. Under this, anything passed or proposed by the assembly could be put on hold for review before a jury \u2013 which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well.\n\nRemarkably, it seems that blocking and then successfully reviewing a measure was enough to validate it without needing the assembly to vote on it. For example, two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them; it passes, and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous. The courts became in effect a kind of upper house.\n\nIn the 5th century, there were no procedural differences between an executive decree and a law. They were both simply passed by the assembly. However, beginning in 403 BC, they were set sharply apart. Henceforth, laws were made not in the assembly, but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6,000. These were known as the ''nomothetai'' (\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b8\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, 'the lawmakers').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ibLUU9W4J6yw7Ab_-oHADw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&q=between%2030%2C000&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.60.]</ref>\n\n===Citizen-initiator===\nThe institutions sketched above \u2013 assembly, officeholders, council, courts \u2013 are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system, ''Ho boulomenos'' ('he who wishes', or 'anyone who wishes'). This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative to stand to speak in the assembly, to initiate a public lawsuit (that is, one held to affect the political community as a whole), to propose a law before the lawmakers, or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders, the citizen initiator was not voted on before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down; these institutions had, after all, no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. However, any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky. If another citizen initiator chose, a public figure could be called to account for their actions and punished. In situations involving a public figure, the initiator was referred to as a ''kategoros'' ('accuser'), a term also used in cases involving homicide, rather than ''ho diokon'' ('the one who pursues').<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v0yJ9fECG88C&dq=cambridge+companion+greek+law&q=who+pursues#v=snippet&q=who%20pursues&f=false Cohen D. and Gagarin, M., ''The Cambridge Companion to Ancient Greek Law'' Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 130.]</ref>\n\nPericles, according to Thucydides, characterized the Athenians as being very well-informed on politics: \n<blockquote>We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business; we say that he has no business here at all.<ref>\"Funeral Oration\", Thucydides II.40, trans.

While there seems to have also been a type of citizen assembly (presumably of the [[hoplite]] class), the archons and the body of the Areopagus ran the state and the mass of people had no say in government at all before these reforms.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YQaFAgAAQBAJ&dq=thorley+athen+democ&q=%22the+arkhons%2C+with%22#v=snippet&q=%22the%20arkhons%2C%20with%22&f=false Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;8\u20139.]</ref>\n\nSolon's reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was made up of ex-archons, this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of the nobles there as well. However, even with Solon's creation of the citizen's assembly, the Archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RxH3UcC2FYwC&dq=sinclair+athen+democ&q=%22liberty+of+Athenians%22#v=snippet&q=%22liberty%20of%20Athenians%22&f=false Sinclair, RK., ''Democracy and Participation in Athens'', Cambridge University Press, 30 Aug 1991, pp.&nbsp;1\u20132.]</ref>\n\nThe reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the Assembly, but were still selected from the upper classes.<ref>''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': archon</ref> The Areopagus kept its power as 'Guardian of the Laws', which meant that it could veto actions it deemed unconstitutional, however, this worked in practice.<ref>Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005, p. 55.</ref>\n\nEphialtes, and later [[Pericles]], stripped the Areopagus of its role in supervising and controlling the other institutions, dramatically reducing its power. In the play ''[[The Eumenides]]'', performed in 458, [[Aeschylus]], himself a noble, portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself, an apparent attempt to preserve the dignity of the Areopagus in the face of its disempowerment.<ref name=\"Thorley 2005 55 56\"/>\n\n===Officeholders===\nApproximately 1100 citizens (including the members of the council of 500) held office each year. They were mostly [[sortition|chosen by lot]], with a much smaller (and more prestigious) group of about 100 [[election|elected]]. Neither was compulsory; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular, those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since, with the notable exception of the generals ([[strategoi]]), each office had restrictive term limits. For example, a citizen could only be a member of the Boule in two non-consecutive years in their life.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&source=gbs_navlinks_s Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  p.29.]</ref> In addition, there were some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum, rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement ([[Atimia (loss of citizen rights)|atimia]]), excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily (depending on the type). Furthermore, all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office (''dokimasia'') at which time they might be disqualified.\n\nWhile citizens voting in the assembly were free of review or punishment, those same citizens when holding an office ''served'' the people and could be punished very severely. In addition to being subject to review prior to holding office, officeholders were also subject to an examination after leaving office (''euthunai'', 'straightenings' or 'submission of accounts') to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic, but they opened up the possibility of a contest before a jury court if some citizen wanted to take a matter up.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iU6EAgAAQBAJ&dq=athenian+democracy+thorley&source=gbs_navlinks_s Thorley, J., ''Athenian Democracy'', Routledge, 2005,  pp.&nbsp;42\u201343.]</ref> In the case of scrutiny going to trial, there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Even during his period of office, any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten \"main meetings\" (''kuriai ekklesiai'') a year, the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda: were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly?\n\nCitizens active as officeholders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. By and large, the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. These officeholders were the agents of the people, not their representatives, so their role was that of administration, rather than governing. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. When it came to penal sanctions, no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue, but rather, at least in the 4th century BC, whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. Part of the ethos of democracy, rather, was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century setup, the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent, but for those who had power, it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly, rather than their vested powers.\n\n====Selection by lot====\nThe allotment of an individual was based on citizenship, rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment, therefore, was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens political equality, as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. This also acted as a check against [[demagoguery]], though this check was imperfect and did not prevent elections from involving pandering to voters.<ref>Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;44\u201345.</ref>\n\nThe random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks, but the system included features meant to mitigate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams (boards, panels). In a group, one person is more likely to know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office, everyone on the team would be observing everybody else as a sort of check. However, there were officials, such as the nine archons, who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other.\n\nNo office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case, simply by demographic necessity, an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians, it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use the office as a way of accumulating ongoing power.<ref>Raaflaub, Kurt A., Ober, Josiah and Wallace Robert W., ''Origins of Democracy in Ancient Greece'', University of California Press, 2007 p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Election====\n[[File:Pericles Pio-Clementino Inv269 n5.jpg|thumb|[[Pericles with the Corinthian helmet|Bust of Pericles]], marble Roman copy after a Greek original from c. 430&nbsp;BC]]\nDuring an Athenian election, approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group: those required to handle large sums of money, and the 10 generals, the ''[[strategoi]]''. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] could be recovered from their estates; election in general strongly favoured the rich, but in this case, wealth was virtually a prerequisite.\n\nGenerals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge, but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC, principally as seen through the figure of [[Pericles]], the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis. Yet in the case of Pericles, it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships (each year along with nine others). His officeholding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly, a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy, the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part, this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms of warfare practiced in the later period.\n\nElected officials, too, were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they could also be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. There was even a death penalty for \"inadequate performance\" while in office.<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-43.html|title=Ostracism: selection and de-selection in ancient Greece|last=Cartledge|first=Paul|date=July 2006|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nAthenian democracy has had many critics, both ancient and modern. Ancient Greek critics of Athenian democracy include [[Thucydides]] the general and historian, [[Aristophanes]] the playwright, [[Plato]] the pupil of Socrates, [[Aristotle]] the pupil of Plato, and a writer known as the [[Old Oligarch]]. While modern critics are more likely to find fault with the restrictive qualifications for political involvement, these ancients viewed democracy as being too inclusive. For them, the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and were likely to make huge mistakes. According to Samons:<blockquote>The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, mistakes, and misdeeds\u2014most infamously, the execution of Socrates\u2014that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhoFUylKLAAC&dq=athens+execute+generals&q=%22modern+desire+to+look+to+Athens%22#v=snippet&q=%22modern%20desire%20to%20look%20to%20Athens%22&f=false Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, p. 6.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThucydides, from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint, reasoned that a serious flaw in democratic government was that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly, in contrast to his own critical-historical approach to history. For example, he points to errors regarding [[Sparta]]; Athenians erroneously believed that Sparta's kings each had two votes in their ruling council and that there existed a Spartan battalion called Pitanate ''lochos''. To Thucydides, this carelessness was due to common peoples' \"preference for ready-made accounts\".<ref>[[Josiah Ober|Ober, J.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=iKXXc7AFuakC&dq=athenian+democracy+thucydides+critic&q=%27Pitanate+lochos#v=snippet&q='Pitanate%20lochos&f=false''Political Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule'', Princeton University Press, 2001, pp. 54 & 78\u201379.]</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Plato and Aristotle criticized democratic rule as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which everyone has equal rights, they regarded it as manifestly unjust. In Aristotle's works, this is categorized as the difference between 'arithmetic' and 'geometric' (i.e. proportional) equality.<ref>[[Donald Kagan|Kagan, D.]], https://books.google.com/books?id=z9garz74CJ0C&dq=athens+kagan&q=%22Plato+and+Aristotle+must%22#v=snippet&q=%22Plato%20and%20Aristotle%20must%22&f=false ''The Fall of the Athenian Empire'', Cornell University Press, 2013, p. 108.]</ref>\n\nTo its ancient detractors, rule by the ''demos'' was also reckless and arbitrary. Two examples demonstrate this:\n*In 406 BC, after years of defeats in the wake of the annihilation of their vast invasion force in Sicily, the Athenians at last won a naval victory at [[Battle of Arginusae|Arginusae]] over the Spartans. After the battle, a storm arose and the [[strategos|generals]] in command failed to collect survivors. The Athenians tried and sentenced six of the eight generals to death. Technically, it was illegal, as the generals were tried and sentenced together, rather than one by one as Athenian law required. [[Socrates]] happened to be the citizen presiding over the assembly that day and refused to cooperate (though to little effect) and stood against the idea that it was outrageous for the people to be unable to do whatever they wanted. In addition to this unlawful injustice, the ''demos'' later on regretted the decision and decided that they had been misled. Those charged with misleading the ''demos'' were put on trial, including the author of the motion to try the generals together.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lmipXXWdohoC&pg=PA197&dq=athens+execute+generals+Arginusae&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AYDXU9fXDoesPdWIgKAO&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=athens%20execute%20generals%20Arginusae&f=false Hobden, F. and Tuplin, C., ''Xenophon: Ethical Principles and Historical Enquiry'', BRILL, 2012, pp.&nbsp;196\u2013199.]</ref>\n*In 399 BC, [[Socrates]] himself was put on trial and executed for \"corrupting the young and believing in strange gods\". His death gave Europe one of the first intellectual martyrs still recorded, but guaranteed the democracy an eternity of bad press at the hands of his disciple and enemy to democracy, [[Plato]]. From Socrates's arguments at his trial, Loren Samons writes, \"It follows, of course, that any majority\u2014including the majority of jurors\u2014is unlikely to choose rightly.\" However, \"some might argue, Athens is the only state that can claim to have produced a Socrates. Surely, some might continue, we may simply write off events such as Socrates' execution as examples of the Athenians' failure to realize fully the meaning and potential of their own democracy.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HhoFUylKLAAC&dq=samons+democracy&q=%22only+criticism+of%22#v=snippet&q=%22only%20criticism%20of%22&f=false Samons, L., ''What's Wrong with Democracy?: From Athenian Practice to American Worship'', University of California Press, 2004, p. 12 & 195.]</ref>\nWhile Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates, his criticisms of the rule of the ''demos'' were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his alternatives to democracy. His ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'', and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour of a much narrower form of government: \"The organization of the city must be confided to those who possess knowledge, who alone can enable their fellow-citizens to attain virtue, and therefore excellence, by means of education.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQfFuJBiWvsC&dq=athens+hansen&q=%22organization+of+the+city+must%22#v=snippet&q=%22organization%20of%20the%20city%20must%22&f=false Beck, H., ''Companion to Ancient Greek Government'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 103.]</ref>\n\nWhether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic, or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war, there does seem to have been a move toward correction. A new version of democracy was established in 403 BC, but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms ([[graph\u0113 paran\u00f3m\u014dn]] 416 BC; end of assembly trials 355 BC). For instance, the system of ''nomothesia'' was introduced. In this:\n{{blockquote|A new law might be proposed by any citizen. Any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law. The citizen making the proposal had to publish it [in] advance: publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the Eponymous Heroes in the agora. The proposal would be considered by the Council, and would be placed on the agenda of the Assembly in the form of a motion. If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed change, the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai (literally \"establishers of the law\").<ref name=\"homepages.gac.edu\" />}}\nIncreasingly, responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts, with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say, the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath, and with more time to focus on just one matter (though never more than a day). One downside to this change was that the new democracy was less capable of responding quickly in times where quick, decisive action was needed.\n\nAnother tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years, they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least, democracy fed off an empire of subject states. [[Thucydides (politician)|Thucydides]] the son of Milesias (not the historian), an aristocrat, stood in opposition to these policies, for which he was ostracised in 443 BC.\n\nAt times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality, as in the decision to execute the entire male population of [[Melos]] and sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy, which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Furthermore, they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the [[Old Oligarch]]. This writer (also called pseudo-Xenophon) produced several comments critical of democracy, such as:<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=iKXXc7AFuakC&dq=athenian+democracy+thucydides+critic&q=%22democracy%E2%80%99s+domestic+and+foreign%22#v=snippet&q=%22democracy%E2%80%99s%20domestic%20and%20foreign%22&f=false Ober, J., ''Political Dissent in Democratic Athens: Intellectual Critics of Popular Rule'', Princeton University Press, 2001, p. 43.]</ref>\n# Democratic rule acts in the benefit of smaller self-interested factions, rather than the entire polis.\n# Collectivizing political responsibility lends itself to both dishonest practices and scapegoating individuals when measures become unpopular. \n# By being inclusive, opponents to the system become naturally included within the democratic framework, meaning democracy itself will generate few opponents, despite its flaws.\n# A democratic Athens with an imperial policy will spread the desire for democracy outside of the polis.\n# The democratic government depends on the control of resources, which requires military power and material exploitation.\n# The values of freedom of equality include non-citizens more than it should.\n# By blurring the distinction between the natural and political world, democracy leads the powerful to act immorally and outside their own best interest.\n\nAristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy. Rather than any citizen partaking with an equal share in the rule, he thought that those who were more virtuous should have greater power in governance.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZQfFuJBiWvsC&dq=athens+hansen&q=%22the+chief+determinant+%22#v=snippet&q=%22the%20chief%20determinant%20%22&f=false Beck, H., ''Companion to Ancient Greek Government'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p.107.]</ref>\n\nA case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere, in particular in relation to women and slaves, as well as in the line between citizens and non-citizens. By so strongly validating one role, that of the male citizen, it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it.\n*Originally, a male would be a citizen if his father was a citizen, Under [[Pericles]], in 450 BC, restrictions were tightened so that a citizen had to be born to an Athenian father and an Athenian mother. So ''Metroxenoi'', those with foreign mothers, were now to be excluded. These mixed marriages were also heavily penalized by the time of Demosthenes. Many Athenians prominent earlier in the century would have lost citizenship had this law applied to them: [[Cleisthenes]], the founder of democracy, had a non-Athenian mother, and the mothers of [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] were not Greek at all, but [[Thrace|Thracian]].<ref name=\"Hansen 1991 53\">[https://archive.org/details/atheniandemocrac00hans <!-- quote=offspring from slave women. --> Hansen, MH., ''The Athenian Democracy in the Age of Demosthenes: Structure, Principles, and Ideology'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1991, p.53.]</ref>\n*Likewise the status of women seems lower in Athens than in many Greek cities. In Sparta, women competed in public exercise \u2013 so in [[Aristophanes]]'s ''Lysistrata'' the Athenian women admire the tanned, muscular bodies of their Spartan counterparts \u2013 and women could own property in their own right, as they could not at Athens. [[Misogyny]] was by no means an Athenian invention, but it has been claimed that Athens had worse misogyny than other states at the time.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-U6IAgAAQBAJ&dq=athens+democracy+++worse+women&q=worse+in+athens#v=snippet&q=worse%20in%20athens&f=false Just, R., ''Women in Athenian Law and Life'', Routledge, 2008, p. 15.]</ref>\n*[[Slavery in antiquity|Slavery]] was more widespread at Athens than in other Greek cities. Indeed, the extensive use of imported non-Greeks (\"[[barbarian]]s\") as [[chattel slavery|chattel slaves]] seems to have been an Athenian development. This triggers the paradoxical question: Was democracy \"based on\" slavery? It does seem clear that possession of slaves allowed even poorer Athenians \u2014 owning a few slaves was by no means equated with wealth \u2014 to devote more of their time to political life.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&pg=PA313&dq=athens+democracy+++++slavery&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qBrVU6f2Nazb7Aar5YGQDQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=athens%20democracy%20%20%20%20%20slavery&f=false Rodriguez, JP., ''The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery'', Volume 7, ABC-CLIO, 1997, pp.&nbsp;312\u2013314.]</ref> But whether democracy depended on this extra time is impossible to say. The breadth of slave ownership also meant that the leisure of the rich (the small minority who were actually free of the need to work) rested less than it would have on the exploitation of their less well-off fellow citizens. Working for wages was clearly regarded as subjection to the will of another, but at least debt servitude had been abolished at Athens (under the reforms of Solon at the start of the 6th century BC). Allowing a new kind of equality among citizens opened the way to democracy, which in turn called for a new means, chattel slavery, to at least partially equalise the availability of leisure between rich and poor. In the absence of reliable statistics, all these connections remain speculative. However, as [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] pointed out, other societies also kept slaves but did not develop democracy. Even with respect to slavery, it is speculated that Athenian fathers had originally been able to register offspring conceived with slave women for citizenship.<ref name=\"Hansen 1991 53\"/>\n\nSince the 19th century, the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one group as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want [[representative democracy]] to be added to or even replaced by [[direct democracy]] in the Athenian way, perhaps by utilizing [[electronic democracy]]. Another group, on the other hand, considers that, since many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government, Athenian democracy was not a democracy at all. \"[C]omparisons with Athens will continue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy under modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&dq=athenian+democracy+modern+view&q=%22overlooking+the+fact+that%22#v=snippet&q=%22overlooking%20the%20fact%20that%22&f=false Grafton, A., Most, GA. and Settis, S., ''The Classical Tradition'', Harvard University Press, 2010, p.259.]</ref>\n\nGreek philosopher and activist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] has argued that \u201cthe final failure, of Athenian democracy was not due, as it is usually asserted by its critics, to the innate contradictions of democracy itself but, on the contrary, to the fact that the Athenian democracy never matured to become an [[inclusive democracy]]. This cannot be adequately explained by simply referring to the immature \u2018objective\u2019 conditions, the low development of productive forces and so on\u2014important as may be\u2014because the same objective conditions prevailed at that time in many other places all over the Mediterranean, let alone the rest of Greece, but democracy flourished only in Athens\u201d .<ref>[https://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Fotopoulos Takis, ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'', Cassell/Continuum, 1997, p.194\"]</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, most countries have claimed to be a democracy, regardless of the actual makeup of its government. Yet, after the demise of Athenian democracy, few looked upon it as a good form of government. This was because no legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the negative accounts of Plato and Aristotle. They saw it as the rule of the poor that plundered the rich, and so democracy was viewed as a sort of \"collective tyranny\". \"Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned.\" Sometimes, mixed constitutions evolved with a democratic element, but \"it definitely did not mean self-rule by citizens.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&dq=athenian+democracy+modern+view&q=%22overlooking+the+fact+that%22#v=snippet&q=%22overlooking%20the%20fact%20that%22&f=false Grafton, A., Most, GA. and Settis, S., ''The Classical Tradition'', Harvard University Press, 2010, pp.&nbsp;256\u2013259.]</ref>\n\nIn the age of [[Cicero]] and [[Caesar]], Rome was a republic, but not a democracy. Furthermore, it would be misleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important part of the 18th-century revolutionaries' intellectual background. The classical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries, as well as the English radicals, was Rome rather than Greece. Thus, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] who met in Philadelphia in 1787, did not set up a Council of the Areopagos, but a [[Senate]], that, eventually, met on the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8lPaSAnZg28C&dq=athenian+democracy+romanrepublic&q=%22it+would+be+misleading+%22#v=snippet&q=%22it%20would%20be%20misleading%20%22&f=false Hansen, MH., ''The Tradition of Ancient Greek Democracy and Its Importance for Modern Democracy'', Kgl.

In opposition, thinkers such as [[Samuel Johnson]] were worried about the ignorance of a democratic decision-making body. However, \"[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[George Grote]] saw the great strength of the Athenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed and called for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make possible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient Athenians.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OhhSc1ds4QC&pg=PA96&dq=grote++athenian+democracy&hl=en&sa=X&ei=t67cU7KEJ4ig7AbG4oCQCA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=grote%20%20athenian%20democracy&f=false Roberts, J., in Euben, JP et al., ''Athenian Political Thought and the Reconstruction of American Democracy', Cornell University Press, 1994, p. 96.]</ref>\n\nTherefore, it was George Grote, in his ''History of Greece'' (1846\u20131856), who would claim that \"Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor, nor the rule of the mob.\" He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote would people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest. Later, to the end of World War Il, democracy became dissociated from its ancient frame of reference. It was not anymore only one of the many possible ways in which political rule could be organised in a polity: it became the only possible political system in an egalitarian society.\n<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hkuPnwa3k00C&lpg=PP1&dq=Politics%3A%20Antiquity%20and%20Its%20Legacy&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Vlassopoulos, K., ''Politics Antiquity and Its Legacy'', Oxford University Press, 2009.]</ref>\n\n==References and sources==\n;References\n{{reflist|30em}}\n;Sources\n* {{cite book |last=Habicht |first=Christian |title=Athens from Alexander to Antony |publisher=Harvard |year=1997 |isbn=0-674-05111-4}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hansen |first=M.H. |year=1987 |title=The Athenian Democracy in the age of Demosthenes |url=https://archive.org/details/atheniandemocrac00hans |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-8061-3143-6}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hignett |first=Charles |title=A History of the Athenian Constitution |publisher=Oxford |year=1962 |isbn=0-19-814213-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Manville |first=B. |last2=Ober |first2=Josiah |authorlink2=Josiah Ober |year=2003 |title=A company of citizens : what the world's first democracy teaches leaders about creating great organizations |publisher=Boston}}\n*Meier C. 1998, Athens: a portrait of the city in its Golden Age (translated by R. and R.

Full dress uniforms typically include full-size [[order (distinction)|orders]] and [[medal]]s [[insignia]]. Styles tend to trace back to uniforms used during the 19th century, although the 20th century saw the adoption of [[mess dress uniform|mess-dress]] styled full-dress uniforms. Designs may depend on [[regiment]] or [[service branch]] (e.g. [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], [[marines]]). In [[Western dress codes]], full dress uniform is a permitted supplementary alternative equivalent to the [[civilian]] [[white tie]] for evening wear or [[morning dress]] for day wear \u2013 sometimes collectively called ''[[full dress]]'' \u2013 although military uniforms are the same for day and evening wear. As such, full dress uniform is the most formal uniform, followed by the [[mess dress uniform]].\n\nAlthough full dress uniforms are often brightly coloured and ornamented with gold [[epaulettes]], [[braid]]s, [[lanyard]]s, [[lampasse]]s, etc., most originated as practical uniforms that, with the adoption of even more practical uniforms, were relegated to ceremonial functions. Before [[World War I]], most armed forces of the world retained uniforms of this type that were usually more colourful and elaborate than the ordinary duty (known as ''[[undress]]''), or the active [[service dress uniform]].<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=61|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniforms|isbn=0-684-15130-8|year=1977}}</ref>\n\nWhile full dress uniform is predominantly worn at occasions by [[commissioned officer]]s and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, it may also be worn as an optional uniform by some senior [[enlisted personnel]]. It is also sometimes worn by members of [[royal court]]s, [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] or certain civilian uniformed services, although some of these may border to [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]].\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Name==\n\"Full dress uniform\" is often applied in order to distinguish from [[semi-formal]] [[mess dress uniform]]s, as well as [[informal wear|informal]] [[service dress uniform]]s.\n\nYet, full dress uniform is sometimes called ''dress uniform''. Although many services use the term ''dress'' generically for uniforms, allowing it to refer to more modern service dress (\"combat\") uniforms with suitable modifiers (e.g. the [[British Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress]]; and the [[U.S. Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress Uniform]]). Therefore, the term ''dress uniform'' without prefix typically refers to full dress uniform as described in this article.\n\n==History==\nThe [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|United States armies]] were dependent upon voluntary [[military recruitment|recruiting]] and found that a smart dress served to attract recruits and improve morale amongst those already serving. The British [[regiment|regimental system]] fostered numerous distinctions amongst different units.\n\nHowever, this was not limited to volunteer armies, with [[conscription|conscript]] armies of continental Europe retaining many of the colourful features that had evolved during the nineteenth century, for reasons of national and unit pride. Thus, in 1913 most French soldiers wore red [[trouser]]s and [[kepi]]s as part of their full dress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Andre|last=Jouineau|pages=7\u201359|title=French Army in 1914|isbn=978-2-35250-104-6|year=2008}}</ref> the majority of British foot regiments retained the [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunic]]s for [[parade]] and off duty (\"walking out\"),<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Harrington|pages=10\u2013146|title=British Army Uniforms in Color|isbn=0-7643-1302-9|year=2001}}</ref> the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was characterised by [[Prussian blue]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Becker|pages=11\u201314|title=The Kaiser's Army in Color|isbn=0-7643-1173-5|year=2000}}</ref> the Russian by dark green,<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kennedy|pages=8\u201327|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia|isbn=0-7643-1320-7|year=2001}}</ref> and the Austro-Hungary Army by a wide range of differing [[Facing (sewing)|facing colours]] dating back to the 18th century.<ref>James Lucas, \"Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914, {{ISBN|0-87052-362-7}}</ref>\n\nThere were usually exceptions to each of these rules, often distinguishing unique units. This included the German [[cuirassier]]s, who wore white full dress; British [[rifle regiment]]s, who wore [[rifle green]]; and French mountain troops who wore large [[beret]]s and light blue trousers. The U.S. Army with its \"dress blues\" was an exception, with [[cavalry]], [[artillery]] and [[infantry]] being distinguished only by the different branch colours.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume XXVII, pages 592\u2013593</ref>\n\nAfter World War I most full dress uniforms disappeared. Many of the regimes that had taken a particular pride in the retention of colourful traditional uniforms had been overthrown and their [[republic]]an, [[fascism|fascist]], or [[communism|communist]] successors had little incentive to retain old glories. Elsewhere cost and disillusion with the \"peacock\" aspects of old fashioned soldiering had a similar effect, except for ceremonial guard units and such limited exceptions as [[Officer (military)|officers]]' evening or off-duty uniforms.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=231|title=Military Fashion|isbn=0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nModern armies are characterised by simple and drably coloured dress even for ceremonial occasion, with the exceptions noted above. However a general trend towards replacing conscript armies with long serving professionals has had, as a side effect, a reversion to dress uniforms that combine smartness with some traditional features. Thus the U.S. Army announced in 2006 that uniforms of modern cut but in the traditional dark and light blue colours will become universal issue, replacing the previous grey/green service dress. The French Army has, with the abolition of conscription, reintroduced kepis, fringed [[epaulettes]] and sashes in traditional colours to wear with [[camouflage]] \"trellis\" or light beige parade dress.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|pages=89\u201390|title=L' Armee Francaise|isbn=978-2-35250-195-4|year=2012}}</ref> The British Army with its strong regimental traditions has retained a wide range of special features and dress items to distinguish individual units, in spite of recent amalgamations.<ref>Section 01.200, ''Army Dress Regulations (All Ranks)'', Ministry of Defence, January 2011</ref>  Although there still exist official patterns for full dress uniforms for each regiment or corps within the British Army, this uniform is seldom issued at public expense, except for units which are often on [[public duties]], such as the [[Guards Division]], Regimental Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], which are bought from the Regiment's allowance.<ref name=\"jsp336-3-12-1\">{{cite book|title = Joint Service Publication 336: The Defence Supply Chain Manual|edition = 3rd|url = http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000709/http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2007-11-06|accessdate = |author = British Army Dress Committee|date = August 2005|volume = Vol. 12''', Part 3, Pamphlet 12, Sect. 1 '''|page = Para. 117, 119}}</ref>\n\n==Full dress uniform by country==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Banda Militar del Regimiento de Infanter\u00eda de Patricios 2016 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Regiment of Patricians]] is one of several units in the [[Argentine Army]] whose full dress uniform dates back to the 19th century.]] \nIn the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], the [[Argentine Federal Police]], Argentine National Gendarmrie and Naval Prefecture, dress uniforms are worn during military and civil occasions, especially for the [[military band]]s and [[colour guard]]s. They are a reminder of the military and law enforcement history of Argentina, especially during the early years of nationhood and the wars of independence that the country was a part.\n\nThe [[Argentine Army]]'s full dress uniform is green with a visor cap, epaulettes, sword set and scabbard (for officers), long green pants, a black belt, and black shoes or boots. However, several regiments within the Argentine Army are authorized full dress uniforms, which originate from the 19th century, including the [[Regiment of Patricians]], the [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]], and the 1st Artillery Regiment in the Buenos Aires Garrison.\n\nThe [[Argentine Navy]] dress uniform is a [[navy blue]] [[polo shirt]] with a visor cap for officers and senior ratings and sailor caps for junior ratings, epaulettes and sleeve rank marks (for all offers), a sword set and scabbard for officers, blue long pants (skirts for female personnel), a belt and black leather shoes or boots. Marines wear [[peaked cap]]s with the dress uniform. Epaulettes are only worn with the dress uniform.\n\nFor the [[Argentine Air Force]], a similar uniform to one used by the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom, however the used the colour used is much brighter.\n\nRegardless of service branch military police personnel wear helmets with their dress uniforms, plus armbands to identify service branch.\n\n===Canada===\n====Canadian Armed Forces====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Canadian Armed Forces|Uniforms of the Royal Canadian Navy}}\n[[File:RCR Colour Presentation 2013 6.JPG|thumb|Members of the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] in full dress.

This may include amplification where the regulations are unclear or are not mandatory; amendments or reversal of some existing regulations for special occasions or events; or the promulgation of regulations regarding the wear of traditional regimental articles (such as kilts).\n\n=====Royal Military College of Canada=====\n[[File:Royal Military College of Canada band piper and bugler, Remembrance Day.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Military College of Canada Bands|Band]] members of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in full dress.]]\nThe full dress uniform for [[officer cadet]] of the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is similar to the universal full dress uniform of the Canadian Army, with minor variation.<ref name=canuni/> The full dress uniform used by the Royal Military College has remained essentially the same since the institution's founding in 1876, although the [[pillbox hat]] has replaced the [[shako]]. The [[pith helmet]] remains in use for ceremonial parade positions only.\n\n====Non-military organisations====\n=====Canadian Cadet Organisations=====\nThe [[Canadian Cadet Organizations|youth cadet programs]] in Canada, the [[Royal Canadian Army Cadets]], [[Royal Canadian Sea Cadets]] and the [[Royal Canadian Air Cadets]] each maintain their own dress uniforms. Youth-based Canadian cadet organisations are sponsored by the Canadian Armed Forces, with uniforms provided free of charge and funded by the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]]. Full dress uniforms worn by cadets are modeled after the organisation's sponsoring service branch.\n\n=====Royal Canadian Mounted Police=====\nThe modern dress uniform of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is closely based on the everyday uniforms used by the predecessor [[North West Mounted Police]] in the late nineteenth century.  It features the [[Red Serge]], a scarlet British-style military pattern tunic, complete with a high-neck collar and dark blue [[breeches]] with yellow stripes derived from British and Canadian cavalry uniforms of the same era, and usually a [[campaign hat]] (or \"[[stetson]]\") and brown [[riding boots]].\n\n=== Chile ===\n==== Chilean Air Force ====\nThe full dress uniform of the [[Chilean Air Force]] since 2001 has been a medium-blue tunic and trousers, worn with a peaked visor cap. For parade dress, officers additionally wear a sword belt.\n\n==== Chilean Army ====\n[[File:Caballeria del Ej\u00e9rcito en Izamiento gran Bandera Nacional.jpg|left|thumb|Though full dress uniform in the [[Chilean Army]] typically is ''[[feldgrau]]'', some units wear more colorful uniforms; here, a ceremonial cavalry unit wears a dress uniform based on an early twentieth-century uniform of German [[dragoons]].]]\nThe usual full dress uniform of the [[Chilean Army]] is based on twentieth-century German ''[[feldgrau]]'' uniforms; however, several units wear more colorful full dress uniforms. Cadets of the military academy \"Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme\" wear a [[Prussian blue]] uniform with ''[[Pickelhaube]]'', based on the uniform worn by the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelmine]] [[Guards Corps (German Empire)|foot guard regiments]]. Some military units, including the Chacabuco and Rancagua regiments, wear a uniform from the War of the Pacific during parades, with [[kepi]]s as headdress. The Buin regiment (2nd Army division in the Santiago Metropolitan region) has reintroduced the infantry regimental uniform of the [[Chilean War of Independence]], having been formed in December 1810 as the 1st Infantry Regiment \"Chilean Grenadiers\", the original unit of the Chilean Army. The 1st Cavalry Regiment and the Krupp Artillery Battery of the 1st Artillery Regiment, both ceremonial units of the Army, have since 2012 worn the early twentieth-century Prussian-style full dress uniforms of the Army's cavalry and artillery branches.\n\n==== Chilean Navy ====\nThe [[Chilean Navy|Chilean naval]] officer's dress uniform is navy-blue with visored hat, sword strap (for petty officers and cadets, only during parades and ceremonies), navy-blue trousers, and black boots. The enlisted uniform (for sailors and petty officers) evinces a mix of Prussian and British influences, having a sailor cap with the dress while the Marine enlisted and NCO uniform is a dark-blue polo with trousers and a belt plus a peaked cap.\n\nThe dress uniform of the naval academy \"Arturo Prat\" is also blue with trousers, but with headdress similar to that worn by Prat and the crew of the ''Esmeralda'' during the [[Battle of Iquique]] in 1879.\n\n===France===\nAs with many European countries, the French military used in the 19th and early 20th c. many traditional and heavily decorated dress uniforms.

Founded as a [[military academy]], the institution was transformed into a state-sponsored civilian [[post-secondary education|post-secondary school]] in 1970, although still operated by the French [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\n====National Gendarmerie====\n[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t110458.jpg|thumb|French [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] infantry in full dress uniform.]]\nThe [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] of the National Gendarmerie is the last unit to wear dress uniform as service uniform, as [[guard of honour]] detachments are required to wear it while on duty. The cavalry regiment wear a 19th-century [[dragoon]] uniform, with metal helmet and white riding trousers, while the infantry regiments use a high-collared traditional gendarmerie uniform. The officer cadets and the staff of [[\u00e9cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale]] also use uniforms whose styling dates back to the 19th century.\n\n===Indonesia===\n[[File:Gatot Nurmantyo.jpg|thumb|upright|Former [[Indonesian Army]] general [[Gatot Nurmantyo]] dressed in PDU I, the [[Indonesian Army]]'s equivalent to full dress uniform]]\nThe [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], [[Indonesian National Police]], and other uniformed institutions of the country have their own types of Dress uniforms known as \"PDU\", an abbreviation from ''Pakaian Dinas Upacara'' literally meaning \"ceremonial uniform\" in [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]]; worn during formal occasions and when attending ceremonies. The Dress uniform (PDU) of the National Armed Forces consists of several categories which are:\n{{col div}}\n*PDU I - ([[Service medal]]s and [[Brevet (military)|brevets]] attached)  \n*PDU IA - ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia#Star decorations|Order decorations]] attached and [[Sash#Honorific orders|honorary sash]] worn over for those who are entitled to wear it)\n*PDU II - ([[Mess dress uniform#Indonesia|Mess dress uniform]])\n*PDU IIA - (Mess dress uniform with order decorations attached)  \n*PDU III - ([[Service ribbons]] attached)\n*PDU IV - (Short sleeved, with no [[necktie]] worn).<ref>Indonesian National Armed Forces Commander decree, dated 16 Mei 2019, regarding the Uniform, Attributes, Medals, and Rank Insignia of the Indonesian Armed Forces</ref>\n{{col div end}}\nEach uniform category is worn for different purposes and for certain occasions. The \"PDU I\" and \"PDU IA\" are regarded as \"full dress uniforms\" which are worn for formal state occasions and when attending ceremonial events of high significance. The headdress worn for this uniform is a peaked cap for men and a crusher cap for women, and for officers from special forces, as well as the Military Police, may wear their respective berets. When wearing the Mess dress uniform, no headdress is worn.\n\nThe \"PDU III\" uniform is worn during receptions and/or during the welcoming ceremony of a visiting high ranking foreign guest ([[head of state]] or head of government). While the \"PDU IV\" uniform is worn for occasions such as: [[Change of Command]] ceremonies, attending a [[passing out parade]], and worn by [[Military justice|military judges]] in the court.<ref>[https://dokumen.tips/documents/penggunaan-kelengkapan-dan-atribut-tni-ad.html Usage, Attributes, and Uniform of the Indonesian Army ]</ref> The mess dress uniform is basically the same for the three branches of the armed forces.

These are similar in style to civilian business dress suits, or to the service dress uniforms worn by the British forces. The dress uniform includes a [[Blazer|blazer-type]] jacket, worn with a white shirt, and a tie. The ground forces uniform is dark green, with a single-breasted, three-buttoned jacket and tie of the same colour. Headgear worn is the beret. The air force uniform is of the same design, but medium blue. The naval uniform has a darker blue, double-breasted, six-buttoned jacket, with gold-coloured rank insignia on the cuffs.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/generals-get-a-makeover-with-new-dress-uniforms/ '' Dressed to kill: Generals get a makeover with new dress uniforms'', by Judah Ari Gross.

Some features of modern full dress uniform worn by both army and navy personnel date from those of the final Czarist period, prior to 1917. Most notably these include the blue-green shade of the modern army officer's parade and walking out uniform; the dark blue and white dress uniform still worn by sailors; and the ceremonial dress of the Kremlin Regiment.\n\n=== Sweden===\n{{Further|Swedish Military Uniform}}\n{{see also|Mess dress uniform#Full mess dress}}\n[[File:Swedish Royal Guard Bastille Day 2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Officer of the Life Company of the Swedish Lifeguards (2007)]]\nVarious forms of full dress uniforms were used by all regiments of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] for ceremonial purposes until the 1960s, when they were generally discontinued, with the exception of the [[Svea Life Guards]] and the [[Life Guard Dragoons (Sweden)|Life Guard Dragoons]] still retaining colourful full dress uniforms of 19th century origin for ceremonial use. The remaining parts of the branches tend to apply a variant of the [[mess dress uniform]] called \"full mess uniform\" for formal wear purposes. White [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] and belts may also be added to their service dress uniforms for parades or certain ceremonial purposes.\n\n==== Swedish Army ====\nThere are three versions of full dress uniforms in use in the [[Swedish Army]] as of the present day, all belonging to the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The infantry wears the dark blue uniform of the Svea Life Guards (1st Life Guards) with yellow collar, cuffs and piping which dates back to 1886. The [[Royal Swedish Army Band|Swedish Army Band]] wears the uniform of G\u00f6ta Life Guards (2nd Life Guards), with red collar, cuffs and piping. The headdress of the infantry is mainly the pickelhaube typed helmet in black leather from 1887. On state ceremonies, a white buffalo hair plume is added. [[Bearskin hat]]s dating from 1823 are still in use on special occasions.\n\nThe cavalry, including the [[Life Guards' Dragoon Music Corps|Swedish Cavalry Band]], wear the [[royal blue]] uniform of the Life Guard Dragoons (1st Cavalry) from 1895. Officers have a somewhat lighter colour on their full dress uniform compared to the troopers. The pickelhaube type helmet is made of nickel-plated steel with [[brass]] details and dates back to 1879. Changes were made in 1900 which transformed the helmet into a cuirassier style helmet. In 1928 with the amalgamation of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Regiments, a helm wreath was added, together with a golden laurel wreath. Officers' gold chin straps with lion \"mascarons\" from the [[Life Regiment Dragoons]] (2nd Cavalry) were also authorised for the new composite regiment. On modern state occasions officers wear white buffalo hair plume while troopers wear a horse hair plumes of the same colour.\n\n==== Swedish Navy ====\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010 0c176 2128.jpg|thumb|Two officers in full dress on the royal barge ''Vasaorden''. In the [[Swedish Navy]], full dress is restricted to naval officers serving on the ''Vasaorden'']]\nIn the [[Swedish Navy]], only one ceremonial uniform is still in use. It is restricted to naval officers serving on the royal barge \"Vasaorden\" (Order of Vasa); a ship used only on rare ceremonial occasions. The uniform dates back to 1878.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n==== British Army ====\n{{Main|Uniforms of the British Army}}\nMost of the various uniforms worn by the [[British Army Uniforms|British Army]] today originate in former combat uniforms. At the start of the 19th century, British Army [[Regiment of Foot|Regiments of Foot]], trained to fight in the manner dictated by a weapon (the [[musket]]) which demanded close proximity to the target, were not concerned with camouflage, and wore red coats (scarlet for officers and sergeants). Rifle regiments, fighting as [[skirmishers]], and equipped with [[rifle]]s, were more concerned with concealment however, and wore dark green uniforms. [[Light Infantry]] regiments were also trained as skirmishers but wore red uniforms with green shakos. Whereas the infantry generally wore polished brass [[button]]s and white carrying equipment, the Rifles wore black.\n[[File:British old infantry uniforms.jpg|thumb|Infantry uniforms of the [[British Army]], from 1750\u20131835. Full dress uniforms in the British Army originate from former combat uniforms.]]\nHeavy [[dragoon]]s and [[Royal Engineers]] wore red (or later scarlet) coats. Most of the remainder of the British Army, however, including the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]], [[hussar]]s, all but one [[lancer]] regiment, and various support elements wore dark blue uniforms{{cn|date=February 2020}}. These varied greatly in detail according to the arm of service or in many cases the individual regiment. [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Reserve]] units were for the most part distinguished by having silver (rather than gold-coloured) lace, buttons and accoutrements in full dress. From the [[Crimean War]] on, a narrow red stripe (piping) down the outside of each trouser leg was common to all red coated infantry units. Cavalry however wore stripes of regimental colour (white, yellow, blue/grey etc.) on their riding breeches. Scottish [[:Category:Highland regiments|Highland regiments]] did not wear trousers, favouring the kilt, and Scottish Lowland regiments adopted tartan [[trews]]. All [[Scottish regiment]]s wore [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] of distinctive cut instead of the tunics of English, Irish and Welsh units.\n\nFull dress headwear varied (both from regiment to regiment, and over time as influenced by military fashion): bearskins were worn by the Foot Guards, the [[2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]] and (in a different form) by Fusiliers. Plumed helmets were worn by the Dragoons (except 2nd), Dragoon Guards and the Household Cavalry. Hussars wore their distinctive [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]], which also came to be adopted by the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and certain other Corps; it was also worn in a different form by Rifle regiments. The Lancers had their [[chapka]]. Infantry of the line often wore shakos (later supplanted by the 'home service helmet'), as did others; though Scots and Irish regiments tended to have their own distinctive full-dress headwear. General officers and staff officers usually wore plumed [[cocked hat]]s in full dress, as did regimental staff officers and those of some support services. In hotter climates, for all of the above, a white [[pith helmet]] was often substituted.\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|thumb|left|The rise of [[rifle]]s and [[smokeless powder]] led to the adoption of [[khaki]] uniforms in the field, with blue, scarlet, and rifle green tunics relegated to ceremonial/parade use.]]\nBeginning with the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, the British Army began adopting light [[khaki]] uniforms for [[Tropical]] service that was first introduced in 1848 with the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]] in India.<ref>\"Khaki Uniform 1848\u201349: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research; JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004); pp 341\u2013347</ref> This innovation arose from experience fighting irregular forces in India, for example on the Indian North-West Frontier and during the [[Indian Mutiny]], and in Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], as well as the invention of [[smokeless gunpowder]] and the increasing effectiveness and usage of rifles. In 1902 a darker shade of ''[[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]'' (SD) was adopted for field and ordinary use in Britain itself.  The scarlet, blue and rifle green uniforms were retained for wear as full dress on parade and \"walking-out dress\" when off duty and out of barracks. As worn between 1902 and 1914 by all non-commissioned ranks, walking-out dress was essentially the same as review order, except that a peaked cap or glengarry was worn instead of the full dress headdress and overalls (strapped trousers) were substituted for cavalry breeches.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, pages=236 & 237, \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books Ltd, 1972</ref>\n\nWhen khaki web carrying equipment was introduced, the earlier, white or black leather carrying equipment was retained for wear with the dress uniform. As with the earlier uniforms, the officers' uniforms differed in quality and detail from those worn by the [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]]. Officers purchased their own dress uniforms from regimentally approved [[tailor]]s while other ranks were issued all orders of dress from government stocks.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 all full dress and other coloured uniforms ceased to be worn by the British Army. After 1919 they were restored to the [[Household Cavalry]] and Foot Guard for ceremonial purposes but not to the bulk of the army. Officers were authorised to wear full dress for certain special occasions such as Court levees (formal presentations to the Monarch) and it was customary to wear these uniforms at social functions such as weddings. By 1928 bands were wearing full dress on occasions where they were not parading with the remainder of the regiment (who had only khaki service dress). The pre-1914 dress uniforms were still held in store and occasionally reappeared for historic displays. However, there was no serious attempt to make them general issue again, primarily for reasons of expense.  When (khaki) Battle Dress (BD) uniforms, which had a short ''blouse'' instead of a tunic, were adopted immediately before the Second World War, the older khaki Service Dress became a smart uniform for wear on the streets, and on moderately formal occasions.\n\nAfter World War II the coloured, full dress uniforms were again reintroduced for ceremonial occasions by the [[Brigade of Guards]] and to a limited extent by regimental bands. Officers (and later senior non-commissioned officers) resumed wearing [[mess uniform]]s in traditional colours from about 1956 on. These are still worn, although regimental  amalgamations have led to numerous changes from the pre-war models.\n[[File:The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scottish regiment]]s retain a number of historical elements in their uniform, including their [[kilt]]s and [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]s]]\nWith limited exceptions, the unique regimental full dress uniforms finally disappeared after 1939; today they are only generally worn, on ceremonial occasions, by the Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], by certain representatives on parade (e.g. some regimental [[Pioneer Sergeant|Pioneers]], or those forming a guard of honour) and by the regiments of the [[Household Division]].  In most regiments they were replaced by a generic dark blue uniform known as No 1 Dress. This dated back to plain \"patrol\" uniforms worn by officers before 1914 as an informal \"undress\" uniform. An early version had been worn by some units in the 1937 [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] but had not been made general issue at the time. In the form adopted after World War II, most regiments were distinguished only by coloured piping on the shoulder straps, coloured hat bands, buttons and badges. However Scottish regiments retained their kilts or trews as well as the distinctive doublets (in \"piper green\" or dark blue) of the former scarlet uniform.\n\nRifles regiments had dark green uniforms and cavalry retained a number of special features such as the crimson trousers of the [[11th Hussars]] or the quartered caps of lancer regiments.  A white, lightweight tunic (No 3 Dress) was also authorised for use in the [[tropics]], or during the summer months in warmer temperate climates (such as [[Bermuda Garrison|Bermuda]]). The blue \"home service\" helmets were not worn as part of the No 1 dress uniform, except by members of some bands or corps of drums which retained their old full dress uniforms, at regimental expense. English Rifle regiments were amalgamated into the [[Royal Green Jackets]], which continued to wear a dark green dress uniform, and black buttons and belts. Recent changes have brought the [[Royal Green Jackets]] and [[The Light Infantry]] together into a single regiment [[The Rifles]], which continues to wear dark green.\n[[File:Waterloo Band of The Rifles.jpg|thumb|The Waterloo Band of [[The Rifles]] in full dress. The Rifles continue to use [[rifle green]] in their full dress uniform.]]\nBerets were introduced initially into the [[Royal Tank Corps]] in the First World War and their use became more widespread in the British Army during and after the Second World War to replace side caps for wear with combat uniforms when protective headgear was not being worn. Originally, khaki was the standard colour for all units, but specialist units adopted coloured berets to distinguish themselves. For example, [[airborne forces]] adopted a [[Maroon (color)|maroon]]. This has since been adopted by many other parachute units around the world. The [[British Commandos|Commandos]] adopted a [[green beret]]. The [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) initially adopted a white beret quickly changing this to a [[beige]] or sand coloured one.  From 1944 they wore the Maroon airborne forces beret but the beige beret was re-adopted following the re-formation of the Regular SAS in Malaya.\nKhaki was replaced as a generic colour for berets after the war by dark blue, and this is the colour worn by those units not authorised to use a distinctively coloured beret.\n\nA peaked cap, with a coloured hat band, is intended to be worn with the No 1 Dress uniform, berets are the most common form of headdress seen with other orders of dress and are worn in No1 and 2 dress by some Regiments and Corps. \n\nThe blue or green No 1 Dress was never universally adopted after its initial introduction in 1947. The reason was mainly one of economy, although it was sometimes criticised as being too similar to police and other civilian uniforms \u2013 lacking the immediately recognisable military status of both scarlet and khaki. Khaki No 2 dress being the most usual order of dress for parades and formal occasions.\n[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|Officer cadets at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in full dress.]]\nAs noted above, the practice of issuing other ranks in line regiments with full sets of both service dress and dress uniforms effectively ended in 1914 and was never completely returned to. Today, with the exceptions noted above, full dress or No 1 Dress uniforms are only held in limited quantities as common stock, and issued only to detachments on occasional special ceremonial occasions. Practices do however vary between units and historic items of uniform are more likely to appear where tradition is particularly strong. As an example, the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] wore scarlet and blue \"review order\" uniforms until World War I, substituted khaki service dress for parade from 1919 to 1939  and now holds dark blue No 1 dress uniforms for the use of its cadets. The [[Royal Military Police]] retain the latter order of dress for general issue{{cn|date=February 2020}}.\n\n==== Royal Air Force ====\n{{See also|Uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}\n[[File:Sir Philip Game.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Philip Game]] in full dress, c. 1930. At the time, the [[Royal Air Force]]'s full dress included headgear that resembled helmets used in [[World War I]].]]\nHistorically, the [[Royal Air Force]] regulations permitted the wearing of a full dress uniform in both home and warm-weather variants. Although the home wear version of full dress is no longer worn (except in a modified form by RAF bandsmen),<ref>[http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_music.htm]</ref> the tropical full ceremonial dress continues to be authorised.\n\nThe temperate full dress uniform was introduced in April 1920. It consisted of a single-breasted jacket in blue-grey with a stand-up collar. Rank was indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve and white gloves were worn. As with the British Army after 1914, full dress was not general issue during the inter-War period, but was authorized for wear by specific categories such as bandsmen and commissioned officers. The latter generally wore full dress only for infrequent occasions such as attendance at court [[levees]] and social functions such as weddings. Military attaches and royal [[aides de camp]] were amongst the few serving officers who might have regular occasions to wear full dress.\n\nInitially the full dress uniform was worn with the service dress cap. However, in 1921 a new form of head-dress was introduced. It was designed to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull cap trimmed with black rabbit fur. The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected to an RAF badge. This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.\n\n[[Group Captain]] the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) wore RAF full dress at his wedding to Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923. The Duke wore or carried the full dress headgear rather than the service dress cap.\n\n====Royal Navy====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Royal Navy}}\n[[File:Vaspw.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vice Admiral]] [[Philip Watson]] in ceremonial day dress. Introduced in 1960, ceremonial day dress is a variant of the [[Royal Navy]]'s full dress uniform that was taken out of service in 1956.]]\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, when naval uniforms were introduced, Flag Officers had different full-dress and undress versions, the latter being worn from day to day, the former only for formal occasions. By the late nineteenth century, an officer's full dress uniform consisted of a navy double-breasted tailcoat with white facings edged in gold (on the collar and cuff-slashes), gold lace (indicating rank) on the cuffs, epaulettes, sword and sword-belt, worn with gold-laced trousers and a cocked hat. This order of uniform lasted through the first half of the twentieth century, and was worn by Prince Philip at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1956, however, it was abolished, leaving No. 1 uniform as the most formal order of dress. Subsequently, in 1960, full dress uniform was reintroduced in the form of [[Royal Navy uniform#Ceremonial Day Dress|Ceremonial Day Dress]]. Worn only by limited categories of senior officers this is very similar to the old full dress, but without fringed epaulettes and slashes, and worn with a peaked cap.\n\n====Civilian organisations====\nThe formal uniforms used by police forces were until the late 20th century mostly the same as the uniforms worn on ordinary duties but sometimes with various embellishments. The introduction of newer uniforms deliberately designed as workwear has left the older styles mainly used for ceremonial or formal purposes. The general formal style is a black jacket and trousers with a white shirt and a [[custodian helmet]] or peaked cap. A particular variation is that used by mounted police in Merseyside which can be observed when they escort the winner of the annual Grand National horse race at Aintree; this consists of the traditional ''Custodian helmet'' with an added white plume and silvered chinstrap; along with the style of tunic it bears more resemblance to a late 19th/early 20th century police uniform.\n\n=== United States ===\n====U.S. Air Force====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Air Force}}\nIn the mid-1980s, \"ceremonial blue\" uniform and \"ceremonial white\" uniform were introduced in the [[United States Air Force]].

It is the only uniform of the United States military to use all of the colours of the nation's flag and incorporates button designs which are the oldest military insignia still in use in the United States Armed Forces to this day.\n[[File:Plate IV, Enlisted Blue Dress Uniforms - U.S. Marine Corps Uniforms 1983 (1984), by Donna J.

Enlisted coats have a red trim and more buttons down the middle of the coat than officers.\n* Dress Blue \"B\" is the same as \"A\", but service ribbons and marksmanship [[Badges of the United States Marine Corps|badges]] are worn instead of medals. Dress Blue \"A\" (with medals worn) is strictly reserved for official ceremonies, while Dress Blue \"B\" may be worn on leave or liberty.\n* Dress Blue \"C\" is the dress blue uniform worn with the long sleeve khaki shirt (without coat). Service ribbons and badges may be worn.\n* Dress Blue \"D\" is the dress blue uniform worn with the short sleeve khaki shirt (without coat). Service ribbons and badges may be worn\n\nAll the blue uniforms have the same trousers, cover, and black shoes, with the exception of general officers who wear dark blue trousers in the same colour as the coat. Officers, [[Staff Noncommissioned Officer]]s, and [[non-commissioned officer|Noncommissioned Officer]]s wear [[blood stripe]]s on their trousers. Blood stripes are 1.25\" in width for NCOs and SNCOs, 1.5\" for officers, and 2\" for general officers.\n\nA sword may be worn when the individual is in command of troops in formation\u2014the [[Mameluke sword]] for officers, the [[Marine Noncommissioned Officers' Sword, 1859-Present|NCO sword]] for NCOs and SNCOs. When wearing the sword and Dress Blue coat, officers wear the [[Sam Browne belt]]. For enlisted, the sword is worn with a white waistbelt and brass buckle when wearing the Dress Blue coat. The Marine Corps is the only branch of the United States military which regularly allows NCOs to carry a sword.  For enlisted Marines, they earn the right to carry the NCO sword  and wear the scarlet blood stripe on their blue trousers when they achieve the rank of Corporal.\n[[File:United States Marine Corps Mounted Color Guard (32229627435).jpg|left|thumb|Dress uniform for the Marine Corps Mounted Colour Guard consists of a blue dress coat, white [[breeches]], and polished knee-high boots.]]\nMembers of the [[United States Marine Corps Band]], and the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] are authorized different dress uniforms, known as Red-Dress (a scarlet blouse with a blue trim). Before 1998, certain ceremonial Marine units, such as the [[Silent Drill Platoon]], wore a blue/white dress uniform in which white trousers were substituted for blue while performing ceremonial functions. The blue/white version is now an authorized summer uniform for officers, SNCOs, and on certain functions, NCOs.

No blood stripes were authorized, and white shoes were worn. This uniform was superseded by the Blue/White Dress uniform in 2000.\n\n==== U.S. Navy ====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Navy}}\nThe Dress White uniform consists of a stand-collar white tunic, white trousers, and white dress shoes. Rank for officers is displayed on [[shoulder marks]] for males and on the sleeve cuffs for females, while CPO rank insignia is worn on the collar for both sexes. Service dress white includes service ribbons, whereas full dress white includes service ribbons and medals. This uniform is informally called \"Chokers\", due to the stand-collar.\n[[File:US Navy 091002-N-3442D-001 Members of the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stand at parade rest before the start of the retirement ceremony for Rear Adm.

As with the white uniforms, only service ribbons are worn with Service Dress Blue, while service ribbons and medals are worn with Full Dress Blue. Depending on the occasion, officers may also wear [[sword]]s with either Full Dress White or Blue. Both the white and blue uniforms are worn with the distinctive peaked cap with white cover.\n\nNaval enlisted personnel ranked [[Petty Officer First Class]], E-6, and below also have seasonal uniforms. The dress white and blue uniforms are both of the traditional \"[[sailor suit]]\" or [[Cracker Jack|crackerjack]] type for men, and women wear the same as summertime dress white uniform. It consists of a pullover shirt, called a [[Sweater|jumper]], with a V-neck going to a square collar flap, a black [[neckerchief]], and bell-bottomed trousers. The white uniform is worn with a white belt and silver buckle, and the sleeves come down to the middle of the hand. The blue uniform features the thirteen button trousers, and has three rows of white piping on the collar and cuffs. Women wear a uniform similar to female officers and Chiefs, but with silver buttons, and a cover device with a spread eagle and \"USN\".\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nBefore 1972, U.S. Coast Guard personnel generally wore the same uniforms as the U.S. Navy but with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, primarily distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and differentiated uniform buttons on dress uniforms.\n[[File:Coast Guard Full Dress Blue uniform.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Coast Guard]] in Full Dress Blue during a change of command ceremony at [[Coast Guard Base Kodiak]].]]\nPresently, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains two full dress uniforms, full dress blue, and full dress white.<ref name=uscg/> Full dress blue is worn during change of command ceremonies, parades, and reviews when special honours are being paid, including state visits.<ref name=uscg/> The full dress blue uniforms are similar to the U.S. Coast Guard's service dress blue \"Alpha,\" except that it is worn with a full-size medals instead of ribbons. Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and a white belt and glove may be required.\n\nFull Dress White is worn for similar occasions by officers of the U.S. Coast Guard during the summer, or when in tropical environments.<ref name=uscg/> The Dress White uniform is slightly different depending on the gender; with men wearing a high stand-collared white tunic, white trousers, and white shoes, while women wear a uniform similar to the dress blue uniform but with a white coat and skirt or trousers. Both genders wear shoulder boards rather than sleeve stripes, as well as medals, combination cover, and sword. The uniform is nearly identical to the U.S. Navy's Full Dress Whites, but the buttons and combination cover device are Coast Guard specific.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] maintains two different styles of parade dress uniforms. Both variants include a black blouse, with banded collars and double row of buttons, and a white peaked hat. However, Full Dress Blue A, uses white trousers, whereas Full Dress Blue B uses black trousers.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nWithin the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] dress uniforms are commonplace within its services.\n\nThe Presidential Honor Guard Brigade wears dress uniforms similar to those used by the Hussar troop raised by Simon Bolivar in 1816. It is of a red tunic with gold buttons and black pants, belt and a black (formerly brown) busby hat, plus epaulettes worn by officers. The Caracas Battalion of the Ministry of Defence wears a light blue uniform with white buttons, black pants, a belt, boots or black shoes and the red beret while the Daniel O'Leary Battalion of the Army Headquarters wears an identical uniform but with the dark blue beret.\n\n==Full dress uniform by non-directly military organisations==\n===St John Ambulance===\n{{further|Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)}}\n[[File:SJAM Parade1.jpg|thumb|Individuals leading a group of [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia]] (SJAM) volunteers wearing SJAM's ceremonial uniform.]]\n[[St John Ambulance]] is a volunteer group of affiliated organisations in 42 countries, which aims to teach and provide [[first aid]], and [[emergency medical services]]. The organisation uses a number of uniforms, including a ceremonial one. The affiliated national organisations do not share a standardized ceremonial uniform, known as formal uniform or dress uniform depending on the country.\n\nThe uniform of St John Ambulance in [[St. John Ambulance Canada|Canada]], [[St John Ambulance in England|England]], [[St John Ambulance Ireland|Ireland]], and [[St John Ambulance in Wales|Wales]] was derived from the uniforms of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]]; using similar jackets and trousers with different buttons, badges, and a cap with a white band and belt-mounted items relevant to first-aid work. Conversely, the ceremonial uniform for St John Ambulance in [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[St John Singapore]] uses a white tunic and black trousers; derived from the British Army's warm weather ceremonial uniform. Generally, the organisation's ceremonial uniform is not used for daily medical and first-aid work, with the various national St John Ambulance organisations issuing a variety of occupational uniforms.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Military uniform]]\n**[[Mess dress uniform]]\n**[[Service dress uniform]]\n**[[Combat uniform]]\n* [[Formal wear]]\n** [[Morning dress]]\n** [[White tie]]\n** [[Ceremonial dress]]\n** [[Religious clothing]]\n** [[Folk costume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Full dress uniforms}}\n\n{{Clothing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dress Uniform}}\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Formal wear]]\n[[Category:Uniforms]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the most formal military uniform|military uniforms in general|military uniform}}\n{{short description|Uniform for wear on formal occasions}}\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2005 (62867328).jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A [[trooper]] and a [[Cornet]] of the [[Blues and Royals]], a [[British Army]] cavalry regiment, in full dress uniform.]]\n{{Western dress codes}}\n'''Full dress uniform''' or '''parade dress uniform''' is the most [[formal wear|formal]] type of [[uniform]]s used by [[military]], [[police]], [[firefighter|fire]] and other public [[uniformed services]] for official [[parade (military)|parade]]s, [[ceremonies]], and receptions, including private ones such as [[marriage]]s and [[funeral]]s. Full dress uniforms typically include full-size [[order (distinction)|orders]] and [[medal]]s [[insignia]]. Styles tend to trace back to uniforms used during the 19th century, although the 20th century saw the adoption of [[mess dress uniform|mess-dress]] styled full-dress uniforms. Designs may depend on [[regiment]] or [[service branch]] (e.g. [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], [[marines]]). In [[Western dress codes]], full dress uniform is a permitted supplementary alternative equivalent to the [[civilian]] [[white tie]] for evening wear or [[morning dress]] for day wear \u2013 sometimes collectively called ''[[full dress]]'' \u2013 although military uniforms are the same for day and evening wear. As such, full dress uniform is the most formal uniform, followed by the [[mess dress uniform]].\n\nAlthough full dress uniforms are often brightly coloured and ornamented with gold [[epaulettes]], [[braid]]s, [[lanyard]]s, [[lampasse]]s, etc., most originated as practical uniforms that, with the adoption of even more practical uniforms, were relegated to ceremonial functions. Before [[World War I]], most armed forces of the world retained uniforms of this type that were usually more colourful and elaborate than the ordinary duty (known as ''[[undress]]''), or the active [[service dress uniform]].<ref>{{cite book|first=W.Y.|last=Carman|page=61|title=A Dictionary of Military Uniforms|isbn=0-684-15130-8|year=1977}}</ref>\n\nWhile full dress uniform is predominantly worn at occasions by [[commissioned officer]]s and [[non-commissioned officer]]s, it may also be worn as an optional uniform by some senior [[enlisted personnel]]. It is also sometimes worn by members of [[royal court]]s, [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]] or certain civilian uniformed services, although some of these may border to [[Court uniform and dress in the United Kingdom|court uniforms]].\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Name==\n\"Full dress uniform\" is often applied in order to distinguish from [[semi-formal]] [[mess dress uniform]]s, as well as [[informal wear|informal]] [[service dress uniform]]s.\n\nYet, full dress uniform is sometimes called ''dress uniform''. Although many services use the term ''dress'' generically for uniforms, allowing it to refer to more modern service dress (\"combat\") uniforms with suitable modifiers (e.g. the [[British Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress]]; and the [[U.S. Army]]'s obsolete [[Battle Dress Uniform]]). Therefore, the term ''dress uniform'' without prefix typically refers to full dress uniform as described in this article.\n\n==History==\nThe [[British Army|British]] and [[United States Army|United States armies]] were dependent upon voluntary [[military recruitment|recruiting]] and found that a smart dress served to attract recruits and improve morale amongst those already serving. The British [[regiment|regimental system]] fostered numerous distinctions amongst different units.\n\nHowever, this was not limited to volunteer armies, with [[conscription|conscript]] armies of continental Europe retaining many of the colourful features that had evolved during the nineteenth century, for reasons of national and unit pride. Thus, in 1913 most French soldiers wore red [[trouser]]s and [[kepi]]s as part of their full dress,<ref>{{cite book|first=Andre|last=Jouineau|pages=7\u201359|title=French Army in 1914|isbn=978-2-35250-104-6|year=2008}}</ref> the majority of British foot regiments retained the [[Red coat (military uniform)|scarlet tunic]]s for [[parade]] and off duty (\"walking out\"),<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Harrington|pages=10\u2013146|title=British Army Uniforms in Color|isbn=0-7643-1302-9|year=2001}}</ref> the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was characterised by [[Prussian blue]],<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Becker|pages=11\u201314|title=The Kaiser's Army in Color|isbn=0-7643-1173-5|year=2000}}</ref> the Russian by dark green,<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert W.|last=Kennedy|pages=8\u201327|title=Uniforms of Imperial & Soviet Russia|isbn=0-7643-1320-7|year=2001}}</ref> and the Austro-Hungary Army by a wide range of differing [[Facing (sewing)|facing colours]] dating back to the 18th century.<ref>James Lucas, \"Fighting Troops of the Austro-Hungarian Army 1868-1914, {{ISBN|0-87052-362-7}}</ref>\n\nThere were usually exceptions to each of these rules, often distinguishing unique units. This included the German [[cuirassier]]s, who wore white full dress; British [[rifle regiment]]s, who wore [[rifle green]]; and French mountain troops who wore large [[beret]]s and light blue trousers. The U.S. Army with its \"dress blues\" was an exception, with [[cavalry]], [[artillery]] and [[infantry]] being distinguished only by the different branch colours.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh Edition, Volume XXVII, pages 592\u2013593</ref>\n\nAfter World War I most full dress uniforms disappeared. Many of the regimes that had taken a particular pride in the retention of colourful traditional uniforms had been overthrown and their [[republic]]an, [[fascism|fascist]], or [[communism|communist]] successors had little incentive to retain old glories. Elsewhere cost and disillusion with the \"peacock\" aspects of old fashioned soldiering had a similar effect, except for ceremonial guard units and such limited exceptions as [[Officer (military)|officers]]' evening or off-duty uniforms.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Mollo|page=231|title=Military Fashion|isbn=0-214-65349-8}}</ref>\n\nModern armies are characterised by simple and drably coloured dress even for ceremonial occasion, with the exceptions noted above. However a general trend towards replacing conscript armies with long serving professionals has had, as a side effect, a reversion to dress uniforms that combine smartness with some traditional features. Thus the U.S. Army announced in 2006 that uniforms of modern cut but in the traditional dark and light blue colours will become universal issue, replacing the previous grey/green service dress. The French Army has, with the abolition of conscription, reintroduced kepis, fringed [[epaulettes]] and sashes in traditional colours to wear with [[camouflage]] \"trellis\" or light beige parade dress.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Galliac|pages=89\u201390|title=L' Armee Francaise|isbn=978-2-35250-195-4|year=2012}}</ref> The British Army with its strong regimental traditions has retained a wide range of special features and dress items to distinguish individual units, in spite of recent amalgamations.<ref>Section 01.200, ''Army Dress Regulations (All Ranks)'', Ministry of Defence, January 2011</ref>  Although there still exist official patterns for full dress uniforms for each regiment or corps within the British Army, this uniform is seldom issued at public expense, except for units which are often on [[public duties]], such as the [[Guards Division]], Regimental Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], which are bought from the Regiment's allowance.<ref name=\"jsp336-3-12-1\">{{cite book|title = Joint Service Publication 336: The Defence Supply Chain Manual|edition = 3rd|url = http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000709/http://www.aof.mod.uk/content/docs/jsp336/3rd_ed/vol12/pt3/pam12/s1.doc|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2007-11-06|accessdate = |author = British Army Dress Committee|date = August 2005|volume = Vol. 12''', Part 3, Pamphlet 12, Sect. 1 '''|page = Para. 117, 119}}</ref>\n\n==Full dress uniform by country==\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Banda Militar del Regimiento de Infanter\u00eda de Patricios 2016 001.jpg|thumb|The [[Regiment of Patricians]] is one of several units in the [[Argentine Army]] whose full dress uniform dates back to the 19th century.]] \nIn the [[Armed Forces of the Argentine Republic]], the [[Argentine Federal Police]], Argentine National Gendarmrie and Naval Prefecture, dress uniforms are worn during military and civil occasions, especially for the [[military band]]s and [[colour guard]]s.

Founded as a [[military academy]], the institution was transformed into a state-sponsored civilian [[post-secondary education|post-secondary school]] in 1970, although still operated by the French [[Ministry of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\n====National Gendarmerie====\n[[File:Republican Guard Bastille Day 2013 Paris t110458.jpg|thumb|French [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] infantry in full dress uniform.]]\nThe [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] of the National Gendarmerie is the last unit to wear dress uniform as service uniform, as [[guard of honour]] detachments are required to wear it while on duty. The cavalry regiment wear a 19th-century [[dragoon]] uniform, with metal helmet and white riding trousers, while the infantry regiments use a high-collared traditional gendarmerie uniform. The officer cadets and the staff of [[\u00e9cole des officiers de la gendarmerie nationale]] also use uniforms whose styling dates back to the 19th century.\n\n===Indonesia===\n[[File:Gatot Nurmantyo.jpg|thumb|upright|Former [[Indonesian Army]] general [[Gatot Nurmantyo]] dressed in PDU I, the [[Indonesian Army]]'s equivalent to full dress uniform]]\nThe [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], [[Indonesian National Police]], and other uniformed institutions of the country have their own types of Dress uniforms known as \"PDU\", an abbreviation from ''Pakaian Dinas Upacara'' literally meaning \"ceremonial uniform\" in [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]]; worn during formal occasions and when attending ceremonies. The Dress uniform (PDU) of the National Armed Forces consists of several categories which are:\n{{col div}}\n*PDU I - ([[Service medal]]s and [[Brevet (military)|brevets]] attached)  \n*PDU IA - ([[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia#Star decorations|Order decorations]] attached and [[Sash#Honorific orders|honorary sash]] worn over for those who are entitled to wear it)\n*PDU II - ([[Mess dress uniform#Indonesia|Mess dress uniform]])\n*PDU IIA - (Mess dress uniform with order decorations attached)  \n*PDU III - ([[Service ribbons]] attached)\n*PDU IV - (Short sleeved, with no [[necktie]] worn).<ref>Indonesian National Armed Forces Commander decree, dated 16 Mei 2019, regarding the Uniform, Attributes, Medals, and Rank Insignia of the Indonesian Armed Forces</ref>\n{{col div end}}\nEach uniform category is worn for different purposes and for certain occasions. The \"PDU I\" and \"PDU IA\" are regarded as \"full dress uniforms\" which are worn for formal state occasions and when attending ceremonial events of high significance. The headdress worn for this uniform is a peaked cap for men and a crusher cap for women, and for officers from special forces, as well as the Military Police, may wear their respective berets. When wearing the Mess dress uniform, no headdress is worn.\n\nThe \"PDU III\" uniform is worn during receptions and/or during the welcoming ceremony of a visiting high ranking foreign guest ([[head of state]] or head of government). While the \"PDU IV\" uniform is worn for occasions such as: [[Change of Command]] ceremonies, attending a [[passing out parade]], and worn by [[Military justice|military judges]] in the court.<ref>[https://dokumen.tips/documents/penggunaan-kelengkapan-dan-atribut-tni-ad.html Usage, Attributes, and Uniform of the Indonesian Army ]</ref> The mess dress uniform is basically the same for the three branches of the armed forces.

These are similar in style to civilian business dress suits, or to the service dress uniforms worn by the British forces. The dress uniform includes a [[Blazer|blazer-type]] jacket, worn with a white shirt, and a tie. The ground forces uniform is dark green, with a single-breasted, three-buttoned jacket and tie of the same colour. Headgear worn is the beret. The air force uniform is of the same design, but medium blue. The naval uniform has a darker blue, double-breasted, six-buttoned jacket, with gold-coloured rank insignia on the cuffs.<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/generals-get-a-makeover-with-new-dress-uniforms/ '' Dressed to kill: Generals get a makeover with new dress uniforms'', by Judah Ari Gross.

Some features of modern full dress uniform worn by both army and navy personnel date from those of the final Czarist period, prior to 1917. Most notably these include the blue-green shade of the modern army officer's parade and walking out uniform; the dark blue and white dress uniform still worn by sailors; and the ceremonial dress of the Kremlin Regiment.\n\n=== Sweden===\n{{Further|Swedish Military Uniform}}\n{{see also|Mess dress uniform#Full mess dress}}\n[[File:Swedish Royal Guard Bastille Day 2007.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Officer of the Life Company of the Swedish Lifeguards (2007)]]\nVarious forms of full dress uniforms were used by all regiments of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]] for ceremonial purposes until the 1960s, when they were generally discontinued, with the exception of the [[Svea Life Guards]] and the [[Life Guard Dragoons (Sweden)|Life Guard Dragoons]] still retaining colourful full dress uniforms of 19th century origin for ceremonial use. The remaining parts of the branches tend to apply a variant of the [[mess dress uniform]] called \"full mess uniform\" for formal wear purposes. White [[Spats (footwear)|spats]] and belts may also be added to their service dress uniforms for parades or certain ceremonial purposes.\n\n==== Swedish Army ====\nThere are three versions of full dress uniforms in use in the [[Swedish Army]] as of the present day, all belonging to the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]]. The infantry wears the dark blue uniform of the Svea Life Guards (1st Life Guards) with yellow collar, cuffs and piping which dates back to 1886. The [[Royal Swedish Army Band|Swedish Army Band]] wears the uniform of G\u00f6ta Life Guards (2nd Life Guards), with red collar, cuffs and piping. The headdress of the infantry is mainly the pickelhaube typed helmet in black leather from 1887. On state ceremonies, a white buffalo hair plume is added. [[Bearskin hat]]s dating from 1823 are still in use on special occasions.\n\nThe cavalry, including the [[Life Guards' Dragoon Music Corps|Swedish Cavalry Band]], wear the [[royal blue]] uniform of the Life Guard Dragoons (1st Cavalry) from 1895. Officers have a somewhat lighter colour on their full dress uniform compared to the troopers. The pickelhaube type helmet is made of nickel-plated steel with [[brass]] details and dates back to 1879. Changes were made in 1900 which transformed the helmet into a cuirassier style helmet. In 1928 with the amalgamation of the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Regiments, a helm wreath was added, together with a golden laurel wreath. Officers' gold chin straps with lion \"mascarons\" from the [[Life Regiment Dragoons]] (2nd Cavalry) were also authorised for the new composite regiment. On modern state occasions officers wear white buffalo hair plume while troopers wear a horse hair plumes of the same colour.\n\n==== Swedish Navy ====\n[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010 0c176 2128.jpg|thumb|Two officers in full dress on the royal barge ''Vasaorden''. In the [[Swedish Navy]], full dress is restricted to naval officers serving on the ''Vasaorden'']]\nIn the [[Swedish Navy]], only one ceremonial uniform is still in use. It is restricted to naval officers serving on the royal barge \"Vasaorden\" (Order of Vasa); a ship used only on rare ceremonial occasions. The uniform dates back to 1878.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n==== British Army ====\n{{Main|Uniforms of the British Army}}\nMost of the various uniforms worn by the [[British Army Uniforms|British Army]] today originate in former combat uniforms. At the start of the 19th century, British Army [[Regiment of Foot|Regiments of Foot]], trained to fight in the manner dictated by a weapon (the [[musket]]) which demanded close proximity to the target, were not concerned with camouflage, and wore red coats (scarlet for officers and sergeants). Rifle regiments, fighting as [[skirmishers]], and equipped with [[rifle]]s, were more concerned with concealment however, and wore dark green uniforms. [[Light Infantry]] regiments were also trained as skirmishers but wore red uniforms with green shakos. Whereas the infantry generally wore polished brass [[button]]s and white carrying equipment, the Rifles wore black.\n[[File:British old infantry uniforms.jpg|thumb|Infantry uniforms of the [[British Army]], from 1750\u20131835. Full dress uniforms in the British Army originate from former combat uniforms.]]\nHeavy [[dragoon]]s and [[Royal Engineers]] wore red (or later scarlet) coats. Most of the remainder of the British Army, however, including the [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]], [[hussar]]s, all but one [[lancer]] regiment, and various support elements wore dark blue uniforms{{cn|date=February 2020}}. These varied greatly in detail according to the arm of service or in many cases the individual regiment. [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Reserve]] units were for the most part distinguished by having silver (rather than gold-coloured) lace, buttons and accoutrements in full dress. From the [[Crimean War]] on, a narrow red stripe (piping) down the outside of each trouser leg was common to all red coated infantry units. Cavalry however wore stripes of regimental colour (white, yellow, blue/grey etc.) on their riding breeches. Scottish [[:Category:Highland regiments|Highland regiments]] did not wear trousers, favouring the kilt, and Scottish Lowland regiments adopted tartan [[trews]]. All [[Scottish regiment]]s wore [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] of distinctive cut instead of the tunics of English, Irish and Welsh units.\n\nFull dress headwear varied (both from regiment to regiment, and over time as influenced by military fashion): bearskins were worn by the Foot Guards, the [[2nd Dragoons (Royal Scots Greys)]] and (in a different form) by Fusiliers. Plumed helmets were worn by the Dragoons (except 2nd), Dragoon Guards and the Household Cavalry. Hussars wore their distinctive [[Busby (military headdress)|busby]], which also came to be adopted by the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers and certain other Corps; it was also worn in a different form by Rifle regiments. The Lancers had their [[chapka]]. Infantry of the line often wore shakos (later supplanted by the 'home service helmet'), as did others; though Scots and Irish regiments tended to have their own distinctive full-dress headwear. General officers and staff officers usually wore plumed [[cocked hat]]s in full dress, as did regimental staff officers and those of some support services. In hotter climates, for all of the above, a white [[pith helmet]] was often substituted.\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|thumb|left|The rise of [[rifle]]s and [[smokeless powder]] led to the adoption of [[khaki]] uniforms in the field, with blue, scarlet, and rifle green tunics relegated to ceremonial/parade use.]]\nBeginning with the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, the British Army began adopting light [[khaki]] uniforms for [[Tropical]] service that was first introduced in 1848 with the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]] in India.<ref>\"Khaki Uniform 1848\u201349: First Introduction by Lumsden and Hodson\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research; JSAHR 82 (Winter 2004); pp 341\u2013347</ref> This innovation arose from experience fighting irregular forces in India, for example on the Indian North-West Frontier and during the [[Indian Mutiny]], and in Africa during the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], as well as the invention of [[smokeless gunpowder]] and the increasing effectiveness and usage of rifles. In 1902 a darker shade of ''[[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]'' (SD) was adopted for field and ordinary use in Britain itself.  The scarlet, blue and rifle green uniforms were retained for wear as full dress on parade and \"walking-out dress\" when off duty and out of barracks. As worn between 1902 and 1914 by all non-commissioned ranks, walking-out dress was essentially the same as review order, except that a peaked cap or glengarry was worn instead of the full dress headdress and overalls (strapped trousers) were substituted for cavalry breeches.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, pages=236 & 237, \"Military Uniforms of Britain and the Empire\", Sphere Books Ltd, 1972</ref>\n\nWhen khaki web carrying equipment was introduced, the earlier, white or black leather carrying equipment was retained for wear with the dress uniform. As with the earlier uniforms, the officers' uniforms differed in quality and detail from those worn by the [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]]. Officers purchased their own dress uniforms from regimentally approved [[tailor]]s while other ranks were issued all orders of dress from government stocks.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 all full dress and other coloured uniforms ceased to be worn by the British Army. After 1919 they were restored to the [[Household Cavalry]] and Foot Guard for ceremonial purposes but not to the bulk of the army. Officers were authorised to wear full dress for certain special occasions such as Court levees (formal presentations to the Monarch) and it was customary to wear these uniforms at social functions such as weddings. By 1928 bands were wearing full dress on occasions where they were not parading with the remainder of the regiment (who had only khaki service dress). The pre-1914 dress uniforms were still held in store and occasionally reappeared for historic displays. However, there was no serious attempt to make them general issue again, primarily for reasons of expense.  When (khaki) Battle Dress (BD) uniforms, which had a short ''blouse'' instead of a tunic, were adopted immediately before the Second World War, the older khaki Service Dress became a smart uniform for wear on the streets, and on moderately formal occasions.\n\nAfter World War II the coloured, full dress uniforms were again reintroduced for ceremonial occasions by the [[Brigade of Guards]] and to a limited extent by regimental bands. Officers (and later senior non-commissioned officers) resumed wearing [[mess uniform]]s in traditional colours from about 1956 on. These are still worn, although regimental  amalgamations have led to numerous changes from the pre-war models.\n[[File:The Band of The Royal Regiment of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scottish regiment]]s retain a number of historical elements in their uniform, including their [[kilt]]s and [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]]s]]\nWith limited exceptions, the unique regimental full dress uniforms finally disappeared after 1939; today they are only generally worn, on ceremonial occasions, by the Bands and [[Corps of Drums]], by certain representatives on parade (e.g. some regimental [[Pioneer Sergeant|Pioneers]], or those forming a guard of honour) and by the regiments of the [[Household Division]].  In most regiments they were replaced by a generic dark blue uniform known as No 1 Dress. This dated back to plain \"patrol\" uniforms worn by officers before 1914 as an informal \"undress\" uniform. An early version had been worn by some units in the 1937 [[coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] but had not been made general issue at the time. In the form adopted after World War II, most regiments were distinguished only by coloured piping on the shoulder straps, coloured hat bands, buttons and badges. However Scottish regiments retained their kilts or trews as well as the distinctive doublets (in \"piper green\" or dark blue) of the former scarlet uniform.\n\nRifles regiments had dark green uniforms and cavalry retained a number of special features such as the crimson trousers of the [[11th Hussars]] or the quartered caps of lancer regiments.  A white, lightweight tunic (No 3 Dress) was also authorised for use in the [[tropics]], or during the summer months in warmer temperate climates (such as [[Bermuda Garrison|Bermuda]]). The blue \"home service\" helmets were not worn as part of the No 1 dress uniform, except by members of some bands or corps of drums which retained their old full dress uniforms, at regimental expense. English Rifle regiments were amalgamated into the [[Royal Green Jackets]], which continued to wear a dark green dress uniform, and black buttons and belts. Recent changes have brought the [[Royal Green Jackets]] and [[The Light Infantry]] together into a single regiment [[The Rifles]], which continues to wear dark green.\n[[File:Waterloo Band of The Rifles.jpg|thumb|The Waterloo Band of [[The Rifles]] in full dress. The Rifles continue to use [[rifle green]] in their full dress uniform.]]\nBerets were introduced initially into the [[Royal Tank Corps]] in the First World War and their use became more widespread in the British Army during and after the Second World War to replace side caps for wear with combat uniforms when protective headgear was not being worn. Originally, khaki was the standard colour for all units, but specialist units adopted coloured berets to distinguish themselves. For example, [[airborne forces]] adopted a [[Maroon (color)|maroon]]. This has since been adopted by many other parachute units around the world. The [[British Commandos|Commandos]] adopted a [[green beret]]. The [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) initially adopted a white beret quickly changing this to a [[beige]] or sand coloured one.  From 1944 they wore the Maroon airborne forces beret but the beige beret was re-adopted following the re-formation of the Regular SAS in Malaya.\nKhaki was replaced as a generic colour for berets after the war by dark blue, and this is the colour worn by those units not authorised to use a distinctively coloured beret.\n\nA peaked cap, with a coloured hat band, is intended to be worn with the No 1 Dress uniform, berets are the most common form of headdress seen with other orders of dress and are worn in No1 and 2 dress by some Regiments and Corps. \n\nThe blue or green No 1 Dress was never universally adopted after its initial introduction in 1947. The reason was mainly one of economy, although it was sometimes criticised as being too similar to police and other civilian uniforms \u2013 lacking the immediately recognisable military status of both scarlet and khaki. Khaki No 2 dress being the most usual order of dress for parades and formal occasions.\n[[File:Inspection-New-Colours.JPG|thumb|Officer cadets at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in full dress.]]\nAs noted above, the practice of issuing other ranks in line regiments with full sets of both service dress and dress uniforms effectively ended in 1914 and was never completely returned to. Today, with the exceptions noted above, full dress or No 1 Dress uniforms are only held in limited quantities as common stock, and issued only to detachments on occasional special ceremonial occasions. Practices do however vary between units and historic items of uniform are more likely to appear where tradition is particularly strong. As an example, the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] wore scarlet and blue \"review order\" uniforms until World War I, substituted khaki service dress for parade from 1919 to 1939  and now holds dark blue No 1 dress uniforms for the use of its cadets. The [[Royal Military Police]] retain the latter order of dress for general issue{{cn|date=February 2020}}.\n\n==== Royal Air Force ====\n{{See also|Uniforms of the Royal Air Force}}\n[[File:Sir Philip Game.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Air Vice-Marshal]] [[Philip Game]] in full dress, c. 1930. At the time, the [[Royal Air Force]]'s full dress included headgear that resembled helmets used in [[World War I]].]]\nHistorically, the [[Royal Air Force]] regulations permitted the wearing of a full dress uniform in both home and warm-weather variants. Although the home wear version of full dress is no longer worn (except in a modified form by RAF bandsmen),<ref>[http://www.britairforce.com/imagepages/raf_uniform_music.htm]</ref> the tropical full ceremonial dress continues to be authorised.\n\nThe temperate full dress uniform was introduced in April 1920. It consisted of a single-breasted jacket in blue-grey with a stand-up collar. Rank was indicated in gold braid on the lower sleeve and white gloves were worn. As with the British Army after 1914, full dress was not general issue during the inter-War period, but was authorized for wear by specific categories such as bandsmen and commissioned officers. The latter generally wore full dress only for infrequent occasions such as attendance at court [[levees]] and social functions such as weddings. Military attaches and royal [[aides de camp]] were amongst the few serving officers who might have regular occasions to wear full dress.\n\nInitially the full dress uniform was worn with the service dress cap. However, in 1921 a new form of head-dress was introduced. It was designed to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull cap trimmed with black rabbit fur. The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected to an RAF badge. This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.\n\n[[Group Captain]] the Duke of York (later [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]) wore RAF full dress at his wedding to Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923. The Duke wore or carried the full dress headgear rather than the service dress cap.\n\n====Royal Navy====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the Royal Navy}}\n[[File:Vaspw.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vice Admiral]] [[Philip Watson]] in ceremonial day dress. Introduced in 1960, ceremonial day dress is a variant of the [[Royal Navy]]'s full dress uniform that was taken out of service in 1956.]]\nSince the mid-eighteenth century, when naval uniforms were introduced, Flag Officers had different full-dress and undress versions, the latter being worn from day to day, the former only for formal occasions. By the late nineteenth century, an officer's full dress uniform consisted of a navy double-breasted tailcoat with white facings edged in gold (on the collar and cuff-slashes), gold lace (indicating rank) on the cuffs, epaulettes, sword and sword-belt, worn with gold-laced trousers and a cocked hat. This order of uniform lasted through the first half of the twentieth century, and was worn by Prince Philip at the Coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1956, however, it was abolished, leaving No. 1 uniform as the most formal order of dress. Subsequently, in 1960, full dress uniform was reintroduced in the form of [[Royal Navy uniform#Ceremonial Day Dress|Ceremonial Day Dress]]. Worn only by limited categories of senior officers this is very similar to the old full dress, but without fringed epaulettes and slashes, and worn with a peaked cap.\n\n====Civilian organisations====\nThe formal uniforms used by police forces were until the late 20th century mostly the same as the uniforms worn on ordinary duties but sometimes with various embellishments. The introduction of newer uniforms deliberately designed as workwear has left the older styles mainly used for ceremonial or formal purposes. The general formal style is a black jacket and trousers with a white shirt and a [[custodian helmet]] or peaked cap. A particular variation is that used by mounted police in Merseyside which can be observed when they escort the winner of the annual Grand National horse race at Aintree; this consists of the traditional ''Custodian helmet'' with an added white plume and silvered chinstrap; along with the style of tunic it bears more resemblance to a late 19th/early 20th century police uniform.\n\n=== United States ===\n====U.S. Air Force====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Air Force}}\nIn the mid-1980s, \"ceremonial blue\" uniform and \"ceremonial white\" uniform were introduced in the [[United States Air Force]].

It is the only uniform of the United States military to use all of the colours of the nation's flag and incorporates button designs which are the oldest military insignia still in use in the United States Armed Forces to this day.\n[[File:Plate IV, Enlisted Blue Dress Uniforms - U.S. Marine Corps Uniforms 1983 (1984), by Donna J. Neary.jpg|thumb|Enlisted marines dressed in Blue Dress Uniforms. From left to right: \"B\", \"B\", \"A\", \"D\", and \"C\".]]\nThe various designations used in Dress Blue include:\n* Dress Blue \"A\" has a long sleeve choker-collar midnight blue outer blouse, white barracks cover, with all [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|medals]] and service ribbons. Enlisted coats have a red trim and more buttons down the middle of the coat than officers.\n* Dress Blue \"B\" is the same as \"A\", but service ribbons and marksmanship [[Badges of the United States Marine Corps|badges]] are worn instead of medals. Dress Blue \"A\" (with medals worn) is strictly reserved for official ceremonies, while Dress Blue \"B\" may be worn on leave or liberty.\n* Dress Blue \"C\" is the dress blue uniform worn with the long sleeve khaki shirt (without coat). Service ribbons and badges may be worn.\n* Dress Blue \"D\" is the dress blue uniform worn with the short sleeve khaki shirt (without coat). Service ribbons and badges may be worn\n\nAll the blue uniforms have the same trousers, cover, and black shoes, with the exception of general officers who wear dark blue trousers in the same colour as the coat. Officers, [[Staff Noncommissioned Officer]]s, and [[non-commissioned officer|Noncommissioned Officer]]s wear [[blood stripe]]s on their trousers. Blood stripes are 1.25\" in width for NCOs and SNCOs, 1.5\" for officers, and 2\" for general officers.\n\nA sword may be worn when the individual is in command of troops in formation\u2014the [[Mameluke sword]] for officers, the [[Marine Noncommissioned Officers' Sword, 1859-Present|NCO sword]] for NCOs and SNCOs. When wearing the sword and Dress Blue coat, officers wear the [[Sam Browne belt]]. For enlisted, the sword is worn with a white waistbelt and brass buckle when wearing the Dress Blue coat. The Marine Corps is the only branch of the United States military which regularly allows NCOs to carry a sword.  For enlisted Marines, they earn the right to carry the NCO sword  and wear the scarlet blood stripe on their blue trousers when they achieve the rank of Corporal.\n[[File:United States Marine Corps Mounted Color Guard (32229627435).jpg|left|thumb|Dress uniform for the Marine Corps Mounted Colour Guard consists of a blue dress coat, white [[breeches]], and polished knee-high boots.]]\nMembers of the [[United States Marine Corps Band]], and the [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]] are authorized different dress uniforms, known as Red-Dress (a scarlet blouse with a blue trim). Before 1998, certain ceremonial Marine units, such as the [[Silent Drill Platoon]], wore a blue/white dress uniform in which white trousers were substituted for blue while performing ceremonial functions. The blue/white version is now an authorized summer uniform for officers, SNCOs, and on certain functions, NCOs. The Marine Corps Mounted Colour Guard currently wears the blue dress coat with white riding breeches and polished black knee-high riding boots<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanders|first=Denise|title=The magic of the 125th Tournament of Roses Parade|url=http://darkroom.baltimoresun.com/2014/01/the-magic-of-the-125th-tournament-of-roses-parade/#15|publisher=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=2 January 2014}}</ref> although in the past they have worn blue riding breeches with the red blood stripe.<ref>{{cite web|last=U.S. Bureau of Land Management|title=Wild Horse & Burro Program and the United States Marine Corps Color Guard|url=http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/prog/wild_horse_and_burro/Color_Guard.print.html|publisher=U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIORBUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103063241/http://www.blm.gov/ca/st/en/prog/wild_horse_and_burro/Color_Guard.print.html|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAnother uniform, the obsolete Dress White uniform, was a white version of the standard dress coat and trousers, was authorized only for officers, and resembled the Navy's Officer/CPO dress whites. No blood stripes were authorized, and white shoes were worn. This uniform was superseded by the Blue/White Dress uniform in 2000.\n\n==== U.S. Navy ====\n{{Further|Uniforms of the United States Navy}}\nThe Dress White uniform consists of a stand-collar white tunic, white trousers, and white dress shoes. Rank for officers is displayed on [[shoulder marks]] for males and on the sleeve cuffs for females, while CPO rank insignia is worn on the collar for both sexes. Service dress white includes service ribbons, whereas full dress white includes service ribbons and medals. This uniform is informally called \"Chokers\", due to the stand-collar.\n[[File:US Navy 091002-N-3442D-001 Members of the U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stand at parade rest before the start of the retirement ceremony for Rear Adm. Jon W. Bayless Jr. and Rear Adm. Edward.jpg|thumb|Enlisted sailors of the [[United States Navy]] in Full Dress Whites during a retirement ceremony.]]\nThe Dress Blue uniform consists of black shoes, navy blue (black in appearance) coat and trousers, a white shirt and either a [[Windsor knot|Windsor]] or formal bowtie. As with the white uniforms, only service ribbons are worn with Service Dress Blue, while service ribbons and medals are worn with Full Dress Blue. Depending on the occasion, officers may also wear [[sword]]s with either Full Dress White or Blue. Both the white and blue uniforms are worn with the distinctive peaked cap with white cover.\n\nNaval enlisted personnel ranked [[Petty Officer First Class]], E-6, and below also have seasonal uniforms. The dress white and blue uniforms are both of the traditional \"[[sailor suit]]\" or [[Cracker Jack|crackerjack]] type for men, and women wear the same as summertime dress white uniform. It consists of a pullover shirt, called a [[Sweater|jumper]], with a V-neck going to a square collar flap, a black [[neckerchief]], and bell-bottomed trousers. The white uniform is worn with a white belt and silver buckle, and the sleeves come down to the middle of the hand. The blue uniform features the thirteen button trousers, and has three rows of white piping on the collar and cuffs. Women wear a uniform similar to female officers and Chiefs, but with silver buttons, and a cover device with a spread eagle and \"USN\".\n\n====U.S. Coast Guard====\nBefore 1972, U.S. Coast Guard personnel generally wore the same uniforms as the U.S. Navy but with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, primarily distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and differentiated uniform buttons on dress uniforms.\n[[File:Coast Guard Full Dress Blue uniform.jpg|thumb|Members of the [[United States Coast Guard]] in Full Dress Blue during a change of command ceremony at [[Coast Guard Base Kodiak]].]]\nPresently, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains two full dress uniforms, full dress blue, and full dress white.<ref name=uscg/> Full dress blue is worn during change of command ceremonies, parades, and reviews when special honours are being paid, including state visits.<ref name=uscg/> The full dress blue uniforms are similar to the U.S. Coast Guard's service dress blue \"Alpha,\" except that it is worn with a full-size medals instead of ribbons. Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and a white belt and glove may be required.\n\nFull Dress White is worn for similar occasions by officers of the U.S. Coast Guard during the summer, or when in tropical environments.<ref name=uscg/> The Dress White uniform is slightly different depending on the gender; with men wearing a high stand-collared white tunic, white trousers, and white shoes, while women wear a uniform similar to the dress blue uniform but with a white coat and skirt or trousers. Both genders wear shoulder boards rather than sleeve stripes, as well as medals, combination cover, and sword. The uniform is nearly identical to the U.S. Navy's Full Dress Whites, but the buttons and combination cover device are Coast Guard specific.\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] maintains two different styles of parade dress uniforms. Both variants include a black blouse, with banded collars and double row of buttons, and a white peaked hat. However, Full Dress Blue A, uses white trousers, whereas Full Dress Blue B uses black trousers.\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nWithin the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] dress uniforms are commonplace within its services.\n\nThe Presidential Honor Guard Brigade wears dress uniforms similar to those used by the Hussar troop raised by Simon Bolivar in 1816. It is of a red tunic with gold buttons and black pants, belt and a black (formerly brown) busby hat, plus epaulettes worn by officers. The Caracas Battalion of the Ministry of Defence wears a light blue uniform with white buttons, black pants, a belt, boots or black shoes and the red beret while the Daniel O'Leary Battalion of the Army Headquarters wears an identical uniform but with the dark blue beret.\n\n==Full dress uniform by non-directly military organisations==\n===St John Ambulance===\n{{further|Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)}}\n[[File:SJAM Parade1.jpg|thumb|Individuals leading a group of [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia]] (SJAM) volunteers wearing SJAM's ceremonial uniform.]]\n[[St John Ambulance]] is a volunteer group of affiliated organisations in 42 countries, which aims to teach and provide [[first aid]], and [[emergency medical services]]. The organisation uses a number of uniforms, including a ceremonial one. The affiliated national organisations do not share a standardized ceremonial uniform, known as formal uniform or dress uniform depending on the country.\n\nThe uniform of St John Ambulance in [[St. John Ambulance Canada|Canada]], [[St John Ambulance in England|England]], [[St John Ambulance Ireland|Ireland]], and [[St John Ambulance in Wales|Wales]] was derived from the uniforms of London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]]; using similar jackets and trousers with different buttons, badges, and a cap with a white band and belt-mounted items relevant to first-aid work. Conversely, the ceremonial uniform for St John Ambulance in [[St John Ambulance of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[St John Singapore]] uses a white tunic and black trousers; derived from the British Army's warm weather ceremonial uniform. Generally, the organisation's ceremonial uniform is not used for daily medical and first-aid work, with the various national St John Ambulance organisations issuing a variety of occupational uniforms.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Military uniform]]\n**[[Mess dress uniform]]\n**[[Service dress uniform]]\n**[[Combat uniform]]\n* [[Formal wear]]\n** [[Morning dress]]\n** [[White tie]]\n** [[Ceremonial dress]]\n** [[Religious clothing]]\n** [[Folk costume]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|Full dress uniforms}}\n\n{{Clothing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dress Uniform}}\n[[Category:Military uniforms]]\n[[Category:Formal wear]]\n[[Category:Uniforms]]\n", "name_user": "RedRumRomanus", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_dress_uniform"}

A [[monarchy]] temporarily controlled by two or more people is, however, usually distinguished as a [[coregency]].\n\nCorule is one of the oldest forms of government. Historical examples include the [[Pandyan dynasty]] of [[Tamilakam]],  [[Sparta]]'s [[Kings of Sparta|joint kingdom]], the [[Roman Republic]]'s [[Roman consul|consuls]], [[ancient Carthage|Carthage]]'s [[shophet|Judges]], and several ancient [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies. Systems of inheritance that often led to corule in [[Germanic kingship|Germanic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] monarchies may be included as well, as may the dual occupants of the ranks of the [[Inca Empire]]. Modern examples of diarchies are [[Andorra]], whose princes are the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] in [[Catalonia]]; [[San Marino]], whose republic is led by two [[Captains Regent]]; and [[Eswatini]], where sovereignty rests jointly in the king and his mother.\n\n==Formal use==\n=== Current diarchies ===\n==== Andorra ====\n{{main|Government of Andorra|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}\n\n[[Andorra]] is a parliamentary co-[[principality]]. Its princes are (''[[ex officio]]'') the [[France|French]] [[president of France|president]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell|bishop]] of [[diocese of Urgell|Urgell]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Since 1962, the French president has been [[French presidential election|elected]] by [[universal suffrage]] within [[France]]. The bishop of the diocese of Urgell is appointed by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]].\n\n==== Bhutan ====\n{{main|Government of Bhutan|List of kings of Bhutan}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Bhutan|2008 Constitution]] affirms [[Bhutan]]'s commitment to a [[Tibetan dual system of government|traditional dual government]] sharing power between the [[Druk Gyalpo]] (\"King\") and the Buddhist religious authorities led by the [[Je Khenpo]]. In practice, however, the religious leaders function more as advisors to the kings than as corulers.\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nUnder the terms of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] intended to end [[The Troubles|conflict]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] and [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|deputy First Minister]] serve as joint heads of the area's [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]]. Both positions exercise identical executive powers; however they are not heads of state.\n\n==== San Marino ====\n{{main|Government of San Marino|List of Captains Regent of San Marino}}\n\nThe [[captains regent]] ({{lang-it|Capitani Reggenti}}) of [[San Marino]] are elected every six months by the Marinese parliament, the Grand and General Council.  They serve as heads of state and government and are normally chosen from opposing parties.\n\n===Historical diarchies===\n====Sparta====\n{{main|Government of ancient Sparta|List of Spartan kings}}\n\nThe office of king in [[ancient Sparta]] was divided between two kings from separate dynasties, each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.\n\n====Roman Republic====\n{{main|List of Roman consuls|Duumviri}}\n\nFollowing the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy]], the Romans established an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[Roman Republic]] which divided [[imperium|supreme executive power]] ({{lang-la|imperium}}) between two [[Roman consul|consuls]], both elected each year and each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.\n\nThe historical [[duumviri]] were not rulers but magistrates, performing various judicial, religious, or public functions.\n\n====Hungary====\nThe [[Hungarians]] originally possessed a system of dual kingship, with religious authority vested in the [[kende]] and military authority vested in the [[gyula (title)|war-chief]] (''{{lang|hu|gyula}}''). It is believed that when the kende [[Kursz\u00e1n]] was killed {{c.|904}} a little after the arrival of the Hungarians in [[Pannonia]], his role was usurped by the war-chief [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d]], establishing the Hungarian monarchy. It is not known with certainty whether \u00c1rp\u00e1d was originally the kende or the gyula.\n\n====Medieval Europe====\n{{main|Par\u00e9age}}\n\nA [[par\u00e9age]] was a [[feudalism|feudal]] treaty recognizing the \"[[pari passu|equal footing]]\" ({{lang-la|pari passu}}) of two sovereigns over a territory. The most famous such arrangement was the [[Par\u00e9age of Andorra 1278|1278 treaty]] that established modern [[Andorra]]. Others include [[Maastricht]], which was shared by the [[Duke of Brabant]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]]. After the establishment of the [[Dutch Republic]], it became a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of Li\u00e8ge and the United Provinces, which administered it through the [[States General of the Netherlands]] until 1794.\n\n====Japan====\nDuring [[Japan]]'s [[Sh\u014dgun|shogunate]], the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] was notionally a supreme spiritual and temporal lord who delegated authority for joint rule to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. In practice, the ''sh\u014dguns''{{'}} power was so complete that they are usually considered ''[[de facto]]'' monarchs rather than [[viceroy]]s or corulers.\n\n====Tibet====\n{{main|Tibetan dual system of government|List of Dalai Lamas}}\n\nBetween 1642 and 1751, political power in [[Tibet]] was shared between the [[5th Dalai Lama|5th]], [[6th Dalai Lama|6th]], and [[7th Dalai Lama|7th Dalai Lamas]] who headed the realm's Buddhist [[state religion]] and various secular rulers known as desis. The growing power of the desis caused the 7th Dalai Lama to abolish the post and replace it with a council known as the [[Kashag]], permitting him to consolidate his authority over the realm. A similar system arose in [[Bhutan]], with the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck]] [[penlop|governor]] (''penlop'') of [[Trongsa]] becoming the [[Druk Desi]] and [[Druk Gyalpo]] in 1907. In contrast to Tibet, the dynasty eventually consolidated its power and now rules as the kings of Bhutan.\n\n====Canada ====\n{{main|Government of the Province of Canada|List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada}}\n\nThe [[British colonial empire|colonial]] [[Province of Canada]] was usually governed by two [[joint premiers of the province of Canada|joint premiers]] from 1841 to 1867. Usually, one was chosen from the English-speaking [[Canada West]] and the other one from the French-speaking [[Canada East]].\n\n====Russia====\n{{main|February Revolution|October Revolution|Dual Power in Russia}}\n\nBetween the [[February Revolution]] in March 1917 and the [[October Revolution]] in November, political power in Russia was divided between the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and the [[Petrograd Soviet]], a condition described by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as \"Dual Power\". He elaborated the situation into a [[dual power (Communism)|dual-power doctrine]], whereby [[Communist]]s collaborated with and then supplanted existing bourgeois forms of government.\n\n====India====\nNamed as the [[Secretary of State for India|India Secretary]] for the [[Lloyd George ministry]], [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]] made the \"[[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Grand Declaration]]\" on 20 August 1917 that British policy would henceforth be \"increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions\". Montagu and [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viscount Chelmsford]], the [[Governor-General of India]], then made an extensive tour of the subcontinent in 1917 and 1918. The [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Montague\u2013Chelmsford Report]]'s recommendations formed the basis for the [[Government of India Act 1919]] that established \"diarchy\" in [[British India]]. \n\nUnder that act, the executive was to be headed by a governor appointed by the Secretary of State, who could consult the Governor General. The governor was responsible to the Secretary of State for acts of omission and commission. He was to maintain law and order in the province and ensure that the provincial administration worked smoothly. In respect of transferred subjects, he was to be assisted by his ministers whereas reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor General and his executive council.\n\nThe members of the Executive Council were to be appointed by Secretary of State and were responsible to him in all matters. There were certain matters that he was to administer at his own discretion, in which he was responsible to the Secretary of State. Each councillor was to remain in office for a period of four years. Their salaries and service conditions were not subject to the vote of provincial legislature. All decisions in the council were to be taken by a majority of votes, the Governor being able to break ties.\n\n====Samoa====\n{{main|Politics of Samoa}}\n\nDuring the establishment of the modern state of [[Samoa]] in 1962, power was shared between the two chiefs [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] and [[Tupua Tamasese Mea\u02bbole]]. Mea\u02bbole died the next year, after which the country functioned as a monarchy until the death of Tanumafili and a republic thereafter.\n\n==Informal use==\n\n===Bureaucracy===\nShared power arrangements within a modern bureaucracy may also be known as a \"diarchy\" or \"duumvirate\". Examples include the joint authority of the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] and the Secretary of the Department of Defence over the [[Australian Defence Organisation]].\n\n===Influential outsiders===\n{{main|\u00c9minence grise}}\n\nThe status of monarchs is sometimes impugned by accusations of corule when an advisor, family member, lover, or friend appears to have taken too great a hand in government. [[L\u00fc Buwei]] in Chinese history and [[Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc du Tremblay]] in France are famous examples of \"[[\u00e9minence grise|\u00e9minences grises]]\" who controlled much of their countries' policies. In British history, [[George VI]]'s reign was mocked as a \"split-level [[matriarchy]] in pants\" owing to the supposed influence of his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and his wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref>{{citation |contribution=A Revolution in the Nursery |contribution-url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1389360/A-revolution-in-the-nursery.html |title=The Telegraph |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ }}.</ref>\n\n===Informally shared power===\nOwing to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] notions of [[filial piety]], Chinese and Japanese emperors were sometimes able to 'retire' but continue to exert great influence over state policy. In [[Indonesia]], [[Sukarno]] and his vice president [[Mohammad Hatta]] were nicknamed the Duumvirate (''{{lang|id|Dwitunggal}}''), with Sukarno setting government policy and rallying support and Hatta managing day-to-day administration. More recently, the great influence of [[Vladimir Putin]] over his successor [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was considered a duumvirate{{sfnp|Martin|2009}} or tandemocracy{{sfnp|Hale & al.|2009}} until Putin's resumption of the office of president established him as the greater figure.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/daniil-kotsyubinsky/russian-politics-is-kudrin-cure-for-putin%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98tandem-malaise%E2%80%99 |contribution=Russian Politics: Is Kudrin the Cure for Putin\u2019s \u2018Tandem Malaise\u2019? |title=Open Democracy |accessdate=6 May 2012}}.</ref>\n\nWithin electoral politics, governments, coalitions and parties may sometimes have two fairly equal leaders, as with:\n\n* The temporary [[First Whitlam Ministry]] of 5\u201319 December 1972, composed of [[Gough Whitlam ]] and [[Lance Barnard]], which was nicknamed the \"duumvirate\".\n* Russel Norman and Metiria Turei as joint leaders of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]].\n\n===Religious leaders===\nIn addition to actual sharing of political power between religious and military leaders, as occurred in Tibet and Bhutan, the great [[soft power]] of a religious leader such as the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] over a devout country can sometimes be described as a form of diarchy or corule.\n\n===Traditional leaders===\nThe [[Eswatini|Kingdom of Eswatini]] is a diarchy in which the [[List of monarchs of Eswatini|King]] ([[Ngwenyama]]) rules in conjunction with his mother, the [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] ([[Ndlovukati]]) in their capacity as traditional rulers. Constitutionally, however, the King is the sole head of state, though it is often argued that the giving of authority wholesale to the royal male in this way is a neo-traditionalistic as opposed to truly traditional custom.{{Citation needed|reason=Consuls being diarchs|date=January 2020}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n* [[Umbar]], in the works of [[J.

A [[monarchy]] temporarily controlled by two or more people is, however, usually distinguished as a [[coregency]].\n\nCorule is one of the oldest forms of government. Historical examples include the [[Pandyan dynasty]] of [[Tamilakam]],  [[Sparta]]'s [[Kings of Sparta|joint kingdom]], the [[Roman Republic]]'s [[Roman consul|consuls]], [[ancient Carthage|Carthage]]'s [[shophet|Judges]], and several ancient [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies. Systems of inheritance that often led to corule in [[Germanic kingship|Germanic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] monarchies may be included as well, as may the dual occupants of the ranks of the [[Inca Empire]]. Modern examples of diarchies are [[Andorra]], whose princes are the [[President of France]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell|Bishop of Urgell]] in [[Catalonia]]; [[San Marino]], whose republic is led by two [[Captains Regent]]; and [[Eswatini]], where sovereignty rests jointly in the king and his mother.\n\n==Formal use==\n=== Current diarchies ===\n==== Andorra ====\n{{main|Government of Andorra|List of Co-Princes of Andorra}}\n\n[[Andorra]] is a parliamentary co-[[principality]]. Its princes are (''[[ex officio]]'') the [[France|French]] [[president of France|president]] and the [[Bishop of Urgell|bishop]] of [[diocese of Urgell|Urgell]] in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]. Since 1962, the French president has been [[French presidential election|elected]] by [[universal suffrage]] within [[France]]. The bishop of the diocese of Urgell is appointed by the [[Roman Catholic]] [[pope]].\n\n==== Bhutan ====\n{{main|Government of Bhutan|List of kings of Bhutan}}\n\nThe [[Constitution of Bhutan|2008 Constitution]] affirms [[Bhutan]]'s commitment to a [[Tibetan dual system of government|traditional dual government]] sharing power between the [[Druk Gyalpo]] (\"King\") and the Buddhist religious authorities led by the [[Je Khenpo]]. In practice, however, the religious leaders function more as advisors to the kings than as corulers.\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nUnder the terms of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] intended to end [[The Troubles|conflict]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the [[First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]] and [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|deputy First Minister]] serve as joint heads of the area's [[Northern Ireland Executive|executive]]. Both positions exercise identical executive powers; however they are not heads of state.\n\n==== San Marino ====\n{{main|Government of San Marino|List of Captains Regent of San Marino}}\n\nThe [[captains regent]] ({{lang-it|Capitani Reggenti}}) of [[San Marino]] are elected every six months by the Marinese parliament, the Grand and General Council.  They serve as heads of state and government and are normally chosen from opposing parties.\n\n===Historical diarchies===\n====Sparta====\n{{main|Government of ancient Sparta|List of Spartan kings}}\n\nThe office of king in [[ancient Sparta]] was divided between two kings from separate dynasties, each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.\n\n====Roman Republic====\n{{main|List of Roman consuls|Duumviri}}\n\nFollowing the [[overthrow of the Roman monarchy]], the Romans established an [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] [[Roman Republic]] which divided [[imperium|supreme executive power]] ({{lang-la|imperium}}) between two [[Roman consul|consuls]], both elected each year and each holding a [[veto]] over the other's actions.\n\nThe historical [[duumviri]] were not rulers but magistrates, performing various judicial, religious, or public functions.\n\n====Hungary====\nThe [[Hungarians]] originally possessed a system of dual kingship, with religious authority vested in the [[kende]] and military authority vested in the [[gyula (title)|war-chief]] (''{{lang|hu|gyula}}''). It is believed that when the kende [[Kursz\u00e1n]] was killed {{c.|904}} a little after the arrival of the Hungarians in [[Pannonia]], his role was usurped by the war-chief [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d]], establishing the Hungarian monarchy. It is not known with certainty whether \u00c1rp\u00e1d was originally the kende or the gyula.\n\n====Medieval Europe====\n{{main|Par\u00e9age}}\n\nA [[par\u00e9age]] was a [[feudalism|feudal]] treaty recognizing the \"[[pari passu|equal footing]]\" ({{lang-la|pari passu}}) of two sovereigns over a territory. The most famous such arrangement was the [[Par\u00e9age of Andorra 1278|1278 treaty]] that established modern [[Andorra]]. Others include [[Maastricht]], which was shared by the [[Duke of Brabant]] and the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]]. After the establishment of the [[Dutch Republic]], it became a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of Li\u00e8ge and the United Provinces, which administered it through the [[States General of the Netherlands]] until 1794.\n\n====Japan====\nDuring [[Japan]]'s [[Sh\u014dgun|shogunate]], the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] was notionally a supreme spiritual and temporal lord who delegated authority for joint rule to the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]''. In practice, the ''sh\u014dguns''{{'}} power was so complete that they are usually considered ''[[de facto]]'' monarchs rather than [[viceroy]]s or corulers.\n\n====Tibet====\n{{main|Tibetan dual system of government|List of Dalai Lamas}}\n\nBetween 1642 and 1751, political power in [[Tibet]] was shared between the [[5th Dalai Lama|5th]], [[6th Dalai Lama|6th]], and [[7th Dalai Lama|7th Dalai Lamas]] who headed the realm's Buddhist [[state religion]] and various secular rulers known as desis. The growing power of the desis caused the 7th Dalai Lama to abolish the post and replace it with a council known as the [[Kashag]], permitting him to consolidate his authority over the realm. A similar system arose in [[Bhutan]], with the [[House of Wangchuck|Wangchuck]] [[penlop|governor]] (''penlop'') of [[Trongsa]] becoming the [[Druk Desi]] and [[Druk Gyalpo]] in 1907. In contrast to Tibet, the dynasty eventually consolidated its power and now rules as the kings of Bhutan.\n\n====Canada ====\n{{main|Government of the Province of Canada|List of joint premiers of the Province of Canada}}\n\nThe [[British colonial empire|colonial]] [[Province of Canada]] was usually governed by two [[joint premiers of the province of Canada|joint premiers]] from 1841 to 1867. Usually, one was chosen from the English-speaking [[Canada West]] and the other one from the French-speaking [[Canada East]].\n\n====Russia====\n{{main|February Revolution|October Revolution|Dual Power in Russia}}\n\nBetween the [[February Revolution]] in March 1917 and the [[October Revolution]] in November, political power in Russia was divided between the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and the [[Petrograd Soviet]], a condition described by [[Vladimir Lenin]] as \"Dual Power\". He elaborated the situation into a [[dual power (Communism)|dual-power doctrine]], whereby [[Communist]]s collaborated with and then supplanted existing bourgeois forms of government.\n\n====India====\nNamed as the [[Secretary of State for India|India Secretary]] for the [[Lloyd George ministry]], [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]] made the \"[[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Grand Declaration]]\" on 20 August 1917 that British policy would henceforth be \"increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions\". Montagu and [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viscount Chelmsford]], the [[Governor-General of India]], then made an extensive tour of the subcontinent in 1917 and 1918. The [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms|Montague\u2013Chelmsford Report]]'s recommendations formed the basis for the [[Government of India Act 1919]] that established \"diarchy\" in [[British India]]. \n\nUnder that act, the executive was to be headed by a governor appointed by the Secretary of State, who could consult the Governor General. The governor was responsible to the Secretary of State for acts of omission and commission. He was to maintain law and order in the province and ensure that the provincial administration worked smoothly. In respect of transferred subjects, he was to be assisted by his ministers whereas reserved subjects were to be administered by the Governor General and his executive council.\n\nThe members of the Executive Council were to be appointed by Secretary of State and were responsible to him in all matters. There were certain matters that he was to administer at his own discretion, in which he was responsible to the Secretary of State. Each councillor was to remain in office for a period of four years. Their salaries and service conditions were not subject to the vote of provincial legislature. All decisions in the council were to be taken by a majority of votes, the Governor being able to break ties.\n\n====Samoa====\n{{main|Politics of Samoa}}\n\nDuring the establishment of the modern state of [[Samoa]] in 1962, power was shared between the two chiefs [[Malietoa Tanumafili II]] and [[Tupua Tamasese Mea\u02bbole]]. Mea\u02bbole died the next year, after which the country functioned as a monarchy until the death of Tanumafili and a republic thereafter.\n\n==Informal use==\n\n===Bureaucracy===\nShared power arrangements within a modern bureaucracy may also be known as a \"diarchy\" or \"duumvirate\". Examples include the joint authority of the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] and the Secretary of the Department of Defence over the [[Australian Defence Organisation]].\n\n===Influential outsiders===\n{{main|\u00c9minence grise}}\n\nThe status of monarchs is sometimes impugned by accusations of corule when an advisor, family member, lover, or friend appears to have taken too great a hand in government. [[L\u00fc Buwei]] in Chinese history and [[Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc du Tremblay]] in France are famous examples of \"[[\u00e9minence grise|\u00e9minences grises]]\" who controlled much of their countries' policies. In British history, [[George VI]]'s reign was mocked as a \"split-level [[matriarchy]] in pants\" owing to the supposed influence of his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] and his wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].<ref>{{citation |contribution=A Revolution in the Nursery |contribution-url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1389360/A-revolution-in-the-nursery.html |title=The Telegraph |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/ }}.</ref>\n\n===Informally shared power===\nOwing to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] notions of [[filial piety]], Chinese and Japanese emperors were sometimes able to 'retire' but continue to exert great influence over state policy. In [[Indonesia]], [[Sukarno]] and his vice president [[Mohammad Hatta]] were nicknamed the Duumvirate (''{{lang|id|Dwitunggal}}''), with Sukarno setting government policy and rallying support and Hatta managing day-to-day administration. More recently, the great influence of [[Vladimir Putin]] over his successor [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was considered a duumvirate{{sfnp|Martin|2009}} or tandemocracy{{sfnp|Hale & al.|2009}} until Putin's resumption of the office of president established him as the greater figure.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url = http://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/daniil-kotsyubinsky/russian-politics-is-kudrin-cure-for-putin%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98tandem-malaise%E2%80%99 |contribution=Russian Politics: Is Kudrin the Cure for Putin\u2019s \u2018Tandem Malaise\u2019? |title=Open Democracy |accessdate=6 May 2012}}.</ref>\n\nWithin electoral politics, governments, coalitions and parties may sometimes have two fairly equal leaders, as with:\n\n* The temporary [[First Whitlam Ministry]] of 5\u201319 December 1972, composed of [[Gough Whitlam ]] and [[Lance Barnard]], which was nicknamed the \"duumvirate\".\n* Russel Norman and Metiria Turei as joint leaders of the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]].\n\n===Religious leaders===\nIn addition to actual sharing of political power between religious and military leaders, as occurred in Tibet and Bhutan, the great [[soft power]] of a religious leader such as the [[Pope]] of the [[Catholic Church]] over a devout country can sometimes be described as a form of diarchy or corule.\n\n===Traditional leaders===\nThe [[Eswatini|Kingdom of Eswatini]] is a diarchy in which the [[List of monarchs of Eswatini|King]] ([[Ngwenyama]]) rules in conjunction with his mother, the [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] ([[Ndlovukati]]) in their capacity as traditional rulers. Constitutionally, however, the King is the sole head of state, though it is often argued that the giving of authority wholesale to the royal male in this way is a neo-traditionalistic as opposed to truly traditional custom.{{Citation needed|reason=Consuls being diarchs|date=January 2020}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n* [[Umbar]], in the works of [[J.

The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', was written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]].\n\nEarly poems in the [[Eurasia]]n continent evolved from folk songs such as the Chinese [[Classic of Poetry|''Shijing'']]; or from a need to retell oral epics, as with the [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit]] ''[[Vedas]]'', the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] ''[[Gathas]]'', and the [[Homer]]ic epics, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Ancient Greek attempts to define poetry, such as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']], focused on the uses of [[Speech communication|speech]] in [[rhetoric]], [[drama]], [[song]], and [[comedy]]. Later attempts concentrated on features such as [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[line (poetry)|verse form]], and [[rhyme]], and emphasized the aesthetics which distinguish poetry from more objectively-informative [[prosaic]] writing.\n\nPoetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretations of words, or to evoke [[emotion|emotive]] responses.

The use of [[ambiguity]], [[symbol]]ism, [[irony]], and other [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] elements of [[poetic diction]] often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations.

Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sch\u00fclter, Julia |title=Rhythmic Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2005 |pages=24, 304, 332}}</ref> Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yip, Moira |title=Tone |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-77314-0 |series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics |pages=1\u20134, 130}}</ref>\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}</ref> In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jorgens |first=Elise Bickford |title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597\u20131651 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7 |page=23}}</ref> [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]\nThe chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker-Jones |first=Arthur |title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58983-086-8 |pages=211\u201313}}</ref> Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bala Sundara Raman |first=L |last2=Ishwar, S |last3=Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth |year=2003 |title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry |journal=Tamil Internet |pages=128\u201336 |citeseerx=10.1.1.3.7738}}</ref>\n\n[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (\u5e73 ''p\u00edng'') tone and the oblique (\u4ec4 ''z\u00e8'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (\u4e0a ''sh\u00e1ng'') tone, the departing (\u53bb ''q\u00f9'') tone and the entering (\u5165 ''r\u00f9'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed constraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.\n\nThe formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=[[Bollingen Foundation]] |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 9\u201313]}}</ref>\n\n==== Metrical patterns ====\n[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) is mainly in [[anapestic tetrameter]].]]\n{{Main|Meter (poetry)}}\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=Bollingen Foundation |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 46\u201347]}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}</ref>\n* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}</ref>\n* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], \"[[To His Coy Mistress]]\"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')<ref name=\"tetra\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tetrameter.com |title=What is Tetrameter? |publisher=tetrameter.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic octameter]] ([[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"[[The Raven]]\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=60}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''; the Finnish national epic, ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)\n* {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}} ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Ph\u00e8dre]]'')<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=ED |url=https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame |title=Racine: Ph\u00e8dre |last2=Jondorf, G |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-39721-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame/page/32 32\u201334] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]\n{{Main|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.<ref name=kiparsky/>\n\n==== Rhyming schemes ====\n[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|''[[Divine Comedy]]'': [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] see God as a point of light.]]\n{{Main|Rhyme scheme}}\n\nIn many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplets]]. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]). Further, postmodern authors such as [[Ted Berrigan]] and [[John Berryman]] have challenged the traditional definitions of the sonnet form, rendering entire sequences of \"sonnets\" that often lack rhyme, a clear logical progression, or even a consistent count of fourteen lines.\n\n=== Shi ===\n[[File:Dufucalligraphy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Du Fu]], \"On Visiting the Temple of [[Laozi]]\"]]\n{{Main|Shi (poetry)}}\n\n''Shi'' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:\u8a69|\u8a69]]|s=[[wikt:\u8bd7|\u8bd7]]|p=sh\u012b|w=shih}}) Is the main type of [[Classical Chinese poetry]].<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

Among its other rules, the jintishi rules regulate the tonal variations within a poem, including the use of set patterns of the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]]. The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Faurot |first=Jeannette L |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 |title=Drinking with the moon |publisher=China Books & Periodicals |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yugen |date=1 June 2004 |title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse |journal=T'ang Studies |volume=2004 |issue=22 |pages=81\u2013125 |doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}</ref> One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schirokauer |first=Conrad |title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-15-505569-8 |edition=2nd |page=119}}</ref>\n\n=== Villanelle ===\n[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.

The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.

Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English usually obeys at least some formal conventions.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way.

Languages are often described as having timing set primarily by [[stress-timed language|accents]], [[syllable-timed language|syllables]], or [[mora-timed language|moras]], depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. [[Japanese Language|Japanese]] is a [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]-timed language. [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are called syllable-timed languages. Stress-timed languages include [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and, generally, [[German language|German]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sch\u00fclter, Julia |title=Rhythmic Grammar |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2005 |pages=24, 304, 332}}</ref> Varying [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch or tone. Some languages with a pitch accent are Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek. [[Tonal language]]s include Chinese, Vietnamese and most [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Subsaharan languages]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yip, Moira |title=Tone |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-521-77314-0 |series=Cambridge textbooks in linguistics |pages=1\u20134, 130}}</ref>\n\nMetrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called [[foot (prosody)|feet]] within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or [[elision|elided]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=12}}</ref> In the [[classical languages]], on the other hand, while the [[Meter (music)|metrical]] units are similar, [[vowel length]] rather than stresses define the meter.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jorgens |first=Elise Bickford |title=The well-tun'd word : musical interpretations of English poetry, 1597\u20131651 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8166-1029-7 |page=23}}</ref> [[Old English]] poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=75\u201376}}</ref>\n[[File:Marianne Moore 1935.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Marianne Moore]]]]\nThe chief device of ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Biblical poetry]], including many of the [[psalms]], was ''[[parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]'', a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to [[antiphon]]al or [[call and response (music)|call-and-response]] performance, which could also be reinforced by [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Walker-Jones |first=Arthur |title=Hebrew for biblical interpretation |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-58983-086-8 |pages=211\u201313}}</ref> Some classical poetry forms, such as [[Venpa]] of the [[Tamil language]], had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]]) which ensured a rhythm.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bala Sundara Raman |first=L |last2=Ishwar, S |last3=Kumar Ravindranath, Sanjeeth |year=2003 |title=Context Free Grammar for Natural Language Constructs: An implementation for Venpa Class of Tamil Poetry |journal=Tamil Internet |pages=128\u201336 |citeseerx=10.1.1.3.7738}}</ref>\n\n[[Shi (poetry)|Classical Chinese poetics]], based on the [[Four tones (Middle Chinese)|tone system of Middle Chinese]], recognized two kinds of tones: the level (\u5e73 ''p\u00edng'') tone and the oblique (\u4ec4 ''z\u00e8'') tones, a category consisting of the rising (\u4e0a ''sh\u00e1ng'') tone, the departing (\u53bb ''q\u00f9'') tone and the entering (\u5165 ''r\u00f9'') tone. Certain forms of poetry placed constraints on which syllables were required to be level and which oblique.\n\nThe formal patterns of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In the case of [[free verse]], rhythm is often organized based on looser units of [[Cadence (poetry)|cadence]] rather than a regular meter.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]] noted that overlaid on top of the regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of verse was a separate pattern of accents resulting from the natural pitch of the spoken words, and suggested that the term \"scud\" be used to distinguish an unaccented stress from an accented stress.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=[[Bollingen Foundation]] |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/9 9\u201313]}}</ref>\n\n==== Metrical patterns ====\n[[File:Lewis Carroll - Henry Holiday - Hunting of the Snark - Plate 6.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' (1876) is mainly in [[anapestic tetrameter]].]]\n{{Main|Meter (poetry)}}\n\nDifferent traditions and genres of poetry tend to use different meters, ranging from the Shakespearean [[iambic pentameter]] and the Homeric [[dactylic hexameter]] to the [[anapestic tetrameter]] used in many nursery rhymes. However, a number of variations to the established meter are common, both to provide emphasis or attention to a given foot or line and to avoid boring repetition. For example, the stress in a foot may be inverted, a [[caesura]] (or pause) may be added (sometimes in place of a foot or stress), or the final foot in a line may be given a [[Meter (poetry)|feminine ending]] to soften it or be replaced by a [[spondee]] to emphasize it and create a hard stop. Some patterns (such as iambic pentameter) tend to be fairly regular, while other patterns, such as dactylic hexameter, tend to be highly irregular.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=36\u201371}}</ref> Regularity can vary between language. In addition, different patterns often develop distinctively in different languages, so that, for example, [[iambic tetrameter]] in Russian will generally reflect a regularity in the use of accents to reinforce the meter, which does not occur, or occurs to a much lesser extent, in English.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Nabokov, Vladimir |url=https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 |title=Notes on Prosody |publisher=Bollingen Foundation |year=1964 |isbn=978-0-691-01760-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/notesonprosodyon0000nabo/page/46 46\u201347]}}</ref>\n[[File:Kiprensky Pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alexander Pushkin]]]]\nSome common metrical patterns, with notable examples of poets and poems who use them, include:\n* [[Iambic pentameter]] ([[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]''; [[William Shakespeare]], ''[[Shakespeare's Sonnets|Sonnets]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=206}}</ref>\n* [[Dactylic hexameter]] (Homer, ''[[Iliad]]''; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'')<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=63}}</ref>\n* [[Iambic tetrameter]] ([[Andrew Marvell]], \"[[To His Coy Mistress]]\"; [[Alexander Pushkin]], ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''; [[Robert Frost]], ''[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]'')<ref name=\"tetra\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tetrameter.com |title=What is Tetrameter? |publisher=tetrameter.com |access-date=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic octameter]] ([[Edgar Allan Poe]], \"[[The Raven]]\")<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|p=60}}</ref>\n* [[Trochaic tetrameter]] ([[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''; the Finnish national epic, ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', is also in trochaic tetrameter, the natural rhythm of Finnish and Estonian)\n* {{lang|fr|[[Alexandrin]]}} ([[Jean Racine]], ''[[Ph\u00e8dre]]'')<ref>{{Cite book |last=James |first=ED |url=https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame |title=Racine: Ph\u00e8dre |last2=Jondorf, G |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-521-39721-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/racinephdre00jame/page/32 32\u201334] |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n=== Rhyme, alliteration, assonance ===\n[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Old English]] [[epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is in [[alliterative]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]].]]\n{{Main|Rhyme|Alliterative verse|Assonance}}\n\nRhyme, alliteration, assonance and [[Literary consonance|consonance]] are ways of creating repetitive patterns of sound. They may be used as an independent structural element in a poem, to reinforce rhythmic patterns, or as an ornamental element.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=65}}</ref> They can also carry a meaning separate from the repetitive sound patterns created. For example, [[Chaucer]] used heavy alliteration to mock Old English verse and to paint a character as archaic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Osberg, Richard H |title=Essays on the art of Chaucer's Verse |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8153-2951-0 |editor-last=Gaylord, Alan T |pages=195\u2013228 |chapter='I kan nat geeste': Chaucer's Artful Alliteration}}</ref>\n\nRhyme consists of identical (\"hard-rhyme\") or similar (\"soft-rhyme\") sounds placed at the ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines (\"[[internal rhyme]]\"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word endings that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word endings adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Alighieri, Dante; Pinsky Robert (trans.) |url=https://archive.org/details/infernoofdante00dant |title=The Inferno of Dante: A New Verse Translation |publisher=Farrar, Straus & Giroux |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-374-17674-7 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.<ref name=\"kiparsky\">{{Cite journal |last=Kiparsky, Paul |date=Summer 1973 |title=The Role of Linguistics in a Theory of Poetry |journal=Daedalus |volume=102 |issue=3 |pages=231\u201344}}</ref>\n\nAlliteration is the repetition of letters or letter-sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.\n\nAssonance, where the use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the beginning or end of a word, was widely used in [[skald]]ic poetry but goes back to the Homeric epic.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Russom, Geoffrey |url=https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ |title=Beowulf and old Germanic metre |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59340-3 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/beowulfoldgerman0000russ/page/64 64\u201386] |url-access=registration}}</ref> Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Liu |first=James JY |title=Art of Chinese Poetry |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-48687-1 |pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word.

Some forms of poetry carry a consistent and well-defined rhyming scheme, such as the [[chant royal]] or the [[Ruba'i|rubaiyat]], while other poetic forms have variable rhyme schemes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=71\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nMost rhyme schemes are described using letters that correspond to sets of rhymes, so if the first, second and fourth lines of a quatrain rhyme with each other and the third line do not rhyme, the quatrain is said to have an \"aa-ba\" rhyme scheme. This rhyme scheme is the one used, for example, in the rubaiyat form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|p=27}}</ref> Similarly, an \"a-bb-a\" quatrain (what is known as \"[[enclosed rhyme]]\") is used in such forms as the [[Petrarchan sonnet]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Adams|1997|pp=88\u201391}}</ref> Some types of more complicated rhyming schemes have developed names of their own, separate from the \"a-bc\" convention, such as the [[ottava rima]] and [[terza rima]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=81\u201382, 85}}</ref> The types and use of differing rhyming schemes are discussed further in the [[rhyme scheme|main article]].\n\n=== Form in poetry ===\nPoetic form is more flexible in modernist and post-modernist poetry and continues to be less structured than in previous literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognizable structures or forms and write in [[free verse]]. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitworth |first=Michael H |title=Reading modernist poetry |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6731-4 |page=74}}</ref> Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hollander|1981|pp=50\u201351}}</ref>\n\nAmong major structural elements used in poetry are the line, the [[stanza]] or [[verse paragraph]], and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as [[canto]]s. Also sometimes used are broader visual presentations of words and [[calligraphy]]. These basic units of poetic form are often combined into larger structures, called ''poetic forms'' or poetic modes (see the following section), as in the [[sonnet]] or [[haiku]].\n\n==== Lines and stanzas ====\n{{main|Line (poetry)|Stanza}}\n\nPoetry is often separated into lines on a page, in a process known as [[line break (poetry)|lineation]]. These lines may be based on the number of metrical feet or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=7\u201313}}</ref> See the article on [[line break (poetry)|line breaks]] for information about the division between lines.\n\nLines of poems are often organized into [[stanza]]s, which are denominated by the number of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a [[couplet]] (or [[distich]]), three lines a [[tercet|triplet]] (or [[tercet]]), four lines a [[quatrain]], and so on. These lines may or may not relate to each other by rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201382}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Blok - Noch, ulica, fonar, apteka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Alexander Blok|Blok]]'s [[Russian language|Russian]] poem, \"''Noch, ulitsa, fonar, apteka''\" (\"Night, street, lamp, drugstore\"), on a wall in [[Leiden]]]]\n\nOther poems may be organized into [[verse paragraph]]s, in which regular rhymes with established rhythms are not used, but the poetic tone is instead established by a collection of rhythms, alliterations, and rhymes established in paragraph form.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=78}}</ref> Many medieval poems were written in verse paragraphs, even where regular rhymes and rhythms were used.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Middle English Literature: a guide to criticism |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-631-23290-2 |editor-last=Dalrymple, Roger |page=10}}</ref>\n\nIn many forms of poetry, stanzas are interlocking, so that the rhyming scheme or other structural elements of one stanza determine those of succeeding stanzas. Examples of such interlocking stanzas include, for example, the [[ghazal]] and the [[villanelle]], where a refrain (or, in the case of the villanelle, refrains) is established in the first stanza which then repeats in subsequent stanzas. Related to the use of interlocking stanzas is their use to separate thematic parts of a poem. For example, the [[strophe]], [[antistrophe]] and [[epode]] of the ode form are often separated into one or more stanzas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|pp=78\u201379}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases, particularly lengthier formal poetry such as some forms of epic poetry, stanzas themselves are constructed according to strict rules and then combined. In [[skald]]ic poetry, the [[dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tt]] stanza had eight lines, each having three \"lifts\" produced with alliteration or assonance. In addition to two or three alliterations, the odd-numbered lines had partial rhyme of consonants with dissimilar vowels, not necessarily at the beginning of the word; the even lines contained internal rhyme in set syllables (not necessarily at the end of the word). Each half-line had exactly six syllables, and each line ended in a trochee. The arrangement of dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts followed far less rigid rules than the construction of the individual dr\u00f3ttkv\u00e6tts.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Companion to Old Norse-Icelandic Literature and Culture |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-3738-6 |editor-last=McTurk, Rory |editor-link=Rory McTurk |pages=269\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==== Visual presentation ====\n{{Main|Visual poetry}}\n\nEven before the advent of printing, the visual appearance of poetry often added meaning or depth.

Visual elements have become an important part of the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some [[Modernism|Modernist]] poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's [[rhythm]] through visual [[caesura]]s of various lengths, or creates [[Contrast (linguistics)|juxtapositions]] so as to accentuate meaning, [[ambiguity]] or [[irony]], or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form.

By the 14th century and the [[Italian Renaissance]], the form had further crystallized under the pen of [[Petrarch]], whose sonnets were translated in the 16th century by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], who is credited with introducing the sonnet form into English literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corn|1997|p=94}}</ref> A traditional Italian or [[Petrarchan sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE'', though some variation, perhaps the most common being CDCDCD, especially within the final six lines (or ''sestet''), is common.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minta, Stephen |url=https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 |title=Petrarch and Petrarchism |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-7190-0748-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/petrarchpetrarch0000mint/page/15 15\u201317]}}</ref> The [[English sonnet|English (or Shakespearean) sonnet]] follows the rhyme scheme ''ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG'', introducing a third [[quatrain]] (grouping of four lines), a final [[couplet]], and a greater amount of variety with regard to rhyme than is usually found in its Italian predecessors. By convention, sonnets in English typically use [[iambic pentameter]], while in the [[Romance languages]], the [[hendecasyllable]] and [[Alexandrine]] are the most widely used meters.\n\nSonnets of all types often make use of a ''volta'', or \"turn,\" a point in the poem at which an idea is turned on its head, a question is answered (or introduced), or the subject matter is further complicated. This ''volta'' can often take the form of a \"but\" statement contradicting or complicating the content of the earlier lines. In the Petrarchan sonnet, the turn tends to fall around the division between the first two quatrains and the sestet, while English sonnets usually place it at or near the beginning of the closing couplet.\n[[File:Carol Ann Duffy (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|[[Carol Ann Duffy]]]]\nSonnets are particularly associated with high poetic diction, vivid imagery, and romantic love, largely due to the influence of Petrarch as well as of early English practitioners such as [[Edmund Spenser]] (who gave his name to the [[Spenserian sonnet]]), [[Michael Drayton]], and Shakespeare, whose [[Shakespeare's sonnets|sonnets]] are among the most famous in English poetry, with twenty being included in the ''[[Oxford Book of English Verse]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Oxford Book of English Verse |title-link=Oxford Book of English Verse |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1900 |editor-last=Quiller-Couch, Arthur}}</ref> However, the twists and turns associated with the ''volta'' allow for a logical flexibility applicable to many subjects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fussell|1965|pp=119\u201333}}</ref> Poets from the earliest centuries of the sonnet to the present have utilized the form to address topics related to politics ([[John Milton]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Claude McKay]]), theology ([[John Donne]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]]), war ([[Wilfred Owen]], [[e.e. cummings]]), and gender and sexuality ([[Carol Ann Duffy]]).

In all cases, rhyming is obligatory. The Yuefu is a folk ballad or a poem written in the folk ballad style, and the number of lines and the length of the lines could be irregular. For the other variations of ''shi'' poetry, generally either a four line (quatrain, or ''[[jueju]]'') or else an eight-line poem is normal; either way with the even numbered lines rhyming. The line length is scanned by an according number of characters (according to the convention that one character equals one syllable), and are predominantly either five or seven characters long, with a [[caesura]] before the final three syllables. The lines are generally end-stopped, considered as a series of couplets, and exhibit verbal parallelism as a key poetic device.<ref>[[Burton Watson|Watson, Burton]] (1971).

The basic form of jintishi (sushi) has eight lines in four couplets, with parallelism between the lines in the second and third couplets. The couplets with parallel lines contain contrasting content but an identical grammatical relationship between words. Jintishi often have a rich poetic diction, full of [[allusion]], and can have a wide range of subject, including history and politics.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Faurot |first=Jeannette L |url=https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 |title=Drinking with the moon |publisher=China Books & Periodicals |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8351-2639-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/drinkingwithmoon0000unse/page/30 30]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yugen |date=1 June 2004 |title=Shige: The Popular Poetics of Regulated Verse |journal=T'ang Studies |volume=2004 |issue=22 |pages=81\u2013125 |doi=10.1179/073750304788913221}}</ref> One of the masters of the form was [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770 CE), who wrote during the Tang Dynasty (8th century).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Schirokauer |first=Conrad |title=A brief history of Chinese and Japanese civilizations |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-15-505569-8 |edition=2nd |page=119}}</ref>\n\n=== Villanelle ===\n[[File:AudenLibraryOfCongress.jpg|thumb|upright|[[W.

The strophe and antistrophe look at the subject from different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues.

Although a few free verse poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition, light verse in English usually obeys at least some formal conventions.  Common forms include the [[limerick (poetry)|limerick]], the [[clerihew]], and the [[double dactyl]].\n\nWhile light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]], or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way.

Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the east and south;[b] Iran to the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to the north; and China to the northeast. Occupying 652,000 square kilometers (252,000 sq mi), it is a mountainous country with plains in the north and southwest. Kabul is the capital and largest city. The population is around 32 million, mostly composed of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks. Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the Middle Paleolithic Era, and the country's strategic location along the Silk Road connected it to the cultures of the Middle East and other parts of Asia. The land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns, including those by Alexander the Great, Mauryas, Muslim Arabs, Mongols, British, Soviets, and by the United States with allied countries. The land also served as the source from which the Kushans, Hephthalites, Samanids, Saffarids, Ghaznavids, Ghorids, Khaljis, Mughals, Hotaks, Durranis, and others have risen to form major empires. The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century, with Ahmad Shah Abdali being considered as the founder of the state. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the \"Great Game\" between British India and the Russian Empire. Its border with British India, the Durand Line, was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947.[13][14] In the First Anglo-Afghan War, the British East India Company seized control of Afghanistan briefly, but following the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming a monarchy under Amanullah Khan, until almost 50 years later when Zahir Shah was overthrown and a republic was established. In 1978, after a second coup Afghanistan first became a socialist state and then a Soviet protectorate. This evoked the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in the 1980s against mujahideen rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the Islamic fundamentalist group the Taliban, who ruled as a totalitarian regime for over five years. Following the 9/11 attacks, an intervention by the US and its allies forcibly removed the Taliban from power, and a new democratically-elected government was formed, but the Taliban still control a significant portion of the country. Afghanistan is a unitary presidential Islamic republic. The country has high levels of terrorism, poverty, child malnutrition, and corruption. It is a member of the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Group of 77, the Economic Cooperation Organization, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Afghanistan's economy is the world's 96th largest, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $72.9 billion by purchasing power parity; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 169th out of 186 countries as of 2018. \n\n'''Albania''' (/\u00e6l\u02c8be\u026ani\u0259, \u0254\u02d0l-/ (About this soundlisten) a(w)l-BAY-nee-\u0259; Albanian: Shqip\u00ebri or Shqip\u00ebria; Gheg Albanian: Shqipni or Shqipnia also Shqypni or Shqypnia),[6] officially the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Republika e Shqip\u00ebris\u00eb, pronounced [\u027e\u025bpu\u02c8blika \u025b \u0283cip\u0259\u02c8\u027ei\u02d0s\u0259]), is a country in Southeast Europe on the Adriatic and Ionian Sea within the Mediterranean Sea. It shares land borders with Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo[a] to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, Greece to the south and maritime borders with Greece, Montenegro and Italy to the west. Geographically, the country displays varied climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions, defined in an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi). It possesses remarkable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped mountains in the Albanian Alps as well as the Korab, Skanderbeg, Pindus and Ceraunian Mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea along the Mediterranean Sea. Historically, the country has been inhabited by numerous civilisations such as the Illyrians, Thracians, Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Venetians and Ottomans. The Albanians established the autonomous Principality of Arb\u00ebr in the 12th century. The Kingdom of Albania and Principality of Albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries. Prior to the Ottoman conquest of Albania in the 15th century, the Albanian resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe led by Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of Europe. Between the 18th and 19th centuries, Albanians gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength which conclusively led to the Albanian Renaissance. After the defeat of the Ottomans in the Balkan Wars, the modern nation state of Albania declared independence in 1912.[7] In the 20th century, the Kingdom of Albania was invaded by Italy which formed Greater Albania before becoming a protectorate of Nazi Germany.[8] Enver Hoxha formed Communist Albania after the Second World War and launched the Albanians on a path of oppression and decades of isolation. The Revolutions of 1991 concluded the fall of communism in Albania and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania. Politically, the country is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic and developing country with an upper-middle income economy dominated by the service sector, followed by manufacturing.[9] It went through a process of transition, following the end of communism in 1990, from centralized planning to a market-based economy.[10][11][12] Albania provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens.[5] The country is a member of the United Nations, World Bank, UNESCO, NATO, WTO, COE, OSCE and OIC. It is an official candidate for membership in the European Union.[13] It is one of the founding members of the Energy Community, including the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation and Union for the Mediterranean.  \n\n'''Algeria''' (/\u00e6l\u02c8d\u0292\u026a\u0259ri\u0259/ (About this soundlisten) al-JEER-ee-\u0259), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. The capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the far north of the country on the Mediterranean coast. With an area of 2,381,741 square kilometres (919,595 sq mi), Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest by area in the African Union and the Arab world.[10] With an estimated population of over 43 million, it is the eighth-most populous country in Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the southeast by Niger, to the southwest by Mali, Mauritania, and the Western Saharan territory, to the west by Morocco, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. It is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Pre-1962 Algeria has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient Numidians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Idrisid, Aghlabid, Rustamid, Fatimids, Zirid, Hammadids, Almoravids, Almohads, Zayyanids, Spaniards, Ottomans and finally, the French colonial empire. Algeria is a regional and middle power. It has the highest human development index of all non-island African countries and one of the largest economies on the continent, based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the 16th largest oil reserves in the world and the second largest in Africa, while it has the ninth largest reserves of natural gas. Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of natural gas to Europe. Algeria has one of the largest militaries in Africa and the largest defence budget. It is a member of the African Union, the Arab League, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\n'''Andorra''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0254\u02d0r\u0259/ (About this soundlisten), also UK: /\u00e6n\u02c8d\u0252r\u0259/;[11] Catalan: [\u0259n\u02c8dor\u0259]), officially the Principality of Andorra (Catalan: Principat d'Andorra), also called the Principality of the Valleys of Andorra[12] (Catalan: Principat de les Valls d'Andorra), is a sovereign landlocked microstate on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created by Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality was formed by a charter in 1278. It is known as a principality as it is a diarchy headed by two princes: the Bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain, and the President of the French Republic. Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 square kilometres (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately 77,006.[13][14] The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent.[15] Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and the 11th-smallest by population.[16] Its capital, Andorra la Vella, is the highest capital city in Europe, at an elevation of 1,023 metres (3,356 feet) above sea level.[17] The official language is Catalan, but Spanish, Portuguese, and French are also commonly spoken.[2][18] Tourism in Andorra sees an estimated 10.2 million visitors annually.[19] Andorra is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is its official currency. It has been a member of the United Nations since 1993.[20] In 2013, Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study.[21] \n\n'''Angola''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8\u0261o\u028al\u0259/ (About this soundlisten); Portuguese: [\u0250\u0303\u02c8\u0261\u0254l\u0250]), officially the Republic of Angola (Portuguese: Rep\u00fablica de Angola), is a country on the west coast of Southern Africa. It is the seventh-largest country in Africa, bordered by Namibia to the south, the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the north, Zambia to the east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Angola has an exclave province, the province of Cabinda that borders the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is Luanda. The territory of Angola has been inhabited since the Paleolithic Era, hosting a wide variety of ethnic groups, tribes and kingdoms. The nation state of Angola originated from Portuguese colonisation, which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The Portuguese colony that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the Kwanyama and the Mbunda. After a protracted anti-colonial struggle, independence was achieved in 1975 as the Marxist\u2013Leninist People's Republic of Angola, a one-party state supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. The civil war between the ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), supported by the United States and apartheid South Africa, lasted until 2002. The sovereign state has since become a relatively stable unitary, presidential constitutional republic. Angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves, and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the standard of living remains low for most of the population, and life expectancy in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while infant mortality is among the highest.[5] Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population.[6] Angola is a member state of the United Nations, OPEC, African Union, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, and the Southern African Development Community. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 25.8 million people span tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, in the predominance of the Portuguese language and of the Catholic Church. \n\n'''Antigua and Barbuda''' (/\u00e6n\u02c8ti\u02d0\u0261(w)\u0259\u2009...\u2009b\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8b(j)u\u02d0d\u0259/ (About this soundlisten); an-TEE-g(w)\u0259 ... bar-B(Y)OO-d\u0259) is an island sovereign state in the West Indies in the Americas, lying between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It consists of two major islands, Antigua and Barbuda (separated by 39 miles), and a number of smaller islands (including Great Bird, Green, Guiana, Long, Maiden, Prickly Pear, York Islands and further south, the island of Redonda). The permanent population numbers about 95,900 (2018 est.), with 97% being resident on Antigua.[1] The capital and largest port and city is St. John's on Antigua, with Codrington being the largest town on Barbuda. Lying near each other (the main Barbuda airport is less than 0.5\u00b0 of latitude, or 56 kilometres (30 nautical miles), north of the main Antigua airport), Antigua and Barbuda are in the middle of the Leeward Islands, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at 17\u00b0N of the equator. The island of Antigua was explored by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and named for the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda La Antigua.[6] Antigua was colonized by Britain in 1632; Barbuda island was first colonised in 1678.[6] Antigua and Barbuda joined the West Indies Federation in 1958.[7] With the breakup of the federation, it became one of the West Indies Associated States in 1967.[8] Following by self-governing on its internal affairs, independence was granted from United Kingdom on 1 November 1981. Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the Commonwealth and Elizabeth II is the country's queen and head of state.[9] In September 2017, Hurricane Irma damaged or destroyed 95% of Barbuda's buildings and infrastructure and as a result, all the island's inhabitants were evacuated to Antigua, leaving Barbuda empty for the first time in modern history.[10] \n\n'''Argentina''' (Spanish: [a\u027exen\u02c8tina]), officially the Argentine Republic[A] (Spanish: Rep\u00fablica Argentina), is a country located mostly in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the fourth largest in the Americas, the second largest in South America after Brazil, and the largest Spanish-speaking nation. The sovereign state is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (Spanish: provincias, singular provincia) and one autonomous city (ciudad aut\u00f3noma), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation (Spanish: Capital Federal) as decided by Congress.[17] The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over part of Antarctica, the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. The earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period.[18] The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century.[19] Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata,[20] a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810\u20131818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation of provinces with Buenos Aires as its capital city. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, radically reshaping its cultural and demographic outlook; 62.5% of the population has full or partial Italian ancestry,[11][21] and the Argentine culture has significant connections to the Italian culture.[22] The almost-unparalleled increase in prosperity led to Argentina becoming the seventh wealthiest nation in the world by the early 20th century.[23][24][25] Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, Argentina descended into political instability and economic decline that pushed it back into underdevelopment,[26] though it remained among the fifteen richest countries for several decades.[23] Following the death of President Juan Per\u00f3n in 1974, his widow, Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n, ascended to the presidency. She was overthrown in 1976 by a U.S.-backed coup which installed a right-wing military dictatorship. The military government persecuted and murdered numerous political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism that lasted until the election of Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn as President in 1983. Several of the junta's leaders were later convicted of their crimes and sentenced to imprisonment. Argentina is a developing country and ranks 48th on the Human Development Index, the second highest in Latin America after Chile.[16] It is a regional power in Latin America and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs.[27][28][29] Argentina maintains the second largest economy in South America, the third-largest in Latin America, and is a member of G-15 and G-20. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States. \n\n'''Armenia''' (/\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8mi\u02d0ni\u0259/ (About this soundlisten);[16] Armenian: \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576, romanized: Hayastan, IPA: [h\u0251j\u0251s\u02c8t\u0251n]), officially the Republic of Armenia (Armenian: \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0576\u0580\u0561\u057a\u0565\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576, romanized: Hayastani Hanrapetut'yun, IPA: [h\u0251j\u0251st\u0251\u02c8ni h\u0251n\u027e\u0251p\u025btut\u02b0\u02c8jun]), is a landlocked country in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia,[17][18] on the Armenian Highlands, it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Georgia to the north, the de facto independent Republic of Artsakh and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.[19]\nArmenia is a unitary, multi-party, democratic nation-state with an ancient cultural heritage. Urartu was established in 860 BC and by the 6th century BC it was replaced by the Satrapy of Armenia. The Kingdom of Armenia reached its height under Tigranes the Great in the 1st century BC and became the first state in the world to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the late 3rd or early 4th century AD.[20][21][22] The official date of state adoption of Christianity is 301.[23] The ancient Armenian kingdom was split between the Byzantine and Sasanian Empires around the early 5th century. Under the Bagratuni dynasty, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the Seljuk Turks. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom Cilician Armenia was located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea between the 11th and 14th centuries. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of Eastern Armenia and Western Armenia came under the rule of the Ottoman and Iranian empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the Russian Empire, while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During World War I, Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the Armenian Genocide. In 1918, following the Russian Revolution, all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, and in 1922 became a founding member of the Soviet Union. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, into full Union republics. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Armenia recognises the Armenian Apostolic Church, the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment.[24][5] The unique Armenian alphabet was invented by Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD. Armenia is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, the Council of Europe and the Collective Security Treaty Organization. Armenia supports the de facto independent Artsakh, which was proclaimed in 1991. \n\n'''Australia''', officially the '''Commonwealth of Australia''', is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] country comprising the mainland of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]], the island of [[Tasmania]], and numerous [[List of islands of Australia|smaller islands]].

It is bordered by [[Germany]] to the northwest, [[Czech Republic]] to the north, [[Slovakia]] to the northeast, [[Hungary]] to the east, [[Slovenia]] and [[Italy]] to the south, and [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] to the west. Austria occupies an area of 83,879 km<sup>2</sup> (32,386 sq mi) and has a population of nearly 9 million [[Austrians|people]]. While [[German language|German]] is the country's [[official language]], many Austrians communicate informally in a variety of [[Bavarian language|Bavarian dialects]]. Austria initially emerged as a [[Margraviate of Austria|margraviate]] around 976 and developed into a [[Duchy of Austria|duchy]] and [[Archduchy of Austria|archduchy]]. In the 16th century, Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[Royal house|royal dynasties]] in history. As an archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Early in the 19th century, Austria established [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]] but pursued its own course independently of the other German states. Following the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|compromise]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]] was established. Austria was involved in [[World War I]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] following the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Ferdinand]], the presumptive successor to the Austro-Hungarian throne. After the defeat and the dissolution of the Monarchy, the [[Republic of German-Austria]] was proclaimed with the intent of the union with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], which eventually failed because of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] and the state remained unrecognized. In 1919 the [[First Austrian Republic]] became the legal successor of [[Cisleithania|Austria]]. In 1938, the Austrian-born [[Adolf Hitler]], who became the [[German Chancellor|Chancellor]] of the [[German Reich]], achieved the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by the [[Anschluss]]. Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945 and an extended period of Allied occupation, Austria was re-established as a sovereign and self-governing democratic nation known as the Second Republic. Austria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a directly elected Federal [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of the federal government.

It is a member of the [[Commonwealth Realms]] under the monarchy of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. The [[archipelagic state]] consists of fewer than 700 [[Island|islands]], [[Cay|cays]], and [[Islet|islets]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and is located north of [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]] Island ([[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]), northwest of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], southeast of the [[United States|US]] state of [[Florida]], and east of the [[Florida Keys]]. The capital is [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on the island of [[New Providence]]. The [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]] describes The Bahamas' territory as encompassing 470,000 km<sup>2</sup> (180,000 sq mi) of ocean space. The Bahamas were inhabited by the [[Lucayan people|Lucayans]], a branch of the [[Arawakan]]-speaking [[Ta\u00edno people]], for many centuries. [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] was the first European to see the islands, making his first landfall in the '[[New World]]' in 1492. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]] shipped the native Lucayans to slavery on [[Hispaniola]], after which the Bahama islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648, when [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonists from [[Bermuda]] settled on the island of [[Eleuthera]]. The Bahamas became a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[crown colony]] in 1718, when the British clamped down on [[piracy]]. After the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Crown resettled thousands of [[American Loyalists]] to The Bahamas; they took their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants. African slaves and their descendants constituted the majority of the population from this period on. The slave trade was abolished by the British in 1807; slavery in The Bahamas was abolished in 1834. Subsequently, The Bahamas became a haven for freed African slaves. Africans liberated from illegal slave ships were resettled on the islands by the [[Royal Navy]], while some [[Slavery in North America|North American slaves]] and [[Seminole|Seminoles]] escaped to The Bahamas from Florida. Bahamians were even known to recognise the freedom of slaves carried by the ships of other nations which reached The Bahamas. Today [[Afro-Bahamians]] make up 90% of the population of 332,634. The Bahamas gained governmental independence in 1973 led by Sir Lynden O. Pindling, with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of The Bahamas|its queen]]. In terms of [[gross domestic product]] per capita, The Bahamas is one of the richest countries in the [[Americas]] (following the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), with an economy based on tourism and offshore finance. \n\n'''Bahrain''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0251\u02d0\u02c8re\u026an/]] (listen); [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646\u200e ''''al-Ba\u1e25rayn'''' <small>Arabic pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Arabic|[al ba\u0127rajn]]] (listen)), officially the '''Kingdom of Bahrain''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: \u0645\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0646\u200e ''Mamlakat al-Ba\u1e25rayn''), is a [[sovereign state]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].

According to the most recent 2010 census, Bahrain's population is over 1.2 million, of which around half are non-nationals. At 780 square kilometres (300 sq mi) in size, it is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|third-smallest nation]] in Asia after the [[Maldives]] and [[Singapore]]. The capital and largest city is [[Manama]]. Bahrain is the site of the ancient [[Dilmun civilization]]. It has been famed since antiquity for its [[pearl fisheries]], which were considered the best in the world into the 19th century. Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to [[Islam]], in 628 AD. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was ruled by the [[Portuguese Empire]] from 1521 until 1602, following the conquest by [[Shah]] [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] under the [[Persian Empire]]. In 1783, the [[Bani Utbah]] clan captured Bahrain from [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]] and it has since been ruled by the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa royal family]], with [[Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa|Ahmed al Fateh]] as Bahrain's first [[Hakim (title)#In%20Arab%20countries|''hakim'']]. Formerly an [[emirate]], Bahrain was declared an Islamic [[constitutional monarchy]] in 2002.

It is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|eighth-most populous country]] in the world, with a population exceeding 161 million people. In terms of land mass, Bangladesh ranks [[List of countries and dependencies by area|92nd]], spanning 147,570 square kilometres (56,980 sq mi), making it one of the most [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|densely-populated]] countries in the world. Bangladesh shares land borders with [[India]] to the west, north, and east, [[Myanmar]] to the southeast, and the [[Bay of Bengal]] to the south. It is narrowly separated from [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by India's [[Siliguri Corridor]], and from [[China]] by the Indian state of [[Sikkim]], in the north, respectively. [[Dhaka]], the capital and largest city, is the nation's economic, political and cultural hub. [[Chittagong]], the [[Port of Chittagong|largest sea port]], is the second largest city. With numerous criss-crossing rivers and inland waterways, the dominant geographic feature of Bangladesh is the [[Ganges delta]], which empties into the [[Bay of Bengal]] with the combined waters of several [[River system|river systems]], including the [[Brahmaputra river]] and the [[Ganges river]]. [[List of mountains in Bangladesh|Highlands]], with evergreen forests, cover the northeastern and southeastern regions, while the country's [[biodiversity]] comprises a vast array of plants and wildlife, including the endangered [[Bengal tiger|Royal Bengal tiger]], which is the [[National symbols of Bangladesh|national animal]]. The seacoast features the world's longest natural sandy beach in [[Cox's Bazar]] as well as the [[Sundarbans]], which is the world's largest mangrove forest. Bangladesh forms the larger and eastern part of the [[Bengal]] region. According to the ancient sacred Indian texts, ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the [[Vanga Kingdom]], one of the namesakes of the [[Bengal]] region, was a strong naval ally of the [[Ayodhya (legendary city)|legendary Ayodhya]]. In the ancient and classical period of the [[Indian subcontinent]], the territory was home to many principalities, including the [[Pundravardhana|Pundra]], [[Gangaridai]], [[Gauda Kingdom|Gauda]], [[Samatata]] and [[Harikela]]. It was also a [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan province]] under the reign of [[Ashoka]]. The principalities were notable for their overseas trade, contacts with the Roman world, export of fine [[Muslin trade in Bengal|muslin]] and silk to the Middle East, and spreading of philosophy and art to Southeast Asia. The [[Pala Empire]], the [[Chandra dynasty]], and the [[Sena dynasty]] were the last pre-Islamic Bengali [[Middle kingdoms of India|middle kingdoms]]. [[Islam]] was introduced during the [[Pala Empire]], through trade with the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], but following the early conquest of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiyar Khalji]] and the subsequent establishment of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and preaching of [[Shah Jalal]] in East Bengal, the faith fully spread across the region. In 1576, the wealthy [[Bengal Sultanate]] was absorbed into the [[Mughal Empire]], but its rule was briefly interrupted by the [[Suri Empire]]. Following the death of Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in the early 1700s, the [[Proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] became a semi-independent state under the [[Nawabs of Bengal]]. The region was later conquered by the [[British East India Company]] at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757. The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the separation of [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|India]] in August 1947, when the region became [[East Pakistan]] as a part of the newly formed [[Dominion of Pakistan|State of Pakistan]], demarcated by the ''Boundary of the Partition of India''. Later the rise of the [[Bengali nationalist]] and self-determination movement led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Liberation War]] and eventually resulted in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign and independent nation in 1971. Speakers of the official [[Bengali language]], who form the [[Bengalis|Bengali]] ethnic group, make up 98% of the population. Bangladesh is created on the basis of language and ethnicity. Its large Muslim population makes Bangladesh the [[Islam by country|fourth-largest Muslim-majority country in the world]]. The constitution declares Bangladesh a [[Secular state|secular]], Muslim-majority country. A [[middle power]], Bangladesh is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[constitutional republic]] following the [[Westminster system]] of governance. The country is divided into [[Divisions of Bangladesh|eight administrative divisions]] and [[Districts of Bangladesh|sixty-four districts]]. Although the country continues to face the challenges of the [[Rohingya genocide|Rohingya refugee crisis]], [[Corruption in Bangladesh|corruption]] and the adverse effects of [[Climate change in Bangladesh|climate change]], it is one of the [[emerging and growth-leading economies]] of the world. Bangladesh is also one of the [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next%20Eleven|Next Eleven]] countries, with one of the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest real GDP growth rates]] in the world. Its [[gross domestic product]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|39th]] largest in terms of market [[exchange rates]], and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|29th]] in [[purchasing power parity]]. Bangladesh's [[per capita income]] ranks [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|143th]] nominally and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|136th]] by [[purchasing power parity]]. In recent years Bangladesh has registered notable success in reducing [[child mortality]]; [[population control]]; combating natural disasters; women's empowerment; using [[microcredit]] to alleviate poverty; and boosting income through the [[Textile industry in Bangladesh|export of textiles]], garments, pharmaceuticals, manpower, agricultural produce, shrimps, jute, leather goods, seafood, tea, etc. Bangladesh is one of the few countries that achieved most of the 2015 [[Millennium Development Goals]] set by the [[United Nations|UN]] ahead of time. As a result of this and many other factors the [[World Bank]] upgraded the status of Bangladesh to a middle-income country. \n\n'''Barbados''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8be\u026ad\u0252s/]] (listen) or [[Help:IPA/English|/-do\u028as/]]) is an [[island country]] in the [[Lesser Antilles]] of the [[West Indies]], in the [[Caribbean]] region of [[North America]]. It is 34 kilometres (21 miles) in length and up to 23 km (14 mi) in width, covering an area of 432 km<sup>2</sup> (167 sq mi). It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100 km (62 mi) east of the [[Windward Islands]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]; therein, Barbados is east of the Windwards, part of the Lesser Antilles, roughly at [[13th parallel north|13\u00b0N]] of the [[equator]]. It is about 168 km (104 mi) east of both the countries of [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] and 180 km (110 mi) south-east of [[Martinique]] and 400 km (250 mi) north-east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Barbados is outside the principal Atlantic [[hurricane belt]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Bridgetown, Barbados|Bridgetown]]. Inhabited by [[Island Caribs|Kalinago]] people since the 13th century, and prior to that by other [[Amerindian|Amerindians]], Barbados was visited by Spanish navigators in the late 15th century and claimed for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]. It first appeared in a Spanish map in 1511. [[The Portuguese Empire]] claimed the island between 1532 and 1536, but later abandoned it in 1620; with their only remnants being an introduction of wild boars for a good supply of meat whenever the island was visited, and to replenish their supply of freshwater. An English ship, the ''Olive Blossom'', arrived in Barbados on 14 May 1625; its men took possession of it in the name of [[James VI and I|King James I]]. In 1627, the first permanent settlers arrived from England, and it became an [[English overseas possessions|English]] and later [[British colonisation of the Americas#British%20Caribbean%20colonies|British colony]]. As a wealthy sugar colony, it became an English centre of the [[African slave trade]] until that trade was outlawed in [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807]], with final emancipation of slaves in Barbados occurring over a period of years from [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|1833]]. On 30 November 1966, Barbados became an independent state and [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Barbados|its queen]]. It has a population of 287,010 people, predominantly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island, Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist destination. Of the tourists, 40% come from the UK, with the US and Canada making up the next large groups of visitors to the island.<sup>[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']</sup>\n\n'''Belarus''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025bl\u0259\u02c8ru\u02d0s/]]; [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c, <small>IPA:</small> [[Help:IPA/Belarusian|[b\u02b2\u025bla\u02c8rus\u02b2]]]), officially the '''Republic of Belarus''' ([[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: \u0420\u044d\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c, [[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c), formerly known by its [[Russian language|Russian]] name '''Byelorussia''' or '''Belorussia''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Eastern Europe]] bordered by [[Russia]] to the northeast, [[Ukraine]] to the south, [[Poland]] to the west, and [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]] to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is [[Minsk]]. Over 40% of its 207,600 square kilometres (80,200 sq mi) is forested. Its major economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing. Until the 20th century, different states at various times controlled the lands of modern-day Belarus, including the [[Principality of Polotsk]] (11th to 14th centuries), the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], different states arose competing for legitimacy amidst the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], ultimately ending in the rise of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Byelorussian SSR) which became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] in 1922. Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were reintegrated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], and were finalized after World War II. During WWII, military operations devastated Belarus, which lost about a quarter of its population and half of its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the [[United Nations]], along with the Soviet Union and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. The parliament of the republic proclaimed the [[sovereignty]] of Belarus on 27 July 1990, and during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Belarus declared independence on 25 August 1991. In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the [[Union State]]. [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has served as the country's first president since 1994. Belarus has been labeled \"Europe's last dictatorship\" by some Western journalists, on account of Lukashenko's self-described [[authoritarian]] style of government. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as [[state ownership]] of large sections of the [[Economy of Belarus|economy]]. [[Elections in Belarus|Elections under Lukashenko's rule]] have been widely criticized as unfair; and according to many countries and organizations, political opposition has been violently suppressed. Belarus is also the last country in Europe using the [[Capital punishment in Belarus|death penalty]]. Belarus's [[Democracy Index]] rating is the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as \"not free\" by [[Freedom House]], as \"repressed\" in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], and is rated as by far the worst country for [[press freedom]] in Europe in the [[Press Freedom Index|2013\u201314 Press Freedom Index]] published by [[Reporters Without Borders]], which ranks Belarus 157th out of 180 nations. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49 million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]]. Belarus is a member of the [[United Nations]] since its founding, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]], [[Eurasian Economic Union|EEU]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus\u2013European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the organisation]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].\n\n'''Belgium''', officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a country in [[Western Europe]]. It is bordered by the [[Netherlands]] to the north, [[Germany]] to the east, [[Luxembourg]] to the southeast, [[France]] to the southwest, and the [[North Sea]] to the northwest. It covers an area of 30,689 km<sup>2</sup> (11,849 sq mi) and has a population of more than 11.5 million, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|22nd most densely populated]] country in the world and the [[Area and population of European countries|6th most densely populated]] country in Europe, with a density of 376 per square kilometre (970/sq mi). The capital and largest city is [[Brussels City|Brussels]]; other major cities are [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Charleroi]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Legally, Belgium is a [[sovereign state]] and a [[Federation|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]]. Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. It is divided into three highly [[autonomous]] [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|regions]]: the [[Flemish Region]] in the north, [[Wallonia]] in the south, and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of [[GDP per capita]]. Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or ''[[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|communities]]'': the Dutch-speaking [[Flemish Community]], which constitutes about 60 percent of the population, and the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking Community]], which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. A small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], numbering around one percent, exists in the [[East Cantons]]. The Brussels-Capital Region is officially bilingual (French and Dutch), although French is the dominant language. Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its [[History of Belgium|political history]] and [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|complex system of governance]], made up of [[List of governments in Belgium|six different governments]]. Historically, Belgium is part of an area known as the [[Low Countries]], a somewhat larger region than the current [[Benelux]] group of states that also included parts of northern France and western Germany. Its modern name is derived from the Latin word ''Belgium'', used in [[Julius Caesar]]'s \"[[Gallic War]]\", to describe the region in the period around 55 BCE. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan center of commerce and culture. Between the 16th and early 19th centuries, Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, earning the moniker the \"Battlefield of Europe\", a reputation strengthened by both [[World war|world wars]]. The country emerged in 1830 following the [[Belgian Revolution]] when it seceded from the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. Belgium participated in the [[Industrial Revolution]] and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed [[Belgian overseas colonies|a number of colonies in Africa]]. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by [[Culture of Belgium|differences in language and culture]] and the [[North-South divide in Belgium|unequal economic development]] of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several [[State reform in Belgium|far-reaching reforms]], resulting in a transition from a [[Unitary state|unitary]] to a [[Federalism|federal]] arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly [[Flemish Movement|among the Flemish]]; controversial language laws exist such as the [[municipalities with language facilities]]; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the [[Belgian federal election, 2010|June 2010 federal election]], a world record. Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the war. Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the [[European Union]] and its capital, Brussels, hosts the official seats of the [[European Commission]], the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Council]], as well as one of two seats of the [[European Parliament]] (the other being [[Strasbourg]]). Belgium is also a founding member of the [[Eurozone]], [[NATO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the [[Schengen Area]]. Brussels hosts several of the EU's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO. Belgium is a [[developed country]], with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]]. It has very high standards of [[Standard of living|living]], [[quality of life]], [[Health care|healthcare]], [[education]], and is categorized as \"very high\" in the [[Human Development Index]]. It also ranks as one of the [[Global Peace Index|safest or most peaceful countries]] in the world. \n\n'''Belize''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8li\u02d0z/]] (listen)) is a [[Caribbean]] country located on the northeastern coast of [[Central America]]. Belize is bordered on the northwest by [[Mexico]], on the east by the [[Caribbean Sea]], and on the south and west by [[Guatemala]]. It has an area of 22,970 square kilometres (8,867 sq mi) and a population of 408,487 (2019). Its mainland is about 290 km (180 mi) long and 110 km (68 mi) wide. It has the lowest population and [[population density]] in Central America. The country's population growth rate of 1.87% per year (2018 estimate) is the second highest in the region and one of the [[List of countries by population growth rate|highest in the Western Hemisphere]]. The [[Mayan civilization|Maya Civilization]] spread into the area of Belize between 1500 B.C. and A.D. 300 and flourished until about 1200. European contact began in 1502 when [[Christopher Columbus]] sailed along the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. European exploration was begun by English settlers in 1638. This period was also marked by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] both laying claim to the land until Britain defeated the Spanish in the [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] (1798). It became a British colony in 1840, known as [[British Honduras]], and a [[Crown colony]] in 1862. Independence was achieved from the [[United Kingdom]] on 21 September 1981. Belize has a diverse society that is composed of many cultures and languages that reflect its rich history. [[English language|English]] is the official language of Belize, while [[Belizean Creole]] is the most widely spoken [[national language]], being the native language of over a third of the population. Over half the population is [[multilingual]], with Spanish being the second most common spoken language. It is known for its [[September Celebrations]], its extensive barrier reef [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] and [[Punta|punta music]]. Belize's abundance of terrestrial and marine species and its diversity of ecosystems give it a key place in the globally significant [[Mesoamerican Biological Corridor]]. It is considered a Central American and [[Caribbean]] nation with strong ties to both the American and Caribbean regions. It is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC), and the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA), the only country to hold full membership in all three regional organizations. Belize is a [[Commonwealth realm]], with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of Belize|its monarch]] and [[head of state]]. \n\n'''Benin''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025b\u02c8ni\u02d0n/]] (listen) [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|''ben-EEN'']], [[Help:IPA/English|/b\u026a\u02c8ni\u02d0n/]] [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|''bin-EEN'']]; [[French language|French]]: ''B\u00e9nin'' [[Help:IPA/French|[ben\u025b\u0303]]]), officially the '''Republic of Benin''' ([[French language|French]]: ''R\u00e9publique du B\u00e9nin'') and formerly '''[[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey (1960\u20131975)]]''', is a country in [[West Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Togo]] to [[Benin\u2013Togo border|the west]], [[Nigeria]] to [[Benin\u2013Nigeria border|the east]], [[Burkina Faso]] to [[Benin-Burkina Faso border|the north-west]], and [[Niger]] to [[Benin\u2013Niger border|the north-east]]. The majority of its population lives on the small southern coastline of the [[Bight of Benin]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the northernmost tropical portion of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The capital of Benin is [[Porto-Novo]], but the [[seat of government]] is in [[Cotonou]], the country's largest city and economic capital. Benin covers an area of 114,763 square kilometres (44,310 sq mi) and its population in 2018 was estimated to be approximately 11.49 million. Benin is a [[tropical]] nation, highly dependent on [[agriculture]], and is a large exporter of [[cotton]] and [[palm oil]]. Substantial employment and income arise from [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]]. The [[official language]] of Benin is [[French language|French]], with several indigenous languages such as [[Fon language|Fon]], [[Bariba language|Bariba]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Dendi language|Dendi]] also being commonly spoken. The largest religious group in Benin is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], followed closely by [[Islam]], [[Vodun]] (commonly referred to as Voodoo outside the country) and [[Protestants|Protestantism]]. Benin is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]], the [[Community of Sahel\u2013Saharan States]], the [[African Petroleum Producers Association]] and the [[Niger Basin Authority]]. Little is known of Benin's early history. From the 17th to the 19th century, the main political entities in the area were the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], along with the city-state of [[Porto-Novo]], and a large area with many different nations to the north. This region was referred to as the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] from as early as the 17th century due to the large number of enslaved people who were shipped to the New World during the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]]. After enslavement was abolished, France took over the country and renamed it [[French Dahomey]]. In 1960, Dahomey gained full independence from France. The [[sovereign state]] has had a tumultuous history since then, with many different democratic governments, military coups, and military governments. A [[Marxist\u2013Leninist state]] called the [[People's Republic of Benin]] existed between 1975 and 1990. In 1991, it was replaced by the current [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] Republic of Benin. \n\n'''Bhutan''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/bu\u02d0\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0n/]] (listen); [[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]]: \u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f61\u0f74\u0f63\u0f0b, <small>[[Romanization of Dzongkha|romanized]]:</small> ''[[Druk]] Yul'' [[Help:IPA|[\u0288uk\u031a\u02e9.y\u02d0\u02e9]]]), officially the '''Kingdom of Bhutan''' ([[Dzongkha language|Dzongkha]]: \u0f60\u0f56\u0fb2\u0f74\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f92\u0fb1\u0f63\u0f0b\u0f41\u0f56\u0f0b, <small>[[Romanization of Dzongkha|romanized]]:</small> ''Druk Gyal Khap''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[South Asia]]. Located in the [[Eastern Himalaya|Eastern Himalayas]], it is bordered by the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]] in the north, the [[Chumbi Valley]] of Tibet, China and the Indian states of Sikkim and [[West Bengal]] in the west, and the Indian states of [[Assam]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] in the south and east. Bhutan is geopolitically in [[South Asia]] and is the region's second-least-populous nation after the [[Maldives]]. [[Thimphu]] is its capital and largest city, while [[Phuntsholing]] is its financial center. Bhutan's independence has endured for centuries. It has never been colonized in [[History of Bhutan|its history]]. Situated on the ancient [[Silk Road]] between Tibet, the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]], the Bhutanese state developed a distinct [[Culture of Bhutan|national identity]] based on [[Buddhism]]. Headed by a spiritual leader known as the [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]], the territory comprised many [[Fief|fiefdoms]] and was governed as a Buddhist theocracy. Following a civil war in the 19th century, the [[House of Wangchuck]] reunited the country and established relations with the [[British Empire]]. After the end of the [[British Raj]], Bhutan fostered a strategic partnership with India during the rise of Chinese communism; it has a disputed border with China. In the early 1990s, the government deported much of the country's [[Nepali language|Nepali-speaking]] [[Lhotsampa]] minority, sparking a refugee crisis in nearby [[Nepal]]. In 2008, Bhutan transitioned from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[constitutional monarchy]] and held the first election to the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly of Bhutan]]. The National Assembly is part of the bicameral parliament of the [[Bhutanese democracy]]. The country's landscape ranges from lush subtropical plains in the south to the sub-alpine Himalayan mountains in the north, where there are peaks higher than 7,000 metres (23,000 ft). [[Gangkhar Puensum]] is Bhutan's highest peak and may also be the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The [[wildlife of Bhutan]] is notable for its diversity. In South Asia, Bhutan ranks first in [[Index of Economic Freedom|economic freedom]], [[Ease of doing business index|ease of doing business]], and [[Global Peace Index|peace]], and is the [[Corruption Perceptions Index|least corrupt country]] in the region as of 2016. It continues to be a [[Least Developed Countries|least developed country]], but expects to graduate from this status by 2023. Hydroelectricity accounts for most of its exports. [[Politics of Bhutan|The government]] is a parliamentary democracy; the head of state is the [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck|King of Bhutan]], known as the \"[[Druk Gyalpo|Dragon King]].\" Bhutan maintains diplomatic relations with 52 countries and the [[European Union]], but does not have formal ties with the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation|BIMSTEC]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. The [[Royal Bhutan Army]] maintains a close relationship with the [[Indian Armed Forces]].Bhutan is also notable for pioneering the concept of [[Gross National Happiness|gross national happiness]]. \n\n'''Bolivia''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8l\u026avi\u0259/]] (listen) <small>Spanish pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Spanish|[bo.\u02c8li.\u03b2ja]]]), officially the '''Plurinational State of Bolivia''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia'' <small>Spanish pronunciation:</small> [[Help:IPA/Spanish|[es\u02c8ta\u00f0o plu\u027einasjo\u02c8nal de \u03b2o\u02c8li\u03b2ja]]] (listen)), is a [[landlocked country]] located in western-central [[South America]]. The constitutional capital is [[Sucre]], while the [[seat of government]] and executive capital is [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands), a mostly flat region in the east of the country. The [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With 1,098,581 km<sup>2</sup> (424,164 sq mi) of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], after [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] (and alongside [[Paraguay]], one of the only two landlocked countries in the [[Americas]]), the [[List of countries by area|27th largest in the world]], the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] and the world's [[Landlocked country|seventh largest landlocked country]], after [[Kazakhstan]], [[Mongolia]], [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The country's population, estimated at 11 million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo|Mestizos]], [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Africans]]. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous languages]] also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]]. Before Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]]. After the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The%20Banzer%20regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[Left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001. Modern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]]. Bolivia remains the second poorest country in South America. It is a [[developing country]], with a medium ranking in the [[Human Development Index]] and a poverty level of 38.6%. Its main economic activities include [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing]], [[mining]], and [[manufacturing]] goods such as textiles, clothing, refined metals, and [[Oil refinery|refined petroleum]]. Bolivia is very [[Geology of Bolivia|rich in minerals]], including [[tin]], [[silver]], and [[lithium]]. \n\n'''Bosnia and Herzegovina''', abbreviated '''BiH''' or '''B&H''', sometimes called '''Bosnia\u2013Herzegovina''' and [[Pars pro toto#Geography|often known informally as]] '''Bosnia''', is a country in [[Southern Europe|South]] and [[Southeast Europe]], located within the [[Balkans]]. [[Sarajevo]] is the capital and largest city. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not entirely a [[landlocked country]] as it may appear on a map \u2013 to the south it has a narrow coast on the [[Adriatic Sea]], which is about 20 kilometres (12 miles) long and surrounds the town of [[Neum]]. It is bordered by [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, and [[Croatia]] to the north and southwest. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest moderately hilly, and in the northeast predominantly flatland. The inland, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip, [[Herzegovina]], has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and mostly mountainous topography. Bosnia and Herzegovina was settled at least from [[Upper Palaeolithic]] and has preserved prehistoric art found in [[Badanj Cave|Badanj cave]]. The permanent human settlement traces back to the [[Neolithic]] age, inhabited by cultures such as [[Butmir culture|Butmir]], [[Kakanj culture|Kakanj]], and [[Vu\u010dedol culture|Vu\u010dedol]]. After arrival of the first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] it was populated by several [[Illyria|Illyrian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich but complex history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it remained from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878\u20131918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia and Herzegovina was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], it was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia%20and%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995 with the Dayton Agreement]]. [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] has grown at double digit rates in recent years. Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural environment and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter%20sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]], and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe. The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], as specified in the constitution. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second, and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is usually identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. Minorities, defined [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|under the constitutional nomenclature \"Others\"]], include [[Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Roma]], [[National minorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Poles, Ukrainians, and Turks]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third unit, the [[Br\u010dko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of 10 [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina [[List of countries by Human Development Index#High%20human%20development|ranks highly in terms of human development]], and has an economy dominated by the industry and agriculture sectors, followed by the tourism and service sectors. The country has a social security and universal healthcare system, and primary- and secondary-level education is tuition-free. It is a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[OSCE]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Partnership for Peace|PfP]], [[CEFTA]], and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]] upon its establishment in July 2008. The country is an [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|applicant for membership to the European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]].\n\n'''Botswana''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0252t\u02c8sw\u0251\u02d0n\u0259/]] (listen), <small>also</small> <small>[[British English|UK]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/b\u028at-, b\u028a\u02c8t\u0283w-/]]), officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ([[Setswana]]: ''Lefatshe la Botswana''), is a [[landlocked country]] in [[Southern Africa]]. Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has been a [[representative republic]], with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]] and the lowest perceived corruption ranking in Africa since at least 1998. It is currently Africa's oldest continuous democracy. Botswana is topographically flat, with up to 70 percent of its territory being the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north near [[Kazungula, Zambia|Kazungula]] is poorly defined but is, at most, a few hundred metres long. A mid-sized country of just over 2.3 million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] countries in the world. Around 10 percent of the population lives in the capital and largest city, [[Gaborone]]. Formerly one of the poorest countries in the world\u2014with a GDP per capita of about US$70 per year in the late 1960s\u2014Botswana has since transformed itself into one of the world's fastest-growing economies. The economy is dominated by [[Mining industry of Botswana|mining]], cattle, and [[Tourism in Botswana|tourism]]. Botswana boasts a GDP ([[purchasing power parity]]) per capita of about $18,825 per year as of 2015, which is one of the highest in Africa. Its high [[gross national income]] (by some estimates the fourth-largest in Africa) gives the country a relatively high standard of living and the highest [[Human Development Index]] of continental [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Botswana is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Southern African Development Community]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and the [[United Nations]]. The country has been among the hardest hit by the [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|HIV/AIDS epidemic]]. Despite the success in programmes to make treatments available to those infected, and to educate the populace in general about how to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, the number of people with AIDS rose from 290,000 in 2005 to 320,000 in 2013. As of 2014, Botswana has the [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|third-highest prevalence rate]] for HIV/AIDS, with roughly 20% of the population infected.\n\n'''Brazil''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Brasil''; Portuguese pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[b\u027ea\u02c8ziw]]]), officially the '''Federative Republic of Brazil''' (Portuguese: ''Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil'', listen <small>([[wikipedia:Media help|help]]\u00b7[[:File:Pt-br-Rep\u00fablica Federativa do Brasil.ogg|info]])</small>), is the largest country in both [[South America]] and [[Latin America]].

Its capital is [[Bras\u00edlia]], and [[List of largest cities in Brazil|its most populous city]] is [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 [[States of Brazil|states]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. It is the largest country to have [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as an [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|official language]] and the only one in the [[Americas]]; it is also one of the most [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass [[Immigration to Brazil|immigration from around the world]]. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a [[Coastline of Brazil|coastline]] of 7,491 kilometers (4,655 mi). It borders all other countries in South America except [[Ecuador]] and [[Chile]] and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its [[Amazon River basin]] includes a [[Amazon rainforest|vast tropical forest]], home to diverse [[Wildlife of Brazil|wildlife]], a variety of [[Environment of Brazil|ecological systems]], and extensive natural resources spanning numerous [[Protected areas of Brazil|protected habitats]]. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]], and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. Brazil was inhabited by [[Indigenous Brazilian|numerous tribal nations]] prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], who claimed the area for the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Brazil remained a [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony]] until 1808, when the capital of the empire was [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. [[Brazilian Independence|Independence]] was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the [[Empire of Brazil]], a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]]. The country [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|became a presidential republic]] in 1889 following a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. An authoritarian [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military junta]] came to power [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|in 1964]] and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current [[Constitution of Brazil|constitution]], formulated in 1988, defines it as a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[federal republic]]. Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks [[List of World Heritage Sites in Brazil|thirteenth in the world]] by number of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Sites]]. Brazil is considered an advanced [[emerging economy]]. It has the ninth largest GDP in the world by [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal]], and eight by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|PPP]] measures. It is one of the world's major [[Breadbasket|breadbaskets]], being the largest [[Coffee production in Brazil|producer of coffee]] for the last 150 years. It is classified as an upper-middle income economy by the [[World Bank]] and a [[newly industrialized country]], with [[National wealth|the largest share of global wealth]] in Latin America. Brazil is a [[regional power]] and sometimes considered a [[Great power|great]] or a [[middle power]] in [[international affairs]]. On account of its international recognition and influence, the country is subsequently classified as an [[emerging power]] and a [[Potential superpowers|potential superpower]] by several analysts. Brazil is a founding member of the [[United Nations]], the [[G-20 major economies|G20]], [[BRICS]], [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Mercosur|Mercosul]], [[Organization of American States]], [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]]. \n\n'''Brunei''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/bru\u02d0\u02c8na\u026a/]] (listen) [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|''broo-NY'']]; <small>Malay:</small> [[Help:IPA/Malay|[bruna\u026a]]] (listen)), officially the '''Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Negara Brunei Darussalam'', [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: \u0646\u06ac\u0627\u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u200e), is a [[Sovereign state|country]] located on the north coast of the island of [[Borneo]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], the country is completely surrounded by the insular [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] [[Federated state|state]] of [[Sarawak]]. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of [[Limbang District|Limbang]]. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and [[Indonesia]]. [[Demographics of Brunei|Brunei's population]] was 428,963 in 2018. The [[Government of Brunei|government]] is an absolute monarchy under the [[Sultan of Brunei|Sultan]] which implements [[sharia law]] and directs [[Islam|Islamic]] practices. At the peak of the [[Bruneian Empire]], [[Bolkiah|Sultan Bolkiah]] (reigned 1485\u20131528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of [[Borneo]], including modern-day Sarawak and [[Sabah]], as well as the [[Sulu Archipelago]] off the northeast tip of Borneo, [[Seludong]] (modern-day [[Manila]]), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The [[Thalassocracy|maritime state]] was visited by Spain's [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan Expedition]] in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 [[Castilian War]]. During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ([[Kuching]]) to [[James Brooke]] and installed him as the [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]], and it ceded Sabah to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. In 1888, Brunei became a [[British protectorate]] and was assigned a [[Resident (title)|British resident]] as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small [[Brunei revolt|armed rebellion]] against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British. Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[Southeast Asian]] nations, after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a \"[[developed country]]\". According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being [[Libya]]) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. ''[[Forbes]]'' also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.\n\n'''Bulgaria''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u028cl\u02c8\u0261\u025b\u0259ri\u0259, b\u028al-/]] (listen); [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, <small>[[Romanization of Bulgarian|romanized]]:</small> ''Balgariya''), officially the '''Republic of Bulgaria''' (Bulgarian: \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, <small>romanized:</small> ''Republika Balgariya'', <small>IPA:</small> [[Help:IPA/Bulgarian|[r\u025b\u02c8publik\u0250 b\u0250\u026b\u02c8\u0261arij\u0250]]]), is a country in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|sixteenth-largest country]]. One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire]] lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy. Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]]. The population has declined since the late 1980s. Bulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. Bulgaria is a [[developing country]] and ranks 52nd in the [[Human Development Index]], the lowest development rank in the European Union alongside [[Romania]]. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.\n\n'''Burkina Faso''' (<small>[[British English|UK]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02ccki\u02d0n\u0259 \u02c8f\u00e6so\u028a/]], <small>[[American English|US]]:</small> [[Help:IPA/English|/- \u02c8f\u0251\u02d0so\u028a/]] (listen); <small>French:</small> [[Help:IPA/French|[bu\u0281kina faso]]]), officially the '''Republic of Burkina Faso''' ([[Mossi language|Mossi]]: ''Repibilik b\u00e1\u00e1ga Burk\u0129na Faso''), is a [[landlocked country]] in West Africa.

The July 2019 population estimate by the United Nations was 20,321,378. The country's official language of government and business is French. Roughly 50% of the population speaks the [[Mossi language]] natively. Formerly called the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] (1958\u20131984), the country was [[Geographical renaming|renamed]] \"Burkina Faso\" on 4 August 1984 by erstwhile President [[Thomas Sankara]]. Its citizens are known as ''Burkinab\u00e9'' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8ki\u02d0n\u0259be\u026a/]] [[Help:Pronunciation respelling key|''bur-KEE-n\u0259-bay'']]). Its capital is [[Ouagadougou]]. The [[Republic of Upper Volta]] was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]], and on 5 August 1960 it gained full independence, with [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]] as [[List of heads of state of Burkina Faso|President]]. After protests by students and labour union members, Yam\u00e9ogo was deposed in the [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]], who became President. His rule coincided with the [[Sahel drought]] and famine, and facing problems from the country's traditionally powerful trade unions he was deposed in the [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1980 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Saye Zerbo]]. Encountering resistance from trade unions again, Zerbo's government was overthrown in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1982 coup d'\u00e9tat]], led by [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]]. The leader of the leftist faction of Ou\u00e9draogo's government, [[Thomas Sankara]], was made [[List of Prime Ministers of Burkina Faso|Prime Minister]] but was later imprisoned. Efforts to free him led to the popularly-supported 1983 coup d'\u00e9tat, in which he became President. Sankara renamed the country Burkina Faso and launched an ambitious socioeconomic programme which included a nationwide [[literacy]] campaign, [[land redistribution]] to peasants, railway and road construction and the outlawing of [[female genital mutilation]], [[Forced marriage|forced marriages]] and [[polygamy]]. Sankara was overthrown and killed in the [[1987 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|1987 coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by [[Blaise Compaor\u00e9]] \u2013 deteriorating relations with former coloniser France and its ally the Ivory Coast were the reason given for the coup. In 1987, Blaise Compaor\u00e9 became president and, after an alleged [[1989 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1989 coup attempt]], was later elected in [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 1991|1991]] and [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 1998|1998]], elections which were boycotted by the opposition and received a considerably low turnout, as well as in [[Burkinab\u00e9 presidential election, 2005|2005]]. He remained head of state until he was ousted from power by the [[2014 Burkinab\u00e9 uprising|popular youth upheaval of 31 October 2014]], after which he was exiled to the Ivory Coast. [[Michel Kafando]] subsequently became the transitional president of the country. On 16 September 2015, [[2015 Burkinab\u00e9 coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Kafando government was carried out by the [[Regiment of Presidential Security]], the former presidential guard of Compaor\u00e9. On 24 September 2015, after pressure from the [[African Union]], [[ECOWAS]] and the armed forces, the military junta agreed to step down, and Michel Kafando was reinstated as acting president. In the [[Burkinab\u00e9 general election, 2015|general election held on 29 November 2015]], [[Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9]] won in the first round with 53.5% of the vote and was sworn in as President on 29 December 2015.\n\n'''Burundi''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/b\u0259\u02c8r\u028andi/]] (listen), [[Help:IPA/English|/-\u02c8r\u028cn-/]]), officially the '''Republic of Burundi''' ([[Kirundi language|Kirundi]]: ''Republika y'Uburundi'', [[Help:IPA|[u.\u03b2u.\u027e\u01d4\u02d0.ndi]]]; French: ''R\u00e9publique du Burundi'', [[Help:IPA/French|[bu\u0281undi]]] or [[Help:IPA/French|[by\u0281yndi]]]), is a [[landlocked country]] in the [[Great Rift Valley]] where the [[African Great Lakes]] region and [[East Africa]] converge. It is bordered by [[Rwanda]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the east and southeast, and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the west; [[Lake Tanganyika]] lies along its southwestern border. The capital cities are Gitega and Bujumbura. The [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples have lived in Burundi for at least 500 years. For more than 200 of those years, Burundi was an independent [[Kingdom of Burundi|kingdom]], until the beginning of the 20th century, when [[German Empire|Germany]] colonised the region. After the [[First World War]] and [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Germany's defeat]], it ceded the territory to [[Belgium]]. Both Germans and Belgians ruled Burundi and Rwanda as a European colony known as [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. Despite common misconceptions, Burundi and Rwanda had never been under common rule until the time of European colonisation. Burundi gained independence in 1962 and initially had a [[Kingdom of Burundi|monarchy]], but a series of assassinations, coups and a general climate of [[Congo Crisis|regional instability]] culminated in the establishment of a republic and one-party state in 1966. Bouts of [[ethnic cleansing]] and ultimately two civil wars and genocides during the [[Burundian Genocide#1972|1970s]] and again in the [[Burundian Civil War|1990s]] left the [[Developing country|economy undeveloped]] and the population as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|world's poorest]]. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994. 2015 witnessed [[2015 Burundian unrest|large-scale political strife]] as President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] opted to run for a third term in office, a [[2015 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|coup attempt failed]] and the country's [[Burundian legislative election, 2015|parliamentary]] and [[Burundian presidential election, 2015|presidential]] elections were broadly criticised by members of the international community. The [[sovereign state]] of Burundi's political system is that of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic based upon a multi-party state. The President of Burundi is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. There are currently 21 [[List of political parties in Burundi|registered parties in Burundi]]. On 13 March 1992, Tutsi coup leader [[Pierre Buyoya]] established a constitution, which provided for a multi-party political process and reflected multi-party competition. Six years later, on 6 June 1998, the constitution was changed, broadening [[National Assembly of Burundi|National Assembly]]'s seats and making provisions for two vice-presidents. Because of the [[Arusha Accords (Burundi)|Arusha Accord]], Burundi enacted a transitional government in 2000. In October 2016, Burundi informed the UN of its intention to withdraw from the [[International Criminal Court]]. Burundi remains primarily a rural society, with just 13.4% of the population living in urban areas in 2019. The population density of around 315 people per square kilometre (753 per sq mi) is the second highest in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Roughly 85% of the population are of [[Hutu]] ethnic origin, 15% are [[Tutsi]], and fewer than 1% are indigenous [[Twa]]. The [[Official language|official languages]] of Burundi are [[Kirundi language|Kirundi]], [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]], Kirundi being recognised officially as the sole national language. One of the smallest countries in Africa, Burundi's land is used mostly for subsistence agricultural and grazing, which has led to [[deforestation]], [[soil erosion]] and [[habitat loss]]. As of 2005 the country was almost completely deforested, with less than 6% of its land covered by trees and over half of that being commmercial plantations. In addition to poverty, Burundians often have to deal with corruption, weak infrastructure, poor access to health and education services, and hunger. Burundi is densely populated and many young people emigrate in search of opportunities elsewhere. The [[World Happiness Report|World Happiness Report 2018]] ranked Burundi as the world's least happy nation with a rank of 156.\n\n'''C\u00f4te d'Ivoire''', officially the '''Republic of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire''', is a country located on the south coast of [[West Africa]]. Ivory Coast's political capital is [[Yamoussoukro]] in the centre of the country, while its economic capital and largest city is the port city of [[Abidjan]]. It borders [[Guinea]] to [[Guinea\u2013Ivory Coast border|the northwest]], [[Liberia]] to [[Ivory Coast\u2013Liberia border|the west]], [[Mali]] to [[Ivory Coast\u2013Mali border|the northwest]], [[Burkina Faso]] to [[Burkina Faso\u2013Ivory Coast border|the northeast]], [[Ghana]] to [[Ghana\u2013Ivory Coast border|the east]], and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] (Atlantic Ocean) to the south. The [[official language]] of the republic is [[French language|French]], with local indigenous languages also being widely used that include [[Baoul\u00e9 language|Baoul\u00e9]], [[Dioula language|Dioula]], [[Dan language|Dan]], [[Anyin language|Anyin]], and [[Senari languages|Cebaara Senufo]]. In total, there are around 78 different [[Languages of Ivory Coast|languages spoken in Ivory Coast]]. The country has large populations of [[Islam in Ivory Coast|Muslims]], [[Christianity in Ivory Coast|Christians]] (primarily [[Roman Catholicism in Ivory Coast|Roman Catholics]]) and [[Religion in Ivory Coast|various indigenous religions]]. Before its colonization by Europeans, Ivory Coast was home to several states, including [[Gyaaman]], the [[Kong Empire]] and [[Baoul\u00e9 people|Baoul\u00e9]]. The area became a [[protectorate]] of France in 1843 and was consolidated as a [[French colony]] in 1893 amid the European [[scramble for Africa]]. It achieved independence in 1960, led by [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny]], who ruled the country until 1993. Relatively stable by regional standards, Ivory Coast established close political and economic ties with its West African neighbors while at the same time maintaining close relations to [[Western Bloc|the West]], [[Fran\u00e7afrique|especially France]]. Ivory Coast experienced a [[1999 Ivorian coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat in 1999]] and two religiously-grounded civil wars, first [[First Ivorian Civil War|between 2002 and 2007]] and again [[Second Ivorian Civil War|during 2010\u20132011]]. In 2000, the country adopted a new [[constitution]]. Ivory Coast is a republic with strong executive power vested in its [[President of Ivory Coast|president]]. Through the production of [[Coffee bean|coffee]] and [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], the country was an economic powerhouse in West Africa during the 1960s and 1970s, though it went through an economic crisis in the 1980s, contributing to a period of political and social turmoil. It was not until around 2014 that the [[gross domestic product]] again reached the level of its peak in the 1970s. In the 21st century, the Ivorian economy has been largely market-based, and it still relies heavily on agriculture, with [[Smallholding|smallholder]] cash-crop production being predominant.\n\n'''Cape Verde''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rd(i)/]] (listen)) or '''Cabo Verde''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/\u02cck\u0251\u02d0bo\u028a \u02c8v\u025c\u02d0rde\u026a/]] (listen), [[Help:IPA/English|/\u02cck\u00e6b-/]]) ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Cabo Verde'', pronounced [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[\u02c8kabu \u02c8ve\u027ed\u0268]]]), officially the '''Republic of Cabo Verde''', is an [[island country]] spanning an [[archipelago]] of 10 [[High island|volcanic islands]] in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It forms part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]], along with the [[Azores]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. Located 570 kilometres (350 mi) west of the [[Cape Verde Peninsula]] off the coast of [[Northwest Africa]], the islands cover a combined area of 4,033 square kilometres (1,557 sq mi). The Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers discovered and [[Colony|colonized]] the islands, establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Ideally located for the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, [[Privateer|privateers]], and [[Piracy|pirates]]. The end of [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery]] in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration. Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes. Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951, the islands continued to campaign for independence, which was achieved in 1975. Since the early 1990s, Cape Verde has been a stable [[representative democracy]], and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa. Lacking natural resources, its developing economy is mostly service-oriented, with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment. Its population of around 550,000 (as at mid 2019) is mostly of mixed [[Africa|African]], [[Moorish]], [[Arab]] and [[Europe|European]] heritage, and predominantly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule. A [[Cape Verdean diaspora|sizeable diaspora community]] exists across the world, slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands. Historically, the name \"Cape Verde\" has been used in English for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the Cape Verdean government determined that the Portuguese designation ''Cabo Verde'' would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at the [[United Nations]], even in English contexts. Cape Verde is a member of the [[African Union]].\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n{{Rough translation|listed=yes|date=April 2020}}\nDr. Padumlal Punnalal Bakshi (27 May 1894 - 28 December 1971), also known as Masterji<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2_%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%96%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%80|title=\u092a\u0926\u0941\u092e\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092a\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u0916\u094d\u0936\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u0915\u093f\u092a\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u093e|website=hi.m.wikipedia.org|language=hi|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>, was a [[Hindi]] essayist.
