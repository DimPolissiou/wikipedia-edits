It was designed in two stages, by [[John Whitton]] as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, in 1870; and by engineering staff of [[New South Wales Government Railways]] in 1921; and was built from 1870 to 1921. It is also known as '''Farmers Creek viaducts'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1028>{{cite NSW SHR|5011947|Bowenfels Rail Viaducts|hr=01028|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref> The viaduct are located approximately {{convert|159|km}} west of [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central railway station]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Farmers Creek stone railway viaduct, immediately upstream of the 1921 brick viaduct, was built for the [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] single-track railway extension, 1869 - 1875. It is one of the oldest railway arch bridges in New South Wales but was bypassed by the 1921 double-track brick arch bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nBy the early 1900s the original single track from Bowenfels to [[Wallerawang]] was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves.<ref name=nswshr-1028/> John Whitton chose to use stone arch construction when denied sufficient funds to use imported wrought iron girders. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build single track bridges. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of large brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1028/> The quantity of bricks used in the program was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nThe Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nThe viaducts over Farmers Creek are accessible from a local road that was the original [[Great Western Highway]].<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\n== Description ==\n===1870 rail viaduct===\nA [[sandstone]] viaduct built for the original single track Great Western Railway over Farmers Creek west of Bowenfels Railway Station.

Economic constraints forced Whitton to build single track bridges. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of large brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1028/> The quantity of bricks used in the program was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nThe Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\nThe viaducts over Farmers Creek are accessible from a local road that was the original [[Great Western Highway]].<ref name=nswshr-1028/>\n\n== Description ==\n===1870 rail viaduct===\nA [[sandstone]] viaduct built for the original single track Great Western Railway over Farmers Creek west of Bowenfels Railway Station.

Nagar Haveli was one of the parganas, and its capital was Silvassa.\n\nIn 1360 Rana Dharamshah I shifted his capital from Nagar Haveli to Nagar Fatehpur.\n\nWith the rise of [[Maratha]] power, Shivaji viewed Ramnagar as an important locality. He captured the region, but Somshah Rana recaptured it in 1690.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Vasai (6 May 1739), Vasai and the surrounding territories came under the Maratha rule.<ref name=\"penguin\">The Penguin Guide to the States & Union Territories of India, 2007</ref>\n\nSoon after, the Marathas captured Ramnagar but reinstated the ruler, Ramdeo, under conditions. Thus the Marathas acquired the rights to collect revenue, known as ''chauthai''. from Nagar Haveli and two other paraganas.\n\nDuring the time of Dharamdeo, the son of Ramdeo, due to his change of policies (he neglected the conditions imposed earlier by the Marathas), the Marathas captured Nagar Haveli and the surrounding region.\n\n===Portuguese era===\n{{Main|Portuguese India}}\n[[File:Dam\u00e3o, Dadra, Nagar Haveli.png|thumb|Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the Portuguese period]]\nThe Portuguese were granted the area of Nagar Haveli on 10 June 1783 on the basis of Friendship Treaty executed on 17 December 1779 as compensation towards damage to the Portuguese frigate Santana by [[Maratha Navy]] in 1772.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nair|first=Rajeshwary|title=Study of Ethnobotanical Plants of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Their Significance to the Tribes|journal=Life Sciences Leaflets|date=1 October 2011|page=7|issn=0976-1098|url=http://api.ning.com/files/L*EC3kOB8rEqeDrTd-zaT3pnMEknAzeJwJoj61eEXX7WuoM2BcxLQoDxNf-lOY8ZEqP7DyPt7CGtyD1vdEB9gqFCmjHwO6MT/872.STUDYOFETHNOBOTANICALPLANTSOFDADRAANDNAGARHAVELIANDTHEIRSIGNIFICANCETOTHETRIBESByRAJESHWARYNAIR.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203082007/http://api.ning.com/files/L*EC3kOB8rEqeDrTd-zaT3pnMEknAzeJwJoj61eEXX7WuoM2BcxLQoDxNf-lOY8ZEqP7DyPt7CGtyD1vdEB9gqFCmjHwO6MT/872.STUDYOFETHNOBOTANICALPLANTSOFDADRAANDNAGARHAVELIANDTHEIRSIGNIFICANCETOTHETRIBESByRAJESHWARYNAIR.pdf|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The treaty allowed the Portuguese to collect revenue from 72 villages in Nagar Haveli. Then, in 1785 the Portuguese purchased Dadra, annexing it to Portuguese India (Estado Portugu\u00eas da \u00cdndia).\n\nIn 1818, the [[Maratha Empire]] was defeated by the British in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], and the Portuguese ultimately became the effective rulers of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\n\nUnder the Portuguese rule, Dadra and Nagar Haveli were part of the ''Distrito de Dam\u00e3o'' ([[Daman district, India|Daman district]]) of the ''[[Estado da \u00cdndia]]'' (Portuguese State of India). The two territories formed a single ''[[concelho]]'' (municipality), named \"Nagar Haveli\", with its head in Darar\u00e1 until 1885 and, after that, with its head in the town of [[Silvassa]]. The local affairs were overseen by an elected ''c\u00e2mara municipal'' (municipal council), with the higher level affairs administrated by the district governor of Daman, who was represented in Nagar Haveli by an administrator.\n\nThe Nagar Haveli ''concelho'' was itself divided in the following ''[[freguesia]]''s ([[civil parish]]es): Silvassa, Noroli, Dadra, Quelalunim, Rand\u00e1, Darar\u00e1, Cadoli, Canoel, Carchonde, and Sindonim.\n\nThe Portuguese rule lasted until 1954, when Dadra and Nagar Haveli were captured by supporters of the Indian Union. It was the first colony to be detached from the Empire by the occupation of the Indian Union in 1954, after nearly two centuries of Portuguese rule.\n\n===End of Portuguese rule===\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli}}\nAfter India attained Independence in 1947, the residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the help of volunteers of organisations like the United Front of Goans (UFG), the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), and the Azad Gomantak Dal, conquered the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from [[Portuguese India]] in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, ''Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present'', published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref>\n\nAs time passed the Indian Independence Struggle picked up momentum. On 18 June 1946, Ram Manohar Lohia was arrested in Goa. This was the beginning of the Independence struggle in Goa. He was deported to India. On 15 August 1947, India became independent from the British rule, but the Portuguese and other European colonies were not immediately incorporated.\n\nThe Goan struggle continued for many years. Atmaram Narsinh Karmalkar, an officer in the Banco Colonial (Portuguese Bank) at Pananji (in Goa) (then known as Panjim), who was popularly known as Appasaheb Karmalkar was indirectly involved in the freedom struggle in Goa. He was dismissed from the bank and finally took up the struggle to liberate Goa. In course of time he realised that liberation of DNH was crucial if Goa was to be liberated. Karmalkar reached Vapi and met Jayantibhai Desai from Dadra. He also met Bhikubhai Pandya from Nani Daman and Vanmali Bhavsar from Silvassa.\n\nAzad Gomantak Dal under the leadership of Vishwanath Lavande, Dattatreya Deshpande, Prabhakar Sinar and others,  Communist Party under the leadership of Shamrao Parulekar and Godavaribai Parulekar, and the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas, J.M. D'Souza, Waman Desai and others were also attempting the liberation of DNH.\n\nOn 18 June 1954, many leaders met at Lavaccha. Lavaccha and Vapi were Indian territories. The order in which these places are lying (from east to west) is Nagar Haveli, Lavaccha, Dadra, Vapi and Daman (on the sea coast). So the Portuguese officers required transit permit through Indian territories of Lavaccha and Vapi to travel between N.H, Dadra, and Daman.\n\nOn the night of 22 July 1954, 15 volunteers of the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas and Waman Desai sneaked into the territory of Dadra and reached the police station. There were only three personnel at the police station. One was attacked with a knife by one of the volunteers and the other two were overpowered. The Indian tricolour was hoisted and the Indian National Anthem was sung. Dadra was declared \"Free territory of Dadra\".\n\nOn the night of 28 July, around 30 to 35 volunteers of Azad Gomantak Dal proceeded to Naroli from Karambele (Karambeli) by swimming across the rivulets. June to September is the rainy season in the region and the rivers are usually flooded during this season. The Daman Ganga river was flooded and no help could reach Naroli. This was the reason to choose this date for proceeding to Naroli. There were only six police personnel. The volunteers and the villages reached the police station and asked them to surrender or face death. They immediately surrendered. The Portuguese rule of Naroli came to an end.\n\nThe Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory did not intervene. J.D. Nagarwala, the Dy. Inspector General of the Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory, without entering DNH asked Captain Fidalgo, the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to surrender to the Indian Forces along with his paramilitary forces before they would be butchered by the liberators.\n\nLeaving about 50 policemen and five civilian officers posted at Silvassa, Captain Fidalgo fled to Udva passing through Rakholi, Dappada, and Khanvel and surrendered to the SRP on 11 August. They were later allowed to go to Goa.\n\nIn the meanwhile, there were several rumours and the officers at Silvassa were in confusion. On 1 August the liberators took advantage of the situation and proceeded from Dadra and Naroli and liberated Pipariya. The five police officers surrendered without resistance.\n\nDuring the night the volunteers divided themselves into three batches and reached the police chowky at Silvassa. The police Chowky at Silvassa was protected by sandbags. There were three policemen guarding from three sides. Vasant Badve, Vishnu Bhople, and Shantaram Vaidya overpowered them from behind when least expected. The other policemen surrendered without resistance on seeing the other volunteers. The volunteers spent the night awake at the police [[chowky]].\n\nIn the morning of 2 August 1954, the liberators reached the town of Silvassa to find it free of any Portuguese occupation. The liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli was complete.\n\nSenhor Luis de Gama, the eldest nationalist hoisted the Indian National Flag and declared the territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli liberated and the Indian National Anthem was sung.\n\n===Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli===\n[[File:Dadra-Nagarhaveli 1956.jpg|thumb|Old map of the territory.]]\nFrom 1954 to 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed as a ''de facto'' state known as [[Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli]].

The employment generation is increasing at the pace of 5% per annum.\n\nIndustrialisation in the area began in 1965 when the first industrial unit in the UT was started at Piparia, Silvassa in the cooperative sector by Dan Udyog Sahakari Sangh Ltd, following which three industrial estates were established at Masat (1976), Khadoli (1982) and Silvassa (1985). Earlier (before 1965) only traditional craftsmen who made clay pots, leather items, viz., chappals, shoes and some other items of bamboo were present. Since there was no sales tax in the UT, it attracted many entrepreneurs. Around 30 new units comprising Engineering, fabric weaving units and dyeing and printing units were established until 1970.\n\nIn 1971, UT was declared as industrially backward area by [[Government of India]] and increased the cash subsidy to 15 to 25% for the industrial units on their capital investment which resulted in the speedy industrial development. The scheme was however terminated from 30 September 1988. Sales Tax Act was implemented from January 1984 until 1998 under which industries enjoyed sales tax exemption for 15 years from the start-up date. [[VAT]] was introduced in 2005. At present, the newly established units get Central Sales Tax exemption which will continue until 2017.<ref name=\"dnh_ind\" />\n\nThere are more than 2710 units functioning providing employment to about 46000 people with a capital investment of {{INRConvert|377.8310|m}}.<ref name=\"socio-eco\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n|-\n| Small scale industries || 2118\n|-\n| Medium scale industries|| 564\n|-\n|Large scale industries|| 28\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 343,709.<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 30 September 2011 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110611224943/http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | archive-date = 11 June 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 1 October 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165947/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | archive-date = 27 September 2011 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This gives it a ranking of 566th in India, out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]] districts.<ref name=districtcensus/> It has a population density of {{convert|698|PD/sqkm|PD/sqmi}}, and its [[Family planning in India|population growth rate]] over the decade from 2001 to 2011 was 55.5 percent, which is the highest percentage growth among all Indian states and union territories.<ref name=districtcensus/><ref name=statecensus>{{cite web | url=http://www.census2011.co.in/staest.php | title = State Census 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of 775 [[Women in India|females]] for every 1,000 males, and a [[Literacy in India|literacy rate]] of 77.65%.<ref name=districtcensus/>\n\n== Ethnography, religion and language ==\nTribal groups make up a large part of the population viz 62%.

Dhodias and Dubles mainly populate the Northern part, whereas Koknas and Warlis are found all over the Union Territory. They worship the primary deities of Dis (Sun) and Chand (Moon), and Narandev, Kanasari, Himai, Hirva, Veer, Rangtai and Vagdev.\n\nOne prominent feature of this territory is that people from all over India form a part of non-tribal residents. DNH has many industries due to tax concessions granted to industry and therefore people from all over the country have migrated to the region.\nNorth Indians have a prime influence in the area. Gujarati is one of the three official languages, the others being Hindi and English. Besides Gujarati persons, one can find Marathi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Tamil, Uttar Pradeshi and people from several other states. The prime reason for such diverse population is the industrial hub. Employment opportunities, good climate, and the landscape are highly appealing.\n\nPer the 2001 Census, out of the 137,225 ST persons of the UT, almost all were Hindus except for 3,796 Christians (2.8%).<ref name=\"census 2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/States_at_glance/State_Links/26_dnh.pdf|title=Dadra & Nagar Haveli (26): Housing Profile|work=Census 2001|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=19 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930122148/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/States_at_glance/State_Links/26_dnh.pdf|archive-date=30 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As a former Portuguese enclave, [[Silvassa]] has a significant Roman Catholic population.

Their main deities are Naran dev, Hirwa, Himai, and Waghio, and stone images of these deities are found in tree groves. A Bhagat plays the Ghangal (a musical instrument made from gourd, bamboo and iron strings) and performs the rituals.\n\nTraditionally the Warlis wear a loin cloth with a small waist coat and a turban.

In the year 1262 a [[Rajput]] prince from [[Rajasthan]] named Ramsinh established himself as the ruler of Ramnagar, the present-day [[Dharampur State|Dharampur]], which consisted of 8 [[pargana]]s (group of villages) and assumed the title Maharana. Nagar Haveli was one of the parganas, and its capital was Silvassa.\n\nIn 1360 Rana Dharamshah I shifted his capital from Nagar Haveli to Nagar Fatehpur.\n\nWith the rise of [[Maratha]] power, Shivaji viewed Ramnagar as an important locality. He captured the region, but Somshah Rana recaptured it in 1690.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Vasai (6 May 1739), Vasai and the surrounding territories came under the Maratha rule.<ref name=\"penguin\">The Penguin Guide to the States & Union Territories of India, 2007</ref>\n\nSoon after, the Marathas captured Ramnagar but reinstated the ruler, Ramdeo, under conditions. Thus the Marathas acquired the rights to collect revenue, known as ''chauthai''. from Nagar Haveli and two other paraganas.\n\nDuring the time of Dharamdeo, the son of Ramdeo, due to his change of policies (he neglected the conditions imposed earlier by the Marathas), the Marathas captured Nagar Haveli and the surrounding region.\n\n===Portuguese era===\n{{Main|Portuguese India}}\n[[File:Dam\u00e3o, Dadra, Nagar Haveli.png|thumb|Daman, Dadra and Nagar Haveli during the Portuguese period]]\nThe Portuguese were granted the area of Nagar Haveli on 10 June 1783 on the basis of Friendship Treaty executed on 17 December 1779 as compensation towards damage to the Portuguese frigate Santana by [[Maratha Navy]] in 1772.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Nair|first=Rajeshwary|title=Study of Ethnobotanical Plants of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Their Significance to the Tribes|journal=Life Sciences Leaflets|date=1 October 2011|page=7|issn=0976-1098|url=http://api.ning.com/files/L*EC3kOB8rEqeDrTd-zaT3pnMEknAzeJwJoj61eEXX7WuoM2BcxLQoDxNf-lOY8ZEqP7DyPt7CGtyD1vdEB9gqFCmjHwO6MT/872.STUDYOFETHNOBOTANICALPLANTSOFDADRAANDNAGARHAVELIANDTHEIRSIGNIFICANCETOTHETRIBESByRAJESHWARYNAIR.pdf|accessdate=25 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203082007/http://api.ning.com/files/L*EC3kOB8rEqeDrTd-zaT3pnMEknAzeJwJoj61eEXX7WuoM2BcxLQoDxNf-lOY8ZEqP7DyPt7CGtyD1vdEB9gqFCmjHwO6MT/872.STUDYOFETHNOBOTANICALPLANTSOFDADRAANDNAGARHAVELIANDTHEIRSIGNIFICANCETOTHETRIBESByRAJESHWARYNAIR.pdf|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The treaty allowed the Portuguese to collect revenue from 72 villages in Nagar Haveli. Then, in 1785 the Portuguese purchased Dadra, annexing it to Portuguese India (Estado Portugu\u00eas da \u00cdndia).\n\nIn 1818, the [[Maratha Empire]] was defeated by the British in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], and the Portuguese ultimately became the effective rulers of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.\n\nUnder the Portuguese rule, Dadra and Nagar Haveli were part of the ''Distrito de Dam\u00e3o'' ([[Daman district, India|Daman district]]) of the ''[[Estado da \u00cdndia]]'' (Portuguese State of India). The two territories formed a single ''[[concelho]]'' (municipality), named \"Nagar Haveli\", with its head in Darar\u00e1 until 1885 and, after that, with its head in the town of [[Silvassa]]. The local affairs were overseen by an elected ''c\u00e2mara municipal'' (municipal council), with the higher level affairs administrated by the district governor of Daman, who was represented in Nagar Haveli by an administrator.\n\nThe Nagar Haveli ''concelho'' was itself divided in the following ''[[freguesia]]''s ([[civil parish]]es): Silvassa, Noroli, Dadra, Quelalunim, Rand\u00e1, Darar\u00e1, Cadoli, Canoel, Carchonde, and Sindonim.\n\nThe Portuguese rule lasted until 1954, when Dadra and Nagar Haveli were captured by supporters of the Indian Union. It was the first colony to be detached from the Empire by the occupation of the Indian Union in 1954, after nearly two centuries of Portuguese rule.\n\n===End of Portuguese rule===\n{{Main|Indian annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli}}\nAfter India attained Independence in 1947, the residents of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, with the help of volunteers of organisations like the United Front of Goans (UFG),  the National Movement Liberation Organisation (NMLO), and the Azad Gomantak Dal, conquered the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from [[Portuguese India]] in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, ''Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present'', published by Usha P. Lele, 1987</ref>\n\nAs time passed the Indian Independence Struggle picked up momentum. On 18 June 1946, Ram Manohar Lohia was arrested in Goa. This was the beginning of the Independence struggle in Goa. He was deported to India. On 15 August 1947, India became independent from the British rule, but the Portuguese and other European colonies were not immediately incorporated.\n\nThe Goan struggle continued for many years. Atmaram Narsinh Karmalkar, an officer in the Banco Colonial (Portuguese Bank) at Pananji (in Goa) (then known as Panjim), who was popularly known as Appasaheb Karmalkar was indirectly involved in the freedom struggle in Goa. He was dismissed from the bank and finally took up the struggle to liberate Goa. In course of time he realised that liberation of DNH was crucial if Goa was to be liberated. Karmalkar reached Vapi and met Jayantibhai Desai from Dadra. He also met Bhikubhai Pandya from Nani Daman and Vanmali Bhavsar from Silvassa.\n\nAzad Gomantak Dal under the leadership of Vishwanath Lavande, Dattatreya Deshpande, Prabhakar Sinar and others,  Communist Party under the leadership of Shamrao Parulekar and Godavaribai Parulekar, and the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas, J.M. D'Souza, Waman Desai and others were also attempting the liberation of DNH.\n\nOn 18 June 1954, many leaders met at Lavaccha. Lavaccha and Vapi were Indian territories. The order in which these places are lying (from east to west) is Nagar Haveli, Lavaccha, Dadra, Vapi and Daman (on the sea coast). So the Portuguese officers required transit permit through Indian territories of Lavaccha and Vapi to travel between N.H, Dadra, and Daman.\n\nOn the night of 22 July 1954, 15 volunteers of the United Front of Goans under the leadership of Francis Mascerenhas and Waman Desai sneaked into the territory of Dadra and reached the police station. There were only three personnel at the police station. One was attacked with a knife by one of the volunteers and the other two were overpowered. The Indian tricolour was hoisted and the Indian National Anthem was sung. Dadra was declared \"Free territory of Dadra\".\n\nOn the night of 28 July, around 30 to 35 volunteers of Azad Gomantak Dal proceeded to Naroli from Karambele (Karambeli) by swimming across the rivulets. June to September is the rainy season in the region and the rivers are usually flooded during this season. The Daman Ganga river was flooded and no help could reach Naroli. This was the reason to choose this date for proceeding to Naroli. There were only six police personnel. The volunteers and the villages reached the police station and asked them to surrender or face death. They immediately surrendered. The Portuguese rule of Naroli came to an end.\n\nThe Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory did not intervene. J.D. Nagarwala, the Dy. Inspector General of the Special Reserve Police in the Indian Territory, without entering DNH asked Captain Fidalgo, the Administrator of Dadra and Nagar Haveli to surrender to the Indian Forces along with his paramilitary forces before they would be butchered by the liberators.\n\nLeaving about 50 policemen and five civilian officers posted at Silvassa, Captain Fidalgo fled to Udva passing through Rakholi, Dappada, and Khanvel and surrendered to the SRP on 11 August. They were later allowed to go to Goa.\n\nIn the meanwhile, there were several rumours and the officers at Silvassa were in confusion. On 1 August the liberators took advantage of the situation and proceeded from Dadra and Naroli and liberated Pipariya. The five police officers surrendered without resistance.\n\nDuring the night the volunteers divided themselves into three batches and reached the police chowky at Silvassa. The police Chowky at Silvassa was protected by sandbags. There were three policemen guarding from three sides. Vasant Badve, Vishnu Bhople, and Shantaram Vaidya overpowered them from behind when least expected. The other policemen surrendered without resistance on seeing the other volunteers. The volunteers spent the night awake at the police [[chowky]].\n\nIn the morning of 2 August 1954, the liberators reached the town of Silvassa to find it free of any Portuguese occupation. The liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli was complete.\n\nSenhor Luis de Gama, the eldest nationalist hoisted the Indian National Flag and declared the territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli liberated and the Indian National Anthem was sung.\n\n===Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli===\n[[File:Dadra-Nagarhaveli 1956.jpg|thumb|Old map of the territory.]]\nFrom 1954 to 1961, Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed as a ''de facto'' state known as [[Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli]].

Due to heavy industrialisation in the region owing to tax stops for industries in the union territories, steady growth in employment has been observed. The employment generation is increasing at the pace of 5% per annum.\n\nIndustrialisation in the area began in 1965 when the first industrial unit in the UT was started at Piparia, Silvassa in the cooperative sector by  Dan Udyog Sahakari Sangh Ltd, following which three industrial estates were established at Masat (1976), Khadoli (1982) and Silvassa (1985). Earlier (before 1965) only traditional craftsmen who made clay pots, leather items, viz., chappals, shoes and some other items of bamboo were present. Since there was no sales tax in the UT, it attracted many entrepreneurs. Around 30 new units comprising Engineering, fabric weaving units and dyeing and printing units were established until 1970.\n\nIn 1971, UT was declared as industrially backward area by [[Government of India]] and increased the cash subsidy to 15 to 25% for the industrial units on their capital investment which resulted in the speedy industrial development.

The most prominent are Dhodia (16.90%), Kokna (16.85%) and Warli (62.94%), with small groups of [[Koli People|Koli]], Kathodi, Naika, and Dubla scattered across the territory, collectively representing 3.31% of the population. Dhodias and Dubles mainly populate the Northern part, whereas Koknas and Warlis are found all over the Union Territory. They worship the primary deities of Dis (Sun) and Chand (Moon), and Narandev, Kanasari, Himai, Hirva, Veer, Rangtai and Vagdev.\n\nOne prominent feature of this territory is that people from all over India form a part of non-tribal residents. DNH has many industries due to tax concessions granted to industry and therefore people from all over the country have migrated to the region.\nNorth Indians have a prime influence in the area. Gujarati is one of the three official languages, the others being Hindi and English. Besides Gujarati persons, one can find Marathi, Rajasthani, Bihari, Tamil, Uttar Pradeshi and people from several other states. The prime reason for such diverse population is the industrial hub. Employment opportunities, good climate, and the landscape are highly appealing.\n\nPer the 2001 Census, out of the 137,225 ST persons of the UT, almost all were Hindus except for 3,796 Christians (2.8%).<ref name=\"census 2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/States_at_glance/State_Links/26_dnh.pdf|title=Dadra & Nagar Haveli (26): Housing Profile|work=Census 2001|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=19 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930122148/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/States_at_glance/State_Links/26_dnh.pdf|archive-date=30 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As a former Portuguese enclave, [[Silvassa]] has a significant Roman Catholic population.

The tribal communities are locally known as Adivasi (which means original inhabitant). Each community has its own culture, traditions and languages and dialects. None of these languages has written literature or script until today. The tribal communities consist of approximately 60% of the population of DNH. (Earlier in the eighties it was more than 80%, but after influx from different parts of the country, the percentage has reduced). But the influx has helped the tribal people in increasing their earnings and standard of living.\n\n[[Varli language|Warli]] is the language spoken by the Warli people.

Their main deities are Naran dev, Hirwa, Himai, and Waghio, and stone images of these deities are found in tree groves. A Bhagat plays the Ghangal (a musical instrument made from gourd, bamboo and iron strings) and performs the rituals.\n\nTraditionally the Warlis wear a loin cloth with a small waist coat and a turban.

Some own enough farmland to be able to earn a decent livelihood.\n\nTraditionally the men wear a white knee-length dhoti with a shirt or waistcoat, white or coloured caps and ornaments like earrings and silver chains around their waist. The women wear a knee-length dark blue saree with an ''aanchal'' worn from the front and left loose at the back. Popular accessories include colourful bead necklaces, and metal ornaments such as bangles or thick ''kadas'' around their ankles.<ref name=tribe />\n\n===Kokna===\nThe Koknas derive their name from the Konkan region in West India.

Their name is derived from their profession of kattha or catechew making.\n\nThey are considered to be at the bottom of the tribal social ladder. They usually live in forests, in semi-permanent settlements. Most of them cut wood and collect charcoal.

The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 21 July 1971, launched on 24 January 1972 and completed on 20 April 1972. At 232,134 [[deadweight tonnage|tons deadweight]], the single-hulled ''Ujigawa Maru'' was classified as a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|319.3|m|ft|0}} and a beam of {{convert|53|m|ft|0}}. The ship was propelled by a single fixed pitch propeller driven by a {{convert|36000|hp|kW|abbr=on}} double-reduction steam turbine, giving it a service speed of {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=\"seaweb_worldsaga\" /> \n\nIn 1977, ''Ujigawa Maru'' was acquired by Fawley Tankers Ltd (today part of [[BW Group]]) and renamed ''World Saga''.<ref name=\"seaweb_worldsaga\" /> \n\n=== 1982\u20132006 ===\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Canadian Marine Drilling]] (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of [[Dome Petroleum]], purchased ''World Saga'' with the intention of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized [[drillship]]s that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and [[dynamic positioning]] systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use [[artificial island]]s, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson-retained]] islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.<ref name=\"hippman\">Hippman, A. and Kelly, W.

The ship was [[keel laying|laid down]] on 21 July 1971, launched on 24 January 1972 and completed on 20 April 1972. At 232,134 [[deadweight tonnage|tons deadweight]], the single-hulled ''Ujigawa Maru'' was classified as a very large crude carrier (VLCC) with an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|319.3|m|ft|0}} and a beam of {{convert|53|m|ft|0}}. The ship was propelled by a single fixed pitch propeller driven by a {{convert|36000|hp|kW|abbr=on}} double-reduction steam turbine, giving it a service speed of {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=\"seaweb_worldsaga\" /> \n\nIn 1977, ''Ujigawa Maru'' was acquired by Fawley Tankers Ltd (today part of [[BW Group]]) and renamed ''World Saga''.<ref name=\"seaweb_worldsaga\" /> \n\n=== 1982\u20132006 ===\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[Canadian Marine Drilling]] (Canmar), the drilling subsidiary of [[Dome Petroleum]], purchased ''World Saga'' with the intention of converting the oil tanker to an ice-resistant mobile offshore drilling unit that could continue exploratory drilling operations in the Beaufort Sea beyond the short open-water season. Previously, the company had utilized [[drillship]]s that had been winterized for arctic conditions, but existing mooring and [[dynamic positioning]] systems could not keep the vessel in place in moving first-year ice. This limited station-keeping ability shortened the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea to about 100 days which was not sufficient to drill and test a typical well within one summer season. An alternative approach was to use [[artificial island]]s, either dredged islands with gradually sloping sides or sand-filled concrete structures resting on a subsea gravel berm. While [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson-retained]] islands were considered to be the most appropriate and cost-effective way to extend the drilling season in the Beaufort Sea, relocating them was time-consuming and expensive as the structure had to be completely reconstructed every time it was moved to a new drilling location. The new drilling unit was intended to overcome these limitations.<ref name=\"hippman\">Hippman, A. and Kelly, W.
