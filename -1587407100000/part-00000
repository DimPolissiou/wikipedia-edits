This usage by a non-noble was tolerated so that he would continue to gain access to the court during the long regency of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] (who was only eight years old at the death of his father). Champlain received the official title of \"lieutenant\" (adjunct representative) of whichever noble was designated as Viceroy of [[New France]], the first being [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. From 1629 Champlain was named \"commandant\" under the authority of the King Minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. It was Champlain's successor, [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny]], who was the first to be formally named as the governor of New France, when he moved to Quebec City in 1636 and became the first noble to live there in that century.</ref> He established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley until his death, in 1635.\n\nChamplain is memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", with many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America bearing his name, most notably [[Lake Champlain]].\n\n==Birth year, location and family==\n[[File:Samuel-de-champlain-s.jpg|thumb|right|Inauthentic depiction of Champlain,<br />by [[Th\u00e9ophile Hamel]] (1870),<br />after the one by Ducornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1856),<br /> based on a portrait of [[Michel Particelli d'Emery]] ([[death|d.]] 1650)<br />by Balthasar Moncornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1668).<br />\u2014 No authentic portrait of Champlain is known to exist.<ref>[[#Bishop1948|Bishop (1948)]], pp 6\u20137</ref>|alt=A half-length portrait of a man, set against a background that is a red curtain to the left and a landscape scene to the right.

Although L\u00e9opold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of ''l'Acad\u00e9mie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle'') wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet's estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous [[monuments]] dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate. In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain's birth year and concluded, \"Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France.\"<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], p. 236</ref> Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\nChamplain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be ''Saintongeois'' in the title of his second book (1613). He belonged to either a [[Protestant]] family, or a tolerant [[Roman Catholic]] one, since Brouage was most of the time a Catholic city in a Protestant region, and his [[Old Testament]] first name ([[Samuel]]) was not usually given to Catholic children.<ref group=Note name=\"Laberge\">According to many modern historians, including Alain Laberge, the 2008 Chair of the History Department at [[Quebec City]]'s [[Laval University]], a specialist in the history of New France, Champlain could have been born a [[Protestant]]. A guest on the 6 February 2008 [[CBC Radio|CBC]] radio programme, ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', Professor Laberge said that the fact of Champlain's Protestantism would have been downplayed or omitted from educational materials in Quebec by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who controlled [[Quebec]]'s education system from 1627 until 1962.</ref><ref group=Note name=\"Richelieu\">However, Champlain was born in or near a time when the city was taken by Protestants, but Brouage became a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1642, was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a strong anti-Protestant.</ref> The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in [[Hiers-Brouage|Brouage]].<ref group=Note>His family lived in Brouage at the time of his birth; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain Britannica.com]</ref>\n[[File:ChamplianStoneDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 Stone from Samuel de Champlain's birthplace in [[Brouage]], [[France]] (1574)]]\nBorn into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make [[nautical chart]]s, and write practical reports. His education did not include [[Ancient Greek]] or [[Latin]], so he did not read or learn from any ancient literature. As each French fleet had to assure its own defense at sea, Champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time: he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] during the later stages of [[French Wars of Religion|France's religious wars]] in [[Brittany]] from 1594 or 1595 to 1598, beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses. During this time he claimed to go on a \"certain secret voyage\" for the king,<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 62</ref> and saw combat (including maybe the [[Siege of Fort Crozon]], at the end of 1594).<ref name=F65>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 65 Note: Fischer cites numerous other authorities in repeating this.</ref> By 1597 he was a \"capitaine d'une compagnie\" serving in a garrison near [[Quimper, Finist\u00e8re|Quimper]].<ref name=\"F65\" />\n\n==Early travels==\n[[File:SamuelDeChamplainStatueILMVT.JPG|thumb|Champlain and guide<ref>[[#Weber1967|Weber (1967)]]</ref> in [[Isle La Motte, Vermont]], at the site Champlain is said to have first set foot in [[Vermont]] (and encamped) in 1609.

After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cadiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the [[West Indies]], again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.<ref>[[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], p. 87</ref> This journey lasted two years, and gave Champlain the opportunity to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to [[Mexico City]].

One of them is at the [[John Carter Brown Library]] at [[Brown University]].</ref> who rewarded Champlain with an annual pension. This report was published for the first time in 1870, by Laverdi\u00e8re, as ''Brief Discours des Choses plus remarquables que Sammuel Champlain de Brouage a reconneues aux Indes Occidentalles au voiage qu'il en a faict en icettes en l'ann\u00e9e 1599 et en l'ann\u00e9e 1601, comme ensuite'' (and in English as ''Narrative of a Voyage to the West Indies and Mexico 1599\u20131602'').

This Champlain did, and when his uncle died in June 1601, Champlain inherited his substantial estate. It included an estate near [[La Rochelle]], commercial properties in Spain, and a 150-ton merchant ship.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 98\u201399</ref> This inheritance, combined with the king's annual pension, gave the young explorer a great deal of independence, as he was not dependent on the financial backing of merchants and other investors.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 100</ref> From 1601 to 1603 Champlain served as a geographer in the court of King Henry IV. As part of his duties he traveled to [[France|French]] ports and learned much about [[North America]] from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from [[Nantucket]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to capitalise on the rich fishing grounds there. He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of [[Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit|Pierre de Chauvin]] at [[Tadoussac]].<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 100\u2013117</ref> When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in [[North America]] in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to [[Aymar de Chaste]]. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king's assent.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nChamplain's first trip to [[North America]] was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by [[Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 Du Pont]]. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship's captain on Chauvin's expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship. He educated Champlain about navigation in [[North America]], including the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and in dealing with the natives there (and in [[Acadia]] after).<ref name=\"Davignon\"/> The ''Bonne-Renomm\u00e9e'' (the ''Good Fame'') arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that [[Jacques Cartier]] had seen and described about sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible. Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to [[France]] on 20 September, published an account as ''Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l'an 1603'' (\"Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in [[New France]] in the year 1603\").<ref group=Note>Champlain did not begin using the honorific ''de'' in his name until at least 1610, when he married, the year King Henry was murdered. A reprint of this book in 1612 was credited to \"sieur ''de'' Champlain, [http://www.civilization.ca/vmnf/expos/champlain/oeuv_eng.html civilization.ca]</ref> Included in his account were meetings with [[Begourat]], a chief of the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] friends.\n\nPromising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as [[Acadia]]. It was led by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement. After exploring possible sites in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Champlain selected [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] as the site of the expedition's first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.\n\nIn 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as [[Cape Cod]], searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident [[Nauset]]s dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He named the area Mallebar (\"bad bar\").<ref>[[#NPS|NPS]]</ref><ref name=\"map\">[[#VermontMap|Vermont Map]]</ref>\n\n==Founding of Quebec==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Plaque commemorative samuel de champlain honfleur.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Honfleur]] commemorating Champlain's departures]]\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[George Agnew Reid]], done for the third centennial (1908), showing the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on the site of [[Quebec City]].<ref group=Note name=\"ships\" />]]\n\nIn the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of [[Honfleur]]. The main ship, called the [[Don de Dieu (ship)|''Don-de-Dieu'']] (French for the ''Gift of God''), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the ''L\u00e9vrier'' (the ''Hunt Dog''), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]] on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the [[Saguenay River]] ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \"Big River\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.<ref group=Note name=\"ships\">Only at his last arrival (in 1633), Champlain did not leave the ships at Tadoussac but sailed them directly to Quebec City.[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref>{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nOn July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the point of Quebec and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the ''[[Habitation de Qu\u00e9bec|Habitation]]'', with a wooden [[stockade]] and a moat {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of what is now [[Quebec City]]. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nUpon foundation of Quebec, a conspiracy, started by a locksmith, had formed to kill Champlain, in order to deliver the fort to the Spaniards or the Basques. Champlain, learning of the plot from one of his trusted pilots, apprehended, questioned, and pardoned the conspirators.\n\nIn the 1620s, the ''Habitation'' at Quebec was mainly a store for the ''Compagnie des Marchands'' (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden ''Fort Saint Louis'' newly built up the hill (south from the present-day ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of [[Louis H\u00e9bert]] and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law).{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n==Marriage==\nOne route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old [[Helene Boull\u00e9|H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boull\u00e9]]. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boull\u00e9, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on 27 December 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 287\u2013288</ref>\n\nChamplain's marriage was initially quite troubled, as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne rallied against joining him in August 1613.

The couple had 1 child, and Champlain adopted three Montagnais girls named Faith, Hope, and Charity in the winter of 1627\u201328.\n\n==Relations and war with Native Americans==\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|left|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage. It depicts a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nDuring the summer of 1609, Champlain attempted to form better relations with the local [[First Nations|native tribes]]. He made alliances with the [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (derogatorily called ''Huron'' by the French) and with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and the Etchemin, who lived in the area of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. These tribes sought Champlain's help in their war against the [[Haudenosaunee|Iroquois]], who lived farther south. Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the ''Rivi\u00e8re des Iroquois'' (now known as the [[Richelieu River]]), and became the first European to map [[Lake Champlain]]. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.\n\nOn 29 July, somewhere in the area near [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York]] (historians are not sure which of these two places, but [[Fort Ticonderoga]] historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle that began the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain's position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his [[arquebus]] and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. This action set the tone for [[Beaver Wars|poor French-Iroquois relations]] for the rest of the century.<ref group=Note>In 1701, [[Great Peace of Montreal|The Great Peace Treaty]] was signed in Montreal, involving the French and every Indigenous nation coming or living on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River except maybe in wintertime.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Sorel]] occurred on 19 June 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the [[Kingdom of France]] and his allies, the [[Wyandot people|Wendat people]], [[Algonquin people]] and [[Innu people]] against the [[Mohawk people]] in [[New France]] at present-day [[Sorel-Tracy]], [[Quebec]].

He traveled the [[Ottawa River]], later giving the first description of this area.<ref group=Note>In 1953, a rock was found at a location now known as the [[Storyland (Ontario)|Champlain lookout]], which bore the inscription \"Champlain juin 2, 1613\".

In 1614, he formed the \"Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo\" and \"Compagnie de Champlain\", which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four [[Recollects]] in order to further religious life in the new colony. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] was eventually given ''[[Seigneurial system of New France|en seigneurie]]'' large and valuable tracts of land, estimated at nearly 30% of all the lands granted by the [[King of France|French Crown]] in [[New France]].<ref name=\"roydalton\">[[#Dalton|Dalton (1968)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1615, Champlain reunited with [[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]], his capable interpreter, following separate four-year explorations.

The party passed [[Lake Ontario]] at its eastern tip where they hid their canoes and continued their journey by land. They followed the [[Oneida River]] until they arrived at the main Onondaga fort on October 10. The exact location of this place is still a matter of debate.

During his stay, he set off with them in their great deer hunt, during which he became lost and was forced to wander for three days living off game and sleeping under trees until he met up with a band of First Nations people by chance. He spent the rest of the winter learning \"their country, their manners, customs, modes of life\". On 22 May 1616, he left the Wendat country and returned to Quebec before heading back to France on 2 July.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Improving administration in New France==\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|Map of [[New France]] (Champlain, 1612).

Ronjat.<ref>[[#Guizot|Guizot]], p. 190</ref>]]\n\nChamplain returned to New France in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration. Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.\n\nChamplain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.\n\nIn 1627 the Caen brothers' company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade. Champlain was one of the 100 investors, and its first fleet, loaded with colonists and supplies, set sail in April 1628.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 404\u2013410</ref>\n\nChamplain had overwintered in Quebec.

Champlain refused to deal with them, misleading them to believe that Quebec's defenses were better than they actually were (Champlain had only 50 pounds of gunpowder to defend the community). Successfully bluffed, they withdrew, but encountered and captured the French supply fleet, cutting off that year's supplies to the colony.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 412\u2013415</ref> By the spring of 1629 supplies were dangerously low and Champlain was forced to send people to [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] and into Indian communities to conserve rations.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 418\u2013420</ref> On July 19, the Kirke brothers arrived before Quebec after intercepting Champlain's plea for help, and Champlain was forced to surrender the colony.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 421</ref> Many colonists were taken first to England and then to France by the Kirkes, but Champlain remained in London to begin the process of regaining the colony. A [[Treaty of Susa|peace treaty had been signed]] in April 1629, three months before the surrender, and, under the terms of that treaty, Quebec and other prizes that were taken by the Kirkes after the treaty were to be returned.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 428</ref> It was not until the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)|1632 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], however, that Quebec was formally given back to France. (David Kirke was rewarded when Charles I knighted him and gave him a charter for [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].) Champlain reclaimed his role as commander of New France on behalf of Richelieu on 1 March 1633, having served in the intervening years as commander in New France \"in the absence of my Lord the [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal de Richelieu]]\" from 1629 to 1635.<ref name=\"Trudel\">[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref> In 1632 Champlain published ''Voyages de la Nouvelle France'', which was dedicated to Cardinal Richelieu, and ''Traitt\u00e9 de la marine et du devoir d'un bon marinier'', a treatise on leadership, seamanship, and navigation. (Champlain made more than twenty-five round-trip crossings of the Atlantic in his lifetime, without losing a single ship.)<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 447</ref>\n\n==Last return, and last years working in Quebec==\nChamplain returned to Quebec on 22 May 1633, after an absence of four years. Richelieu gave him a commission as [[Lieutenant General of New France]], along with other titles and responsibilities, but not that of [[Governor of New France|Governor]]. Despite this lack of formal status, many colonists, French merchants, and Indians treated him as if he had the title; writings survive in which he is referred to as \"our governor\".<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 445\u2013446</ref> On 18 August 1634, he sent a report to Richelieu stating that he had rebuilt on the ruins of Quebec, enlarged its fortifications, and established two more habitations. One was 15 leagues upstream, and the other was at [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]]. He also began [[French and Iroquois Wars|an offensive]] against the Iroquois, reporting that he wanted them either wiped out or \"brought to reason\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==Death and burial==\nChamplain had a severe [[stroke]] in October 1635, and died on 25 December, leaving no immediate heirs. [[Jesuit]] records state he died in the care of his friend and confessor [[Charles Lallemant]].{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nAlthough his will (drafted in 17 November 1635) gave much of his French property to his wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, he made significant bequests to the Catholic missions and to individuals in the colony of Quebec. However, Marie Camaret, a cousin on his mother's side, challenged the will in Paris and had it overturned. It is unclear exactly what happened to his estate.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], p. 520</ref><ref>[[#Heidenreich|Heidenreich]]</ref><ref>[[#Le Blant1964|Le Blant (1964)]], pp 425\u2013437</ref>\n\nSamuel de Champlain was temporarily buried in the church while a standalone chapel was built to hold his remains in the upper part of the city. Unfortunately, this small building, along with many others, was destroyed by a large fire in 1640. Though immediately rebuilt, no traces of it exist anymore: his exact burial site is still unknown, despite much research since about 1850, including several archaeological digs in the city. There is general agreement that the previous Champlain chapel site, and the remains of Champlain, should be somewhere near the [[Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral]].<ref>[[#Travels|Champlain: Travels in the Canadian Francophonie]]</ref><ref>[[#La Chapelle|La Chappelle]]</ref>\n\nThe search for Champlain's remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer [[Louise Penny]]'s 2010 novel, ''Bury Your Dead''.<ref>[[#Penny|Penny (2010)]]</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain (Qu\u00e9bec).jpg|thumb|Statue of Samuel de Champlain at sunrise (looking to the north-west; with a similar expressive face as traditionally [[Jacques Cartier]]'s), by {{interlanguage link|Paul-Romain Marie L\u00e9once Chevr\u00e9|fr|Paul Chevr\u00e9}} (Paris, 1896\u20131898), as newly repaired for 2008, at [[Quebec City]] since 1898, near ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' grand hotel, on the ''[[Terrasse Dufferin]]''.]]\n\nMany sites and landmarks have been named to honour Champlain, who was a prominent figure in many parts of [[Acadia]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]].

[[Lake Champlain]], which straddles the border between northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]], extending slightly across the border into [[Canada]], was named by him, in 1609, when he led an expedition along the [[Richelieu River]], exploring a long, narrow lake situated between the [[Green Mountains]] of present-day [[Vermont]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]].

The latter confirmed Champlain in his office [...]. On 7 May 1620, Louis XIII wrote to Champlain to enjoin him to maintain the country 'in obedience to me, making the people who are there live as closely in conformity with the laws of my kingdom as you can.' From that moment Champlain was to devote himself exclusively to the administration of the country; he was to undertake no further great voyages of discovery; his career as an explorer had ended.\"</ref> In every way but formal title, Samuel de Champlain served as [[Governor of New France]], a title that may have been formally unavailable to him owing to his non-noble status.<ref group=Note name=\"honorifics\">Some say that the King of France made him his \"''royal'' geographer\", but it is unproven and may only come from [[Marc Lescarbot]] books: Champlain never used that title. The honorific \"''de''\" was only added to his name from 1610, when he was already well-known, right after his patron, King [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], was murdered. This usage by a non-noble was tolerated so that he would continue to gain access to the court during the long regency of [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII]] (who was only eight years old at the death of his father). Champlain received the official title of \"lieutenant\" (adjunct representative) of whichever noble was designated as Viceroy of [[New France]], the first being [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons]]. From 1629 Champlain was named \"commandant\" under the authority of the King Minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]. It was Champlain's successor, [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny]], who was the first to be formally named as the governor of New France, when he moved to Quebec City in 1636 and became the first noble to live there in that century.</ref> He established trading companies that sent goods, primarily fur, to France, and oversaw the growth of New France in the [[St. Lawrence River]] valley until his death, in 1635.\n\nChamplain is memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", with many places, streets, and structures in northeastern North America bearing his name, most notably [[Lake Champlain]].\n\n==Birth year, location and family==\n[[File:Samuel-de-champlain-s.jpg|thumb|right|Inauthentic depiction of Champlain,<br />by [[Th\u00e9ophile Hamel]] (1870),<br />after the one by Ducornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1856),<br /> based on a portrait of [[Michel Particelli d'Emery]] ([[death|d.]] 1650)<br />by Balthasar Moncornet ([[death|d.]]&nbsp;1668).<br />\u2014 No authentic portrait of Champlain is known to exist.<ref>[[#Bishop1948|Bishop (1948)]], pp 6\u20137</ref>|alt=A half-length portrait of a man, set against a background that is a red curtain to the left and a landscape scene to the right.

He was born on or before 13 August 1574, according to a recent baptism record<!--if the record of a 1574 [[baptism]] is \"recent\", it is surely bogus; should this read \"recently found\"?--> found by Jean-Marie Germe, French genealogist.<ref name=\"birth\" /><ref group=Note name=\"birth2\" /><ref name=Germe>[[#Germe|Germe]], p. 2</ref> Although in 1870, the Canadian Catholic priest Laverdi\u00e8re, in the first chapter of his ''\u0152uvres de Champlain'', accepted Pierre-Damien Rainguet's<ref>[[#Rainguet1851|Rainguet (1851)]]</ref> estimate and tried to justify it, his calculations were based on assumptions now believed, or proven, to be incorrect. Although L\u00e9opold Delayant (member, secretary, then president of ''l'Acad\u00e9mie des belles-lettres, sciences et arts de La Rochelle'') wrote as early as 1867 that Rainguet's estimate was wrong, the books of Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re have had a significant influence. The 1567 date was carved on numerous [[monuments]] dedicated to Champlain and is widely regarded as accurate. In the first half of the 20th century, some authors disagreed, choosing 1570 or 1575 instead of 1567. In 1978 Jean Liebel published groundbreaking research about these estimates of Champlain's birth year and concluded, \"Samuel Champlain was born about 1580 in Brouage, France.\"<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], p. 236</ref> Liebel asserts that some authors, including the Catholic priests Rainguet and Laverdi\u00e8re, preferred years when Brouage was under Catholic control (which include 1567, 1570, and 1575).<ref>[[#Liebel1978|Liebel (1978)]], pp. 229\u2013237.</ref>\nChamplain claimed to be from Brouage in the title of his 1603 book and to be ''Saintongeois'' in the title of his second book (1613). He belonged to either a [[Protestant]] family, or a tolerant [[Roman Catholic]] one, since Brouage was most of the time a Catholic city in a Protestant region, and his [[Old Testament]] first name ([[Samuel]]) was not usually given to Catholic children.<ref group=Note name=\"Laberge\">According to many modern historians, including Alain Laberge, the 2008 Chair of the History Department at [[Quebec City]]'s [[Laval University]], a specialist in the history of New France, Champlain could have been born a [[Protestant]]. A guest on the 6 February 2008 [[CBC Radio|CBC]] radio programme, ''[[Sounds Like Canada]]'', Professor Laberge said that the fact of Champlain's Protestantism would have been downplayed or omitted from educational materials in Quebec by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], who controlled [[Quebec]]'s education system from 1627 until 1962.</ref><ref group=Note name=\"Richelieu\">However, Champlain was born in or near a time when the city was taken by Protestants, but Brouage became a royal fortress and its governor, from 1627 until his death in 1642, was [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a strong anti-Protestant.</ref> The exact location of his birth is thus also not known with certainty, but at the time of his birth his parents were living in [[Hiers-Brouage|Brouage]].<ref group=Note>His family lived in Brouage at the time of his birth; the exact place and date of his birth are unknown.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105187/Samuel-de-Champlain Britannica.com]</ref>\n[[File:ChamplianStoneDingleTowerHalifaxNovaScotia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sir Sandford Fleming Park]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] \u2013 Stone from Samuel de Champlain's birthplace in [[Brouage]], [[France]] (1574)]]\nBorn into a family of mariners (both his father and uncle-in-law were sailors, or navigators), Samuel Champlain learned to navigate, draw, make [[nautical chart]]s, and write practical reports.

As each French fleet had to assure its own defense at sea, Champlain sought to learn to fight with the firearms of his time: he acquired this practical knowledge when serving with the army of [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] during the later stages of [[French Wars of Religion|France's religious wars]] in [[Brittany]] from 1594 or 1595 to 1598, beginning as a quartermaster responsible for the feeding and care of horses.

After a difficult passage, he spent some time in Cadiz before his uncle, whose ship was then chartered to accompany a large Spanish fleet to the [[West Indies]], again offered him a place on the ship. His uncle, who gave command of the ship to Jeronimo de Valaebrera, instructed the young Champlain to watch over the ship.<ref>[[#Litalien|Litalien (2004)]], p. 87</ref> This journey lasted two years, and gave Champlain the opportunity to see or hear about Spanish holdings from the Caribbean to [[Mexico City]].

As part of his duties he traveled to [[France|French]] ports and learned much about [[North America]] from the fishermen that seasonally traveled to coastal areas from [[Nantucket]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to capitalise on the rich fishing grounds there. He also made a study of previous French failures at colonization in the area, including that of [[Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit|Pierre de Chauvin]] at [[Tadoussac]].<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 100\u2013117</ref> When Chauvin forfeited his monopoly on fur trade in [[North America]] in 1602, responsibility for renewing the trade was given to [[Aymar de Chaste]]. Champlain approached de Chaste about a position on the first voyage, which he received with the king's assent.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 121\u2013123</ref>\n\nChamplain's first trip to [[North America]] was as an observer on a fur-trading expedition led by [[Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 Du Pont]]. Du Pont was a navigator and merchant who had been a ship's captain on Chauvin's expedition, and with whom Champlain established a firm lifelong friendship. He educated Champlain about navigation in [[North America]], including the [[Saint Lawrence River]], and in dealing with the natives there (and in [[Acadia]] after).<ref name=\"Davignon\"/> The ''Bonne-Renomm\u00e9e'' (the ''Good Fame'') arrived at Tadoussac on March 15, 1603. Champlain was anxious to see for himself all of the places that [[Jacques Cartier]] had seen and described about sixty years earlier, and wanted to go even further than Cartier, if possible. Champlain created a map of the Saint Lawrence on this trip and, after his return to [[France]] on 20 September, published an account as ''Des Sauvages: ou voyage de Samuel Champlain, de Brouages, faite en la France nouvelle l'an 1603'' (\"Concerning the Savages: or travels of Samuel Champlain of Brouages, made in [[New France]] in the year 1603\").<ref group=Note>Champlain did not begin using the honorific ''de'' in his name until at least 1610, when he married, the year King Henry was murdered. A reprint of this book in 1612 was credited to \"sieur ''de'' Champlain, [http://www.civilization.ca/vmnf/expos/champlain/oeuv_eng.html civilization.ca]</ref> Included in his account were meetings with [[Begourat]], a chief of the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] at Tadoussac, in which positive relationships were established between the French and the many Montagnais gathered there, with some [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] friends.\n\nPromising to King Henry to report on further discoveries, Champlain joined a second expedition to New France in the spring of 1604. This trip, once again an exploratory journey without women and children, lasted several years, and focused on areas south of the St. Lawrence River, in what later became known as [[Acadia]]. It was led by [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Pierre Dugua de Mons]], a noble and Protestant merchant who had been given a fur trading monopoly in New France by the king. Dugua asked Champlain to find a site for winter settlement. After exploring possible sites in the [[Bay of Fundy]], Champlain selected [[Saint Croix Island, New Brunswick|Saint Croix Island]] in the [[Saint Croix River (Maine \u2013 New Brunswick)|St. Croix River]] as the site of the expedition's first winter settlement. After enduring a harsh winter on the island the settlement was relocated across the bay where they established [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]. Until 1607, Champlain used that site as his base, while he explored the Atlantic coast. Dugua was forced to leave the settlement for France in September 1605, because he learned that his monopoly was at risk. His monopoly was rescinded by the king in July 1607 under pressure from other merchants and proponents of free trade, leading to the abandonment of the settlement.\n\nIn 1605 and 1606, Champlain explored the North American coast as far south as [[Cape Cod]], searching for sites for a permanent settlement. Minor skirmishes with the resident [[Nauset]]s dissuaded him from the idea of establishing one near present-day [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He named the area Mallebar (\"bad bar\").<ref>[[#NPS|NPS]]</ref><ref name=\"map\">[[#VermontMap|Vermont Map]]</ref>\n\n==Founding of Quebec==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}\n[[File:Plaque commemorative samuel de champlain honfleur.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Honfleur]] commemorating Champlain's departures]]\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[George Agnew Reid]], done for the third centennial (1908), showing the arrival of Samuel de Champlain on the site of [[Quebec City]].<ref group=Note name=\"ships\" />]]\n\nIn the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of [[Honfleur]]. The main ship, called the [[Don de Dieu (ship)|''Don-de-Dieu'']] (French for the ''Gift of God''), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the ''L\u00e9vrier'' (the ''Hunt Dog''), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]] on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the [[Saguenay River]] ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \"Big River\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.<ref group=Note name=\"ships\">Only at his last arrival (in 1633), Champlain did not leave the ships at Tadoussac but sailed them directly to Quebec City.[[#Trudel|Trudel (1979)]]</ref>{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nOn July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the point of Quebec and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the ''[[Habitation de Qu\u00e9bec|Habitation]]'', with a wooden [[stockade]] and a moat {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of what is now [[Quebec City]]. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\nUpon foundation of Quebec, a conspiracy, started by a locksmith, had formed to kill Champlain, in order to deliver the fort to the Spaniards or the Basques. Champlain, learning of the plot from one of his trusted pilots, apprehended, questioned, and pardoned the conspirators.\n\nIn the 1620s, the ''Habitation'' at Quebec was mainly a store for the ''Compagnie des Marchands'' (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden ''Fort Saint Louis'' newly built up the hill (south from the present-day ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of [[Louis H\u00e9bert]] and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law).{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}\n\n==Marriage==\nOne route Champlain may have chosen to improve his access to the court of the regent was his decision to enter into marriage with the twelve-year-old [[Helene Boull\u00e9|H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boull\u00e9]]. She was the daughter of Nicolas Boull\u00e9, a man charged with carrying out royal decisions at court. The marriage contract was signed on 27 December 1610 in presence of Dugua, who had dealt with the father, and the couple was married three days later. The terms of the contract called for the marriage to be consummated two years later.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 287\u2013288</ref>\n\nChamplain's marriage was initially quite troubled, as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne rallied against joining him in August 1613.

The couple had 1 child, and Champlain adopted three Montagnais girls named Faith, Hope, and Charity in the winter of 1627\u201328.\n\n==Relations and war with Native Americans==\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|left|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage. It depicts a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nDuring the summer of 1609, Champlain attempted to form better relations with the local [[First Nations|native tribes]]. He made alliances with the [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (derogatorily called ''Huron'' by the French) and with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]], the [[Innu people|Montagnais]] and the Etchemin, who lived in the area of the [[St. Lawrence River]]. These tribes sought Champlain's help in their war against the [[Haudenosaunee|Iroquois]], who lived farther south. Champlain set off with nine French soldiers and 300 natives to explore the ''Rivi\u00e8re des Iroquois'' (now known as the [[Richelieu River]]), and became the first European to map [[Lake Champlain]]. Having had no encounters with the Haudenosaunee at this point many of the men headed back, leaving Champlain with only 2 Frenchmen and 60 natives.\n\nOn 29 July, somewhere in the area near [[Ticonderoga, New York|Ticonderoga]] and [[Crown Point, New York]] (historians are not sure which of these two places, but [[Fort Ticonderoga]] historians claim that it occurred near its site), Champlain and his party encountered a group of Haudenosaunee. In a battle that began the next day, two hundred and fifty Haudenosaunee advanced on Champlain's position, and one of his guides pointed out the three chiefs. In his account of the battle, Champlain recounts firing his [[arquebus]] and killing two of them with a single shot, after which one of his men killed the third. The Haudenosaunee turned and fled. This action set the tone for [[Beaver Wars|poor French-Iroquois relations]] for the rest of the century.<ref group=Note>In 1701, [[Great Peace of Montreal|The Great Peace Treaty]] was signed in Montreal, involving the French and every Indigenous nation coming or living on the shores of the Saint Lawrence River except maybe in wintertime.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Sorel]] occurred on 19 June 1610, with Samuel de Champlain supported by the [[Kingdom of France]] and his allies, the [[Wyandot people|Wendat people]], [[Algonquin people]] and [[Innu people]] against the [[Mohawk people]] in [[New France]] at present-day [[Sorel-Tracy]], [[Quebec]].

In 1614, he formed the \"Compagnie des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo\" and \"Compagnie de Champlain\", which bound the Rouen and Saint-Malo merchants for eleven years. He returned to New France in the spring of 1615 with four [[Recollects]] in order to further religious life in the new colony.

Ronjat.<ref>[[#Guizot|Guizot]], p. 190</ref>]]\n\nChamplain returned to New France in 1620 and was to spend the rest of his life focusing on administration of the territory rather than exploration. Champlain spent the winter building Fort Saint-Louis on top of Cape Diamond. By mid-May, he learned that the fur trading monopoly had been handed over to another company led by the Caen brothers. After some tense negotiations, it was decided to merge the two companies under the direction of the Caens. Champlain continued to work on relations with the natives and managed to impose on them a chief of his choice. He also negotiated a peace treaty with the Iroquois.\n\nChamplain continued to work on the fortifications of what became Quebec City, laying the first stone on 6 May 1624. On 15 August he once again returned to France where he was encouraged to continue his work as well as to continue looking for a passage to China, something widely believed to exist at the time. By July 5 he was back at Quebec and continued expanding the city.\n\nIn 1627 the Caen brothers' company lost its monopoly on the fur trade, and [[Cardinal Richelieu]] (who had joined the Royal Council in 1624 and rose rapidly to a position of dominance in French politics that he would hold until his death in 1642) formed the [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] (the Hundred Associates) to manage the fur trade. Champlain was one of the 100 investors, and its first fleet, loaded with colonists and supplies, set sail in April 1628.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer (2008)]], pp. 404\u2013410</ref>\n\nChamplain had overwintered in Quebec.

There is general agreement that the previous Champlain chapel site, and the remains of Champlain, should be somewhere near the [[Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral]].<ref>[[#Travels|Champlain: Travels in the Canadian Francophonie]]</ref><ref>[[#La Chapelle|La Chappelle]]</ref>\n\nThe search for Champlain's remains supplies a key plot-line in the crime writer [[Louise Penny]]'s 2010 novel, ''Bury Your Dead''.<ref>[[#Penny|Penny (2010)]]</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Samuel de Champlain (Qu\u00e9bec).jpg|thumb|Statue of Samuel de Champlain at sunrise (looking to the north-west; with a similar expressive face as traditionally [[Jacques Cartier]]'s), by {{interlanguage link|Paul-Romain Marie L\u00e9once Chevr\u00e9|fr|Paul Chevr\u00e9}} (Paris, 1896\u20131898), as newly repaired for 2008, at [[Quebec City]] since 1898, near ''[[Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac]]'' grand hotel, on the ''[[Terrasse Dufferin]]''.]]\n\nMany sites and landmarks have been named to honour Champlain, who was a prominent figure in many parts of [[Acadia]], [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Vermont]]. Memorialized as the \"Father of New France\" and \"Father of [[Acadia]]\", his historic significance endures in modern times. [[Lake Champlain]], which straddles the border between northern [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Vermont]], extending slightly across the border into [[Canada]], was named by him, in 1609, when he led an expedition along the [[Richelieu River]], exploring a long, narrow lake situated between the [[Green Mountains]] of present-day [[Vermont]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] of present-day [[New York (state)|New York]]. The first European to map and describe it, Champlain claimed the lake as his namesake.\n\nMemorials include:\n<!--geographic formations-->\n* [[Lake Champlain]], [[Champlain Valley]], the [[Champlain Trail Lakes]].\n* [[Champlain Sea]]: a past inlet of the Atlantic Ocean in North America, over the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]], the [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], and the [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]] rivers, to over [[Lake Champlain]], which inlet disappeared many thousands years before Champlain was born.\n* Champlain Mountain, [[Acadia National Park]] \u2013 which he first observed in 1604.<ref>[[#Acadia|Acadia National Park]]</ref>\n* A [[Champlain (town), New York|town]] and [[Champlain (village), New York|village]] in New York, as well as a [[Champlain, Ontario|township in Ontario]] and a [[Champlain, Quebec|municipality in Quebec]].\n* The provincial electoral district of [[Champlain (provincial electoral district)|Champlain]], [[Quebec]], and several defunct electoral districts elsewhere in Canada.\n* [[Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park]], a [[provincial park]] in northern Ontario near the town of [[Mattawa, Ontario|Mattawa]].\n<!--functional structures-->\n* [[Champlain Bridge (Montreal)|Champlain Bridge]], which connects the [[island of Montreal]] to [[Brossard]], Quebec across the St. Lawrence.\n* [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)|Champlain Bridge]], which connects the cities of [[Ottawa]], Ontario and [[Gatineau]], Quebec.\n* Champlain College, one of six colleges at [[Trent University]] in [[Peterborough, Ontario]], is named in his honour.\n* Fort Champlain, a [[dormitory]] at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]; named in his honour in 1965, it houses the 10th cadet squadron.\n* A French school in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]; [[\u00c9cole Champlain]], an elementary school in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]]; [[Champlain College]], in [[Burlington, Vermont]]; and [[Champlain Regional College]], a [[CEGEP]] with three campuses in Quebec.\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau Champlain|Marriott Ch\u00e2teau Champlain]] hotel, in Montreal.\n<!--streets and other commemorative items-->\n* Streets named Champlain in numerous cities, including Quebec, [[Shawinigan]], the city of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]] in the province of New Brunswick, in [[Plattsburgh]], and no less than eleven communities in northwestern Vermont.\n* A garden called Jardin Samuel-de-Champlain in Paris, France.\n* A memorial statue on Cumberland Avenue in [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]] on the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] in a park named for Champlain.\n* A memorial statue in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], Canada in [[Queen Square (Saint John, New Brunswick)|Queen Square]] that commemorates his discovery of the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]].<ref>[http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/Heritage/HistoricalTour/AdditionalInformation.htm Saint John Additional Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110701/http://www.saintjohn.nbcc.nb.ca/Heritage/HistoricalTour/AdditionalInformation.htm |date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n* A memorial statue in [[Isle La Motte, Vermont]], on the shore of [[Lake Champlain]].\n* The [[lighthouse]] at [[Crown Point, New York]] features a statue of Champlain by [[Carl Augustus Heber]].\n* A [[commemorative stamp]] issue in May 2006 jointly by the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[Canada Post]].<ref>[[#Gicker2006|Gicker (2006)]]</ref>\n* A statue in [[Ticonderoga, New York]], unveiled in 2009 to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Champlain's exploration of Lake Champlain.\n* A statue in [[Orillia]], Ontario at [[Couchiching Beach Park]] on [[Lake Couchiching]].

Various points are offered as the beginning for the latter era, though it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]] by [[Psamtik I]] in 664 BC, following the expulsion of the [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] rulers of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] by the [[Assyria]]ns under King [[Assurbanipal]]. The [[Periodization of Ancient Egypt|concept of a \"Third Intermediate Period\"]] was coined in 1978 by British Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Schneider|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Schneider (Egyptologist)|editor=Klaus-Peter Adam|title=Historiographie in der Antike|pp=181\u2013197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTMAu2LRbVUC&pg=PA182|date=27 August 2008|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-020672-2|chapter=Periodizing Egyptian History: Manetho, Convention, and Beyond}}</ref> \n\nThe period was one of decline and political instability, coinciding with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of civilizations in the [[Near East]] and [[Eastern Mediterranean]] (including the [[Greek Dark Ages]]). It was marked by division of the state for much of the period and conquest and rule by foreigners.\n\n[[File:NubianPharoahs.jpg|thumb|right|25th Dynasty]]\n[[File:Nuri main pyr.northeast.jpg|thumb|right|Nuri pyramids]]\n\n==History==\n\n=== Twenty-first Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe period of the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] is characterized by the country's fracturing kingship. Already during [[Ramesses XI]]'s reign, the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt]] was losing its grip on the city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], whose priests were becoming increasingly powerful. After his death, his successor, [[Smendes I]], ruled from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], but was mostly active only in Lower Egypt, which he controlled. Meanwhile, the [[High Priests of Amun at Thebes]] ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name.<ref>Kenneth A. Kitchen, ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC)'', 3rd edition, 1986, Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, p.531</ref> However, this division was less significant than it seems, since both the priests and pharaohs came from the same family.\n\n=== Twenty-second and Twenty-third Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe country was firmly reunited by the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] founded by [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC (or 943&nbsp;BC), who descended from [[Meshwesh]] immigrants, originally from [[Ancient Libya]]. This brought stability to the country for well over a century, but after the reign of [[Osorkon II]], particularly, the country had effectively split into two states, with [[Shoshenq III]] of the Twenty-second Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while [[Takelot II]] and his son Osorkon (the future [[Osorkon III]]) ruled Middle and Upper Egypt. In Thebes, a civil war engulfed the city, pitting the forces of [[Pedubast I]], who had proclaimed himself pharaoh, against the existing line of [[Takelot II]]/Osorkon B. The two factions squabbled continuously and the conflict was only resolved in Year 39 of Shoshenq III when Osorkon B comprehensively defeated his enemies. He proceeded to found the Upper Egyptian Libyan [[Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-third Dynasty]] of [[Osorkon III]] &ndash; [[Takelot III]] &ndash; [[Rudamun]], but this kingdom quickly fragmented after Rudamun's death, with the rise of local city states under kings such as [[Peftjaubast]] of [[Herakleopolis]], [[Nimlot of Hermopolis]], and [[Ini (pharaoh)|Ini]] at Thebes.\n\n=== Twenty-fourth Dynasty ===\n{{main|Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Nubian people|Nubian]] kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and the ensuing political instability. Prior to [[Piye]]'s Year 20 campaign into Egypt, the previous Nubian ruler &ndash; [[Kashta]] &ndash; had already extended his kingdom's influence into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet, the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot III's sister, to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis, to be her successor. Then, 20 years later, around 732 BC his successor, [[Piye]], marched north and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers: Peftjaubast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, [[Iuput II]] of Leontopolis and [[Tefnakht]] of Sais.\n\n=== Twenty-fifth Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nPiye established the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] and appointed the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother, [[Shabaka]], and then by his two sons [[Shebitku]] and [[Taharqa]]. The reunited Nile valley empire of the 25th Dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Pharaohs of the dynasty, among them Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonnet|first=Charles|title=The Nubian Pharaohs|year=2006|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-977-416-010-3|pages=142\u2013154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=1-55652-072-7|pages=219\u2013221}}</ref> The 25th&nbsp;Dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to their spiritual homeland at [[Napata]].  It was there (at El-Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th Dynasty pharaohs were buried under the first [[Nubian pyramids|pyramids]] to be constructed in the Nile valley in hundreds of years.<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 10\">{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia:  Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=0-520-06697-9|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David|title=Ancient Egypt|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-521270-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientegypt00davi_0/page/36 36\u201337]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientegypt00davi_0/page/36}}</ref>  The Napatan dynasty led to the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which flourished in [[Napata]] and [[Meroe]] until at least the 2nd century AD.<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 10\"/>\n\nThe international prestige of Egypt had declined considerably by this time. The country's international allies had fallen firmly into the sphere of influence of [[Assyria]] and from about 700 BC the question became when, not if, there would be war between the two states as Esarhaddon had realised that a conquest of Lower Egypt was necessary to protect Assyrians interests in the Levant.\n\nDespite Egypt's size and wealth, Assyria had a greater supply of timber, while Egypt had a chronic shortage, allowing Assyria to produce more charcoal needed for iron-smelting and thus giving Assyria a greater supply of iron weaponry. This disparity became critical during the Assyrian invasions of Egypt over the period 670-663 BC.<ref name=KS05>{{cite book |last=Shillington |first=Kevin |title=History of Africa |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |isbn=0-333-59957-8 |page=40}}</ref>  Consequently, pharaoh [[Taharqa]]'s reign, and that of his successor [[Tantamani]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians. In 664 BC the Assyrians delivered a mortal blow, [[Sack of Thebes|sacking Thebes]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Following these events, and starting with [[Atlanersa]], no Kushite ruler would ever rule over Egypt again.\n\n=== End of the Third Intermediate Period ===\n\nUpper Egypt remained for a time under the rule of Taharqa and Tantamani, whilst Lower Egypt was ruled from 664&nbsp;BC by the nascent [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]], client kings established by the Assyrians. In 663 BC, Tantamani launched a full-scale invasion of Lower Egypt, taking Memphis in April of this year, killing [[Necho I]] of Sais in the process as Necho had remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Tantamani barely had the time to receive the submission of some Delta kinglets and expel the remaining Assyrians that a large army led by Ashurbanipal and Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] came back. Tantamani was defeated north of Memphis and [[Sack of Thebes|Thebes was thoroughly sacked]] shortly after. The Kushite king withdrew to Nubia while the Assyrian influence in Upper Egypt quickly waned. Permanently weakened by the sack, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Psamtik's fleet in 656 BC. To affirm his authority, Psamtik  placed his daughter in position to be the future [[Divine Adoratrice of Amun]], thereby also submitting the priesthood of Amun and effectively uniting Egypt. Tantamani's successor [[Atlanersa]] was in no position to attempt a reconquest of Egypt as Psamtik also secured the southern border at [[Elephantine]] and may even have sent a military campaign to [[Napata]]. Concurrently, Psamtik managed to free himself from the Assyrian vassalage while remaining on good terms with Ashurbanipal, possibly owing to an ongoing rebellion in Babylon. By doing so, hebrought  increased stability to the country during his 54-year reign from the city of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]].\n\nFour successive Saite kings continued guiding Egypt into another period of peace and prosperity from 610 to 525 BC. Unfortunately for this dynasty, a new power was growing in the Near East &ndash; the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]]. Pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] had succeeded his father [[Ahmose II]] for only 6 months before he had to face the [[Persian Empire]] at [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|Pelusium]]. The Persians had already taken [[Babylon]] and Egypt was no match for them. Psamtik III was defeated and briefly escaped to Memphis, before he was ultimately imprisoned and, later, executed at [[Susa]], the capital of the Persian king [[Cambyses]], who now assumed the formal title of Pharaoh.\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe historiography of this period is disputed for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is a dispute about the utility of a very artificial term that covers an extremely long and complicated period of Egyptian history. The Third Intermediate Period includes long periods of stability as well as chronic instability and civil conflict: its very name rather clouds this fact. Secondly, there are significant problems of chronology stemming from several areas: first, there are the difficulties in dating that are common to all of [[Egyptian chronology]] but these are compounded due to synchronisms with Biblical archaeology that also contain heavily disputed dates. [[Peter James (historian)|James et al.]] argued contra Kitchen that the period lasted less than 200 years - starting later than 850 BC but ending at the conventional date - as the five dynasties had many years of overlap.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1991|title=Centuries of Darkness: Context, Methodology and Implications [Review Feature]|url=https://www.centuries.co.uk/CoDreviewfeature1991.pdf|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=228ff|doi=10.1017/S0959774300000378|issn=1474-0540|archive-url=|via=}}</ref> Finally, some [[Egyptologist]]s and biblical scholars, such as [[Kenneth Kitchen]] and [[David Rohl]] have novel or controversial theories about the family relationships of the dynasties comprising the period.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Late Bronze Age collapse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Dodson, Aidan Mark. 2001. \u201cThird Intermediate Period.\u201d In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', edited by Donald Bruce Redford.

Various points are offered as the beginning for the latter era, though it is most often regarded as dating from the foundation of the [[Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-Sixth Dynasty]] by [[Psamtik I]] in 664 BC, following the expulsion of the [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush|Kushite]] rulers of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] by the [[Assyria]]ns under King [[Assurbanipal]]. The [[Periodization of Ancient Egypt|concept of a \"Third Intermediate Period\"]] was coined in 1978 by British Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]].<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Schneider|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Schneider (Egyptologist)|editor=Klaus-Peter Adam|title=Historiographie in der Antike|pp=181\u2013197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTMAu2LRbVUC&pg=PA182|date=27 August 2008|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-020672-2|chapter=Periodizing Egyptian History: Manetho, Convention, and Beyond}}</ref> \n\nThe period was one of decline and political instability, coinciding with the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of civilizations in the [[Near East]] and [[Eastern Mediterranean]] (including the [[Greek Dark Ages]]). It was marked by division of the state for much of the period and conquest and rule by foreigners.\n\n[[File:NubianPharoahs.jpg|thumb|right|25th Dynasty]]\n[[File:Nuri main pyr.northeast.jpg|thumb|right|Nuri pyramids]]\n\n==History==\n\n=== Twenty-first Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe period of the [[Twenty-first Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-first Dynasty]] is characterized by the country's fracturing kingship. Already during [[Ramesses XI]]'s reign, the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt]] was losing its grip on the city of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], whose priests were becoming increasingly powerful. After his death, his successor, [[Smendes I]], ruled from the city of [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]], but was mostly active only in Lower Egypt, which he controlled. Meanwhile, the [[High Priests of Amun at Thebes]] ruled Middle and Upper Egypt in all but name.<ref>Kenneth A. Kitchen, ''The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC)'', 3rd edition, 1986, Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, p.531</ref> However, this division was less significant than it seems, since both the priests and pharaohs came from the same family.\n\n=== Twenty-second and Twenty-third Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nThe country was firmly reunited by the [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] founded by [[Shoshenq I]] in 945 BC (or 943&nbsp;BC), who descended from [[Meshwesh]] immigrants, originally from [[Ancient Libya]]. This brought stability to the country for well over a century, but after the reign of [[Osorkon II]], particularly, the country had effectively split into two states, with [[Shoshenq III]] of the Twenty-second Dynasty controlling Lower Egypt by 818 BC while [[Takelot II]] and his son Osorkon (the future [[Osorkon III]]) ruled Middle and Upper Egypt. In Thebes, a civil war engulfed the city, pitting the forces of [[Pedubast I]], who had proclaimed himself pharaoh, against the existing line of [[Takelot II]]/Osorkon B. The two factions squabbled continuously and the conflict was only resolved in Year 39 of Shoshenq III when Osorkon B comprehensively defeated his enemies. He proceeded to found the Upper Egyptian Libyan [[Twenty-third Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-third Dynasty]] of [[Osorkon III]] &ndash; [[Takelot III]] &ndash; [[Rudamun]], but this kingdom quickly fragmented after Rudamun's death, with the rise of local city states under kings such as [[Peftjaubast]] of [[Herakleopolis]], [[Nimlot of Hermopolis]], and [[Ini (pharaoh)|Ini]] at Thebes.\n\n=== Twenty-fourth Dynasty ===\n{{main|Twenty-fourth dynasty of Egypt}}\nThe [[Nubian people|Nubian]] kingdom to the south took full advantage of this division and the ensuing political instability. Prior to [[Piye]]'s Year 20 campaign into Egypt, the previous Nubian ruler &ndash; [[Kashta]] &ndash; had already extended his kingdom's influence into Thebes when he compelled Shepenupet, the serving Divine Adoratice of Amun and Takelot III's sister, to adopt his own daughter Amenirdis, to be her successor. Then, 20 years later, around 732 BC his successor, [[Piye]], marched north and defeated the combined might of several native Egyptian rulers: Peftjaubast, Osorkon IV of Tanis, [[Iuput II]] of Leontopolis and [[Tefnakht]] of Sais.\n\n=== Twenty-fifth Dynasty ===\n{{Main|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n\nPiye established the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-fifth Dynasty]] and appointed the defeated rulers as his provincial governors. He was succeeded first by his brother, [[Shabaka]], and then by his two sons [[Shebitku]] and [[Taharqa]]. The reunited Nile valley empire of the 25th Dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. Pharaohs of the dynasty, among them Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bonnet|first=Charles|title=The Nubian Pharaohs|year=2006|publisher=The American University in Cairo Press|location=New York|isbn=978-977-416-010-3|pages=142\u2013154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Diop|first=Cheikh Anta|title=The African Origin of Civilization|year=1974|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=1-55652-072-7|pages=219\u2013221}}</ref> The 25th&nbsp;Dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to their spiritual homeland at [[Napata]].  It was there (at El-Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th Dynasty pharaohs were buried under the first [[Nubian pyramids|pyramids]] to be constructed in the Nile valley in hundreds of years.<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 10\">{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia:  Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=G.|title=General History of Africa|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|location=California, USA|isbn=0-520-06697-9|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Emberling|first=Geoff|title=Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa|year=2011|publisher=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|location=New York|isbn=978-0-615-48102-9|pages=9\u201311}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Silverman|first=David|title=Ancient Egypt|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-521270-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancientegypt00davi_0/page/36 36\u201337]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientegypt00davi_0/page/36}}</ref>  The Napatan dynasty led to the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which flourished in [[Napata]] and [[Meroe]] until at least the 2nd century AD.<ref name=\"Emberling 2011 10\"/>\n\nThe international prestige of Egypt had declined considerably by this time. The country's international allies had fallen firmly into the sphere of influence of [[Assyria]] and from about 700 BC the question became when, not if, there would be war between the two states as Esarhaddon had realised that a conquest of Lower Egypt was necessary to protect Assyrians interests in the Levant.\n\nDespite Egypt's size and wealth, Assyria had a greater supply of timber, while Egypt had a chronic shortage, allowing Assyria to produce more charcoal needed for iron-smelting and thus giving Assyria a greater supply of iron weaponry. This disparity became critical during the Assyrian invasions of Egypt over the period 670-663 BC.<ref name=KS05>{{cite book |last=Shillington |first=Kevin |title=History of Africa |year=2005 |publisher=Macmillan Education |location=Oxford |isbn=0-333-59957-8 |page=40}}</ref>  Consequently, pharaoh [[Taharqa]]'s reign, and that of his successor [[Tantamani]], were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians. In 664 BC the Assyrians delivered a mortal blow, [[Sack of Thebes|sacking Thebes]] and [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Following these events, and starting with [[Atlanersa]], no Kushite ruler would ever rule over Egypt again.\n\n=== End of the Third Intermediate Period ===\n\nUpper Egypt remained for a time under the rule of Taharqa and Tantamani, whilst Lower Egypt was ruled from 664&nbsp;BC by the nascent [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|26th Dynasty]], client kings established by the Assyrians. In 663 BC, Tantamani launched a full-scale invasion of Lower Egypt, taking Memphis in April of this year, killing [[Necho I]] of Sais in the process as Necho had remained loyal to Ashurbanipal. Tantamani barely had the time to receive the submission of some Delta kinglets and expel the remaining Assyrians that a large army led by Ashurbanipal and Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] came back. Tantamani was defeated north of Memphis and [[Sack of Thebes|Thebes was thoroughly sacked]] shortly after. The Kushite king withdrew to Nubia while the Assyrian influence in Upper Egypt quickly waned. Permanently weakened by the sack, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Psamtik's fleet in 656 BC. To affirm his authority, Psamtik  placed his daughter in position to be the future [[Divine Adoratrice of Amun]], thereby also submitting the priesthood of Amun and effectively uniting Egypt. Tantamani's successor [[Atlanersa]] was in no position to attempt a reconquest of Egypt as Psamtik also secured the southern border at [[Elephantine]] and may even have sent a military campaign to [[Napata]]. Concurrently, Psamtik managed to free himself from the Assyrian vassalage while remaining on good terms with Ashurbanipal, possibly owing to an ongoing rebellion in Babylon. By doing so, hebrought  increased stability to the country during his 54-year reign from the city of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]].\n\nFour successive Saite kings continued guiding Egypt into another period of peace and prosperity from 610 to 525 BC. Unfortunately for this dynasty, a new power was growing in the Near East &ndash; the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]]. Pharaoh [[Psamtik III]] had succeeded his father [[Ahmose II]] for only 6 months before he had to face the [[Persian Empire]] at [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)|Pelusium]]. The Persians had already taken [[Babylon]] and Egypt was no match for them. Psamtik III was defeated and briefly escaped to Memphis, before he was ultimately imprisoned and, later, executed at [[Susa]], the capital of the Persian king [[Cambyses]], who now assumed the formal title of Pharaoh.\n\n== Historiography ==\nThe historiography of this period is disputed for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there is a dispute about the utility of a very artificial term that covers an extremely long and complicated period of Egyptian history. The Third Intermediate Period includes long periods of stability as well as chronic instability and civil conflict: its very name rather clouds this fact. Secondly, there are significant problems of chronology stemming from several areas: first, there are the difficulties in dating that are common to all of [[Egyptian chronology]] but these are compounded due to synchronisms with Biblical archaeology that also contain heavily disputed dates. [[Peter James (historian)|James et al.]] argued contra Kitchen that the period lasted less than 200 years - starting later than 850 BC but ending at the conventional date - as the five dynasties had many years of overlap.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1991|title=Centuries of Darkness: Context, Methodology and Implications [Review Feature]|url=https://www.centuries.co.uk/CoDreviewfeature1991.pdf|journal=Cambridge Archaeological Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=228ff|doi=10.1017/S0959774300000378|issn=1474-0540|archive-url=|via=}}</ref> Finally, some [[Egyptologist]]s and biblical scholars, such as [[Kenneth Kitchen]] and [[David Rohl]] have novel or controversial theories about the family relationships of the dynasties comprising the period.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Late Bronze Age collapse]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Dodson, Aidan Mark. 2001. \u201cThird Intermediate Period.\u201d In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', edited by Donald Bruce Redford.
