After a promising start to their opening drive, Clemson was forced to punt on 4th-and-23, giving LSU the ball on their own 7-yard-line. LSU's opening drive was far less productive, as they punted after three plays totaling a net loss of four yards. Clemson opened their ensuing drive on the LSU 45. A [[three-and-out]] followed, but the Clemson punt coverage team again came up big, downing the ball at the 4-yard-line. While the next LSU drive resulted in positive yards, a punt was the end result, and Clemson took over at their own 33 and scored in five plays, opening the scoring with a [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] rushing touchdown 8:26 into the game. LSU opened their next drive with a touchback, and recorded a first down for the first time, but again punted, giving Clemson the ball at their own 25; Clemson punted right back, and LSU took over at their own 29. On this drive, the LSU offense moved the ball seventy yards in just 4 plays, capped by a long [[Joe Burrow]] pass to wide receiver [[Ja'Marr Chase]], tying the game at seven with 2:20 remaining in the opening quarter.

Potter, giving them a 10\u20137 edge. Following LSU's fourth punt of the evening, Clemson started with their worst field position yet, as they got the ball at their own 4. This did not deter the Clemson offense, as they covered the ninety-six yards ahead of them in only four plays, capping the touchdown drive with a long run by [[Tee Higgins]]; this extended Clemson's lead to ten. LSU responded with a quick drive of their own, scoring in five plays to narrow the lead to three. Clemson's next drive ended in a punt, and LSU capitalized with another long touchdown drive to take their first lead of the contest, by four, with just over five minutes until halftime. Clemson was unable to respond on offense; they punted and LSU got the ball on their own 5-yard-line. Joe Burrow and the LSU offense continued to build their momentum with their third consecutive touchdown drive of 75-plus yards to increase the lead to 11, 28\u201317, heading into halftime.<ref name=liveupdates/><ref name=PlayByPlay/>\n\n[[File:2020-0113-ClydeEdwards-Helaire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|LSU running back [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]] gives a post-game interview.]]\nLSU opened the second half by receiving the kickoff; their ensuing drive resulted in a three-and-out, and Clemson took over on the 50-yard-line. For the first time in nearly an entire quarter, the Clemson offense found the end zone, as [[Travis Etienne]] capped a 6 play drive with his first touchdown of the day. Trevor Lawrence completed a pass to Amari Rodgers for the two-point conversion, cutting the LSU lead to three points. Joe Burrow's offense was again unable to produce on offense, and the second half (as did the first half) began with two three-and-outs for LSU. Clemson's next drive finished similarly, as a punt followed four plays totaling 14 yards. LSU took over on their own 32. On the fifth play of LSU's ensuing drive, Clemson starting MLB James Skalski was ejected from the game for a [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|targeting penalty]]; LSU scored on the next play on a touchdown pass from Burrow to Thaddeus Moss (one that gave Burrow sole possession of the FBS record for touchdown passes in a season with 59)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chippin |first1=Alex |title=Burrow breaks FBS single-season TD pass record |url=https://www.thescore.com/ncaaf/news/1926980 |website=theScore.com |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> to increase their lead to ten.

They drove to the Clemson 27 before attempting a 45-yard field goal, which Cade York missed wide right. Lawrence and the Clemson offense were unable to capitalize on the mistake, however; they went three-and-out and punted to the LSU 43.

For the fourth drive in a row, Clemson punted; the ball was downed at the LSU 10. After taking 5:24 off the clock, LSU punted the ball back, and Clemson took over with just under five minutes left, on their own 15. However, three plays later, Trevor Lawrence fumbled at the end of his rush; it was recovered by LSU's [[Derek Stingley Jr.]] with 3:53 to go.

LSU opened their next drive with a touchback, and recorded a first down for the first time, but again punted, giving Clemson the ball at their own 25; Clemson punted right back, and LSU took over at their own 29. On this drive, the LSU offense moved the ball seventy yards in just 4 plays, capped by a long [[Joe Burrow]] pass to wide receiver [[Ja'Marr Chase]], tying the game at seven with 2:20 remaining in the opening quarter.

Potter, giving them a 10\u20137 edge. Following LSU's fourth punt of the evening, Clemson started with their worst field position yet, as they got the ball at their own 4. This did not deter the Clemson offense, as they covered the ninety-six yards ahead of them in only four plays, capping the touchdown drive with a long run by [[Tee Higgins]]; this extended Clemson's lead to ten. LSU responded with a quick drive of their own, scoring in five plays to narrow the lead to three. Clemson's next drive ended in a punt, and LSU capitalized with another long touchdown drive to take their first lead of the contest, by four, with just over five minutes until halftime. Clemson was unable to respond on offense; they punted and LSU got the ball on their own 5-yard-line.

For the first time in nearly an entire quarter, the Clemson offense found the end zone, as [[Travis Etienne]] capped a 6 play drive with his first touchdown of the day. Trevor Lawrence completed a pass to Amari Rodgers for the two-point conversion, cutting the LSU lead to three points. Joe Burrow's offense was again unable to produce on offense, and the second half (as did the first half) began with two three-and-outs for LSU. Clemson's next drive finished similarly, as a punt followed four plays totaling 14 yards. LSU took over on their own 32. On the fifth play of LSU's ensuing drive, Clemson starting MLB James Skalski was ejected from the game for a [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|targeting penalty]]; LSU scored on the next play on a touchdown pass from Burrow to Thaddeus Moss (one that gave Burrow sole possession of the FBS record for touchdown passes in a season with 59)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chippin |first1=Alex |title=Burrow breaks FBS single-season TD pass record |url=https://www.thescore.com/ncaaf/news/1926980 |website=theScore.com |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> to increase their lead to ten.

They drove to the Clemson 27 before attempting a 45-yard field goal, which Cade York missed wide right. Lawrence and the Clemson offense were unable to capitalize on the mistake, however; they went three-and-out and punted to the LSU 43.

After taking 5:24 off the clock, LSU punted the ball back, and Clemson took over with just under five minutes left, on their own 15.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The initial stage of development had over 200 homes priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4999|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Alice |date=September 18, 1949 |title=$4,999 Two-Bedroom Home Draws Interest |page=25 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One resident, Patrick McMahan, became frustrated by these conditions, and organized a campaign to incorporate the community after [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]] declined to study an annexation.<ref>{{cite book |page=301 |ref=harv |last1=Cameron |first1=David A. |last2=LeWarne |first2=Charles P. |last3=May |first3=M.

Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />\n\n===Early growth===\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref>{{cite news |date=December 2014 |title=Mountlake Terrace Looking Back 60 Years & Beyond |url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/Archive/ViewFile/Item/2850 |work=City Happenings |publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Slowing of development===\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a \"stand-alone\" development with an economically vital downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall.<ref name=History />  However, this development halted in the 1980s. [[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area. West Plaza was out of business for 20 months; East Plaza was permanently shut down, replaced with a gymnastics center.}} In 1981, Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was repeatedly trimmed, but Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.<ref name=HistoryLink />\n\n===Recent history===\n[[Image:Mountlake Terrace 236th&56th.JPG|thumb|right|Intersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.]]\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize the downtown area and encourage economic activity.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />{{efn|The council approved design standards requiring that new developments be built with wide sidewalks, lots of windows, awnings, and interesting architectural details.}} As of 2013 the town's largest employer was [[Premera Blue Cross]], which employs some 3,000 people.<ref name=CAFR>[http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf City of Mountlake Terrace CAFR 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120444/http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The initial stage of development had over 200 homes priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4999|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Alice |date=September 18, 1949 |title=$4,999 Two-Bedroom Home Draws Interest |page=25 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth.

Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed.

Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959.

[[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area.

In elementary school, he would often interrupt the class to tell a joke. On one occasion, a classmate was moving to a different town that was not generally regarded well, and Jeselnik cracked a sarcastic comment: \"Oh, well, send us a postcard.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/> When the teacher laughed at his joke, he realized that \"if you're smart enough that adults get it, you can get away with anything.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He would often stay up attempting to watch ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and, as he grew older, ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' and ''[[Mr. Show]]''.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He graduated from [[Upper St. Clair High School]] in 1997. Jeselnik earned a bachelor's degree in English literature with a business minor from [[Tulane University]] in 2001. During his senior year at Tulane, his girlfriend accidentally burned down his apartment, which he would later use as early standup material.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He was a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity while at [[Tulane University]].

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XII and Russia", "text_new": "{{main|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\n'''Pope Pius XII and Russia''' describes relations of the [[Holy See|Vatican]] with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], the [[Orthodox Church]], and United Oriental Churches resulting in the eradication of the Church in most parts of the Soviet Union during the [[Stalinist]] era. Most [[persecution]]s of the Church occurred during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe relations of the Vatican with Russia are one element of the topic [[Persecutions against the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII]]. Equally destructive to the Church were the simultaneous persecutions of [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China|the Church in China]]\n\nRelations between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and the Holy See were always difficult, although at times both sides tried to show some flexibility. On January 23, 1918, the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana''<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313-317</ref> in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of [[communism]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''Miserantissimus Redemptor'',<ref>AAS 20 1928 165-178</ref> ''Caritate Christi'',<ref>AAS 24 1932 177-194</ref> and ''Divini Redemptoris.''<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65-106</ref>\n\n==The War years: 1941-1945 ==\nThe [[pontificate]] of Pius XII faced extraordinary problems. During the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred the Soviet authorities from persecuting all Christian churches within the Soviet Union as hostile to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after [[Germany]] occupied the western part of [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the eastern part along with the [[Baltic Countries]] including predominantly Catholic [[Lithuania]]. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the USSR. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some like the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Church are united with Rome which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pius XII, upholding the neutrality of the Holy See, had abstained from any criticisms of the Soviet Union as it was attacked by Germany. Contrary to many rumours, the Pope never called the war a crusade against communism, nor did he encourage the extension of the war into the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Russian people [[Sacro Vergente|''Sacro Vergente'']], he wrote that despite these Church persecutions during the war, he would not utter one word which could have been used unfairly. Despite growing pressure, he never condoned or approved a war against communism or against Russia in 1941.<ref>AAS 1952, 508</ref> Helping to save lives whenever possible, especially in Soviet and German occupied Poland, he did not issue protests when the allies in the East engaged in mass killings or deportations during the war.\n\n==  The destruction of Catholic Oriental Churches ==\n\nAfter the war, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of [[Joseph Stalin]], but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches which was united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] located in the Ukraine. Ruthenian Catholics call themselves Rusyns. They are closely related to the Ukrainians and speak a dialect of the same language. The traditional Rusyn homeland extends into northeast Slovakia and the Lemko region of southeast Poland. Until 1922, the area was largely a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. After becoming Polish, which follows the Latin rite, [[Polonisation]] and significant problems for all Orthodox, including united Christians developed.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\">Giovannetti, 112</ref><ref>Wikipedia Polonisation</ref> Some Ruthenians, resisting [[Polonisation]], felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI.\n\nAfter 1945, it was claimed that the union with Rome was a Polish conspiracy to dominate and wipe out the Oriental culture of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]: United orthodox faithful and priests had to suffer under Polish bishops of the Latin Rite and Polonisation. But they were apprehended by the [[Soviet Army]] under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and therefore, continued ties to Rome were made impossible.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\"/> The new [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] of Moscow called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union for a separation from Rome:\n\n* Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to the your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!<ref>Giovannetti,  115</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] replied: \"Who does not know, that [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter which contributes not a little to the persecution?\"<ref>AAS 1946,  Orientales omnes Ecclesias 57</ref> Pope Pius never shared Roosevelt's wartime optimism regarding Stalin's allegedly changed attitudes towards religious freedom and tolerance and related guarantees from the newly established [[United Nations]]. [[Orientales omnes Ecclesias|''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'']] refers to [[United Nations]] resolutions of a world of tolerance, free of religious persecution . Pius continues, \"This had given us hope that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church, the more so since the Church has always taught, and teaches, that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil power, within the sphere and bounds of its authority, is a duty of conscience. But, unfortunately, the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened, have almost destroyed, our hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are concerned.\"<ref>AAS 1946, Orientales omnes Ecclesias, 58</ref>\n\nThe Pope knew not only about the attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome. He also was aware that in months preceding the encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, and Josaphat Kocylovskyi. Some, including Bishop [[Nicetas Budka]], perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946. July 1, 1945, some three hundred priests of the United Church wrote to Molotov. They protested the arrest of all bishops and large parts of the Catholic clergy.<ref>Guglielmo de Vries, Oriente Cristiano, ieri e oggi, Roma, 270-275</ref> After the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's public presence in Russia was annihilated. Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi,  517</ref> After the war, the Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy, after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested on March 6, 1946.<ref>Adrianyi,  518</ref> The Catholic Church of Ukraine was thus liquidated. All properties were turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became a subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of [[de-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce results, aside from modest improvements in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1956. January 1958, [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which he claimed was identical with Kremlin policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref> The Vatican did not respond officially, and reported unofficial contacts will not be known until 2028, when Vatican Archives open access to all documents of the pontificate of Pius XII.\n\n== Pope Pius XII on Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church ==\n\nTwo months after his election on May 12, 1939, in ''Singolari Animi'', a papal letter to the Sacred Congregation of the Oriental Church, Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome, and prayed for those who suffer in their country, awaiting with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord.<ref>AAS 1939, 165</ref>\n\nThe encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'' is a summary of the relations between the united oriental churches and Rome until the persecutions 1945.Pope Pius presents a comprehensive historical review of the reunion, to show the many trials and bloody persecutions but also the advantages of the union to the faithful in Ukraine. In Sacro Vergente this history is repeated with view to relations with Russia in general. He again rejects [[communism]] but not [[communists]]. Those who err, are always welcome.<ref>AAS,1952,  509</ref> At Saint Josaphat College he mourns the terrible changes of the past twenty years in Russia, bishops incarcerated, in concentration camps, banned from their homes, killed while in jail, for one reason only, they are faithful to the Holy See.<ref>AAS,1952,  877</ref>\n\n[[Orientales Ecclesias]] reviews the efforts of the Vatican of improving relations with the oriental Churches. Pope Pius XII mentions the naming of the first ever Oriental Cardinal [[Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian]], and the reform of the Eastern [[Canon Law]] as two examples. But the most flourishing Christian communities are wiped out without trace these days. He does not know details except that many bishops and priests are deported to unknown destinations, to [[concentration camps]] and to jails, while some are under house arrest. AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 5 In Bulgaria, Bishop Bossilkoff was executed with many others. But Bulgaria is not alone. Many are robbed of the most basic natural and human rights, and mistreated in the most extreme ways. The suffering in Ukraine is immense.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 12</ref> The Pope refers specifically to the Kiev show trial against bishops of the oriental Church. Still there is reason for comfort and hope: The strength of the faithful. The Christian faith makes better citizens, who use their God-given freedom to work for their societies to further the causes of justice and unity.<ref>AAS 1952,  Orientales Ecclesias 19</ref> The Pope concludes by requesting worldwide public prayers for the persecuted, and hopes hat they may open the jails and loosen the chains in those countries.\n\n[[Novimus Nos]] is a letter to the bishops of the Oriental rite asking for faith, strength and hope. The Pope expresses his ardent desire for unity of all Eastern Christians with the Western church and comforts those who suffer in jail or unknown locations for their faith and faithfulness to the Holy See. In ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius reminds the whole world of the sufferings and persecutions in Russia and dedicates her to the special protection of Mary, who has so many Russian followers.\n\n** 1.\t''Singulari Animi, Apostolic Letter, May 12, 1939'', AAS 1939, 258\n** 2.\t''The 950th

the [[Holy See|Vatican]] with the [[Soviet Union]], [[Russia]], the [[Orthodox Church]], and United Oriental Churches resulting in the eradication of the Church in most parts of the Soviet Union during the [[Stalinist]] era. Most [[persecution]]s of the Church occurred during the [[pontificate]] of [[Pope Pius XII]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe relations of the Vatican with Russia are one element of the topic [[Persecutions against the Catholic Church and Pope Pius XII]]. Equally destructive to the Church were the simultaneous persecutions of [[Pope Pius XII and the Church in China|the Church in China]]\n\nRelations between [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities and the Holy See were always difficult, although at times both sides tried to show some flexibility. On January 23, 1918, the Soviet government declared separation of Church and State and began with the systematic dissolution of Catholic institutions and the confiscation of Catholic properties. Two years later, in 1920, [[Pope Benedict XV]] issued ''Bonum Sana''<ref>AAS 12, 1020, 313-317</ref> in which he condemned the philosophy and practices of [[communism]]. [[Pope Pius XI]] followed this line with numerous statements<ref>AAS 29, 1937, 67</ref> and the encyclicals ''Miserantissimus Redemptor'',<ref>AAS 20 1928 165-178</ref> ''Caritate Christi'',<ref>AAS 24 1932 177-194</ref> and ''Divini Redemptoris.''<ref>AAS 29, 1937 65-106</ref>\n\n==The War years: 1941-1945 ==\nThe [[pontificate]] of Pius XII faced extraordinary problems. During the 1930s, the public protests and condemnations of his predecessors had not deterred the Soviet authorities from persecuting all Christian churches within the Soviet Union as hostile to [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The persecution of the Catholic Church was a part of an overall attempt to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union. In 1940, after [[Germany]] occupied the western part of [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]] annexed the eastern part along with the [[Baltic Countries]] including predominantly Catholic [[Lithuania]]. Persecution began at once, as large parts of Poland and the Baltic States were incorporated into the USSR. Almost immediately, the United Catholic Churches of Armenia, Ukraine and Ruthenia were attacked. While most Oriental Christians belong to an Orthodox Church, some like the Armenian Catholic Church, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ruthenian Church are united with Rome which allowed them to keep their own Oriental liturgy and Church laws.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Pius XII, upholding the neutrality of the Holy See, had abstained from any criticisms of the Soviet Union as it was attacked by Germany. Contrary to many rumours, the Pope never called the war a crusade against communism, nor did he encourage the extension of the war into the Soviet Union. In his letter to the Russian people [[Sacro Vergente|''Sacro Vergente'']], he wrote that despite these Church persecutions during the war, he would not utter one word which could have been used unfairly. Despite growing pressure, he never condoned or approved a war against communism or against Russia in 1941.<ref>AAS 1952, 508</ref> Helping to save lives whenever possible, especially in Soviet and German occupied Poland, he did not issue protests when the allies in the East engaged in mass killings or deportations during the war.\n\n==  The destruction of Catholic Oriental Churches ==\n\nAfter the war, the Russian Orthodox Church was given some freedom by the government of [[Joseph Stalin]], but not the Orthodox Oriental Churches which was united with Rome. Leaders of the Orthodox Oriental Churches faced intense pressure to break with Rome and unite with Moscow. Pope Pius addressed specifically the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] located in the Ukraine. Ruthenian Catholics call themselves Rusyns. They are closely related to the Ukrainians and speak a dialect of the same language. The traditional Rusyn homeland extends into northeast Slovakia and the Lemko region of southeast Poland. Until 1922, the area was largely a part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. After becoming Polish, which follows the Latin rite, [[Polonisation]] and significant problems for all Orthodox, including united Christians developed.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\">Giovannetti, 112</ref><ref>Wikipedia Polonisation</ref> Some Ruthenians, resisting [[Polonisation]], felt deserted by the Vatican and returned to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] during the Pontificate of Pope Pius XI.\n\nAfter 1945, it was claimed that the union with Rome was a Polish conspiracy to dominate and wipe out the Oriental culture of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]: United orthodox faithful and priests had to suffer under Polish bishops of the Latin Rite and Polonisation. But they were apprehended by the [[Soviet Army]] under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, and therefore, continued ties to Rome were made impossible.<ref name=\"Giovannetti, 112\"/> The new [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] of Moscow called on all Catholics in the Soviet Union for a separation from Rome:\n\n* Liberate yourself! You must break the Vatican chains, which throw you into the abyss of error, darkness and spiritual decay. Hurry, return to the your true mother, the Russian Orthodox Church!<ref>Giovannetti,  115</ref>\n\n[[Pope Pius XII]] replied: \"Who does not know, that [[Patriarch Alexy I of Moscow|Patriarch Alexius I]] recently elected by the dissident bishops of Russia, openly exalts and preaches defection from the Catholic Church in a letter lately addressed to the Ruthenian Church, a letter, which contributes not a little to the persecution?\"<ref>AAS 1946,  Orientales omnes Ecclesias 57</ref> Pope Pius never shared Roosevelt's war time optimism regarding Stalin' allegedly changed attitudes towards religious freedom and tolerance and related guarantees from the newly established [[United Nations]]. [[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]] refers to [[United Nations]] resolutions of a world of tolerance, free of religious persecution . Pius continues, \"This had given us hope that peace and true liberty would be granted everywhere to the Catholic Church, the more so since the Church has always taught, and teaches, that obedience to the ordinances of the lawfully established civil power, within the sphere and bounds of its authority, is a duty of conscience. But, unfortunately, the events we have mentioned have grievously and bitterly weakened, have almost destroyed, our hope and confidence so far as the lands of the Ruthenians are concerned.\"<ref>AAS 1946, Orientales omnes Ecclesias, 58</ref>\n\nThe Pope knew not only about the attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome. He also was aware, that in months preceding the encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, and Josaphat Kocylovskyi. Some, including Bishop [[Nicetas Budka]], perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and Episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946. July 1, 1945, some three hundred priests of the United Church wrote to Molotov. They protested the arrest of all bishops and large parts of the Catholic clergy.<ref>Guglielmo de Vries, Oriente Cristiano, ieri e oggi, Roma, 270-275</ref> After the Church was thus robbed of all its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome, and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. Mass arrests of priests followed. In Lemko, some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945 Giovan<ref>netti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called, \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref>\n\nThe Catholic Church's public presence in Russia was annihilated. Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi,  517</ref> After the war, the Catholic United Churches were integrated under the Moscow Patriarchy, after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested on March 6, 1946.<ref>Adrianyi,  518</ref> The Catholic Church of Ukraine was thus liquidated. All properties were turned over to the Orthodox Church under the Patriarch of Moscow.\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"peaceful coexistence\" became subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for peaceful coexistence. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical cooperation, whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of [[de-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] did not produce results, aside from modest improvements in [[Poland]] and [[Yugoslavia]] after 1956. January 1958, [[Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed willingness of Moscow, to have formal relations with the Vatican in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on World peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position, which he claimed was identical with Kremlin policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref> The Vatican did not respond officially, and reported unofficial contacts will not be known until 2028, when Vatican Archives open access to all documents of the pontificate of Pius XII.\n\n== Pope Pius XII on Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church ==\n\nTwo months after his election on May 12, 1939, in ''Singolari Animi'', a papal letter to the Sacred Congregation of the Oriental Church, Pius XII reported again the persecutions of the Catholic faith in the Soviet Union. Three weeks later, while honouring the memory of Saint Vladimir on the 950th anniversary of his baptism, he welcomed Ruthenian priests and bishops and members of the Russian colony in Rome, and prayed for those who suffer in their country, awaiting with their tears the hour of the coming of the Lord.<ref>AAS 1939, 165</ref>\n\nThe encyclical ''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'' is a summary of the relations between the united oriental churches and Rome until the persecutions 1945.Pope Pius presents a comprehensive historical review of the reunion, to show the many trials and bloody persecutions but also the advantages of the union to the faithful in Ukraine. In Sacro Vergente this history is repeated with view to relations with Russia in general. He again rejects [[communism]] but not [[communists]]. Those who err, are always welcome.<ref>AAS,1952,  509</ref> At Saint Josaphat College he mourns the terrible changes of the past twenty years in Russia, bishops incarcerated, in concentration camps, banned from their homes, killed while in jail, for one reason only, they are faithful to the Holy See.<ref>AAS,1952,  877</ref>\n\n[[Orientales Ecclesias]] reviews the efforts of the Vatican of improving relations with the oriental Churches. Pope Pius XII mentions the naming of the first ever Oriental Cardinal [[Gr\u00e9goire-Pierre Agagianian]], and the reform of the Eastern [[Canon Law]] as two examples. But the most flourishing Christian communities are wiped out without trace these days. He does not know details except that many bishops and priests are deported to unknown destinations, to [[concentration camps]] and to jails, while some are under house arrest. AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 5 In Bulgaria, Bishop Bossilkoff was executed with many others. But Bulgaria is not alone. Many are robbed of the most basic natural and human rights, and mistreated in the most extreme ways. The suffering in Ukraine is immense.<ref>AAS 1952, Orientales Ecclesias 12</ref> The Pope refers specifically to the Kiev show trial against bishops of the oriental Church. Still there is reason for comfort and hope: The strength of the faithful. The Christian faith makes better citizens, who use their God-given freedom to work for their societies to further the causes of justice and unity.<ref>AAS 1952,  Orientales Ecclesias 19</ref> The Pope concludes by requesting worldwide public prayers for the persecuted, and hopes hat they may open the jails and loosen the chains in those countries.\n\n[[Novimus Nos]] is a letter to the bishops of the Oriental rite asking for faith, strength and hope. The Pope expresses his ardent desire for unity of all Eastern Christians with the Western church and comforts those who suffer in jail or unknown locations for their faith and faithfulness to the Holy See. In ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, Pope Pius reminds the whole world of the sufferings and persecutions in Russia and dedicates her to the special protection of Mary, who has so many Russian followers.\n\n** 1.\t''Singulari Animi, Apostolic Letter, May 12, 1939'', AAS 1939, 258\n** 2.\t''The 950th Anniversary of the Baptism of St Wladimir'', Discorsi 1939, 163\n** 3.\t[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]], Encyclical, AAS 1946, 33\n** 4.\t[[Sempiternus Rex]], Encyclical, September 8, 1951, AAS 1951, 624\n** 5.\t[[Sacro Vergente]], Apostolic letter, July 7, 1952, AAS 1952, 505\n** 6.\t''Speech to the St. Josaphat College'', December 15, 1952, AAS 1952, 876\n** 7.\t[[Orientales Ecclesias]], encyclical, December 15, 1952, AAS 1953, 5\n** 8.\t[[Novimus Nos]], Apostolic Letter, January 20, 1956, AAS 1956, 260\n** 9.\t[[Fulgens corona]] encyclical, September 8, 1954, AAS 1954, 577\n\n==''Operation Seat 12'' -
