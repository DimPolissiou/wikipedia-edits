Lewi's Philosophy of Life is that [[Destiny]], when multiplied by [[Free will]], creates Human life, which normally appears as a constant struggle between what is ([[Existence]]) and what ought ([[Essence]]) to be. Knowledge about [[Horoscope]] gives a glimpse into Destiny and allows for prospective planning of Free will (alternatives and choices) to create the best possible conditions of Human Life. Oke has written newspaper articles and authored books including one on the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac <ref name=\"manoranjak\" /> and another on the I Ching <ref name=\"mitra\"/> or the ancient Chinese divination text.

Lewi's Philosophy of Life is that [[Destiny]], when multiplied by [[Free will]], creates Human life, which normally appears as a constant struggle between what is ([[Existence]]) and what ought ([[Essence]]) to be. Knowledge about [[Horoscope]] gives a glimpse into Destiny and allows for prospective planning of Free will (alternatives and choices) to create the best possible conditions of Human Life. Oke has written newspaper articles and authored books including one on the 12 signs of the Chinese Zodiac <ref name=\"manoranjak\" /> and another on the I Ching <ref name=\"mitra\"/> or the ancient Chinese divination text.

Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name=\"bakerinstitute.org\" /> Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.<ref name=\"John, T.

On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.<ref name=\"pmid1500643\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985\u20131991 | journal = J.

This results in constitutive [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into ''V. cholerae'' by [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Virulent strains of ''V. cholerae'' carry a variant of a [[Temperateness (virology)|temperate]] [[bacteriophage]] called [[CTX\u03c6 Bacteriophage|CTX\u03c6]].\n\nMicrobiologists have studied the [[gene expression|genetic mechanisms]] by which the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall.<ref name=\"DiRita\">{{cite journal |vauthors=DiRita VJ, Parsot C, Jander G, Mekalanos JJ | title = Regulatory cascade controls virulence in Vibrio cholerae | journal = Proc.

The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.<ref name=\"DiRita\" /> Current{{when|date=August 2017}} research aims at discovering \"the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.\"<ref name=\"DiRita\" />\n\n=== Genetic structure ===\n{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}\n[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] [[DNA profiling|fingerprinting]] of the pandemic [[genetic isolate|isolates]] of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure.

From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of ''V. cholerae'' through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation.

Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name=\"bakerinstitute.org\" /> Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.<ref name=\"John, T.

Jacob 2004\" /> Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.<ref name=\"pmid1500643\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985\u20131991 | journal = J.
