The video largely revolves around a woman who is in the club looking for her boyfriend and is heartbroken when she sees him with another woman. The version on ''[[The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection]]'' is slightly different from the previous version (the version that is also included on the Mallay Believe Bonus VCD) with additional scenes towards the end that were not in the original video. There are also two 'rough' versions of the video as the song was released in the UK and Europe before a video was completed. The first is a compilation of scenes from the videos of Cher's previous singles \"One by One\" and \"Walking in Memphis\" and the second includes a brief scene of the Believe video where Cher sings the chorus while the rest of the video is composed of scenes from \"One by One\".\n\nThree official remix videos exist for this song. Two of the remix videos were created by Dan-O-Rama in 1999. Both follow different concepts from the original unmixed video. Instead of showing the significance of the lyrics the videos mostly show Cher with different colored backgrounds and people dancing. The two remixes used for these videos were the Almighty Definitive Mix and the Club 69 Phunk Club Mix. The third video entitled Wayne G. Remix was released by Warner Bros. and the concept is similar to the Club 69 Phunk Club Mix video.\n\n==Live performances==\nCher performed the song during the [[Do You Believe? (tour)|Do You Believe?]], [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|The Farewell Tour]], [[Cher at the Colosseum]] and the [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]]. While she would lip-sync the entire song on various television programs, she would only lip-sync the synthesized verses when performing on her Believe and Farewell tours, the Colosseum shows and on the 2002 edition of ''[[VH1 Divas Live]]''. Since 1999, the song has been the encore to all of Cher's concerts until her 2014 [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]], where the encore is the ballad \"[[I Hope You Find It]]\", a second single from her 25th studio album ''[[Closer to the Truth (Cher album)|Closer to the Truth]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944817/cher-delivers-classic-hits-outrageous-costumes-at-dazzling-dressed|title=Cher Delivers Classic Hits, Outrageous Costumes, at Dazzling 'Dressed to Kill' Tour Opener|author=Christina Fuoco-Karasinski|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 23, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> It returned as the encore at her [[Classic Cher]] (2017-2020) shows and stayed in that place for the [[Here We Go Again Tour]] (2018-2020) as well.\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[File:Cher Believe D2K.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Cher performing \"Believe\" on the [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]] in 2014.]]\n''[[VH1]]'' placed \"Believe\" at #60 in their list of '''100 Greatest Dance Songs''' in 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Dance Songs|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref> and at #74 in their list of '''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s''' in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Publisher\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Rank\n|-\n|2000\n|[[VH1]]\n|[[United States]]\n|\"100 Greatest Dance Songs\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Dance Songs|website=www.rockonthenet.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|60\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|[[United States]]\n|\"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1770 |title=The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born|accessdate=19 December 2019|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055432/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1770|archivedate=17 December 2007}}</ref>\n|134\n|-\n|2007\n|[[VH1]]\n|[[United States]]\n|\"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 90s|website=www.rockonthenet.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|74\n|-\n|2012\n|''[[NME]]''\n|[[United Kingdom]]\n|\"50 best-selling tracks of the \u201990s\"<ref>{{cite web|title=50 best-selling tracks of the \u201990s|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/50-best-selling-tracks-of-the-90s-1437045|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n|2015\n|Robert Dimery\n|[[United States]]\n|\"1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die, and 10,001 You Must Download (2015 Update)\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Cher -

Records]]. It was released as the [[lead single]] from the album on October 19, 1998. It was written by [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]], Stuart McLennen, [[Paul Barry (songwriter)|Paul Barry]], Steven Torch, Matthew Gray, [[Tim Powell (producer)|Timothy Powell]],<ref name=\"Ivors99\" /> and Cher,<ref name=\"Bego2004\">{{cite book|author=Mark Bego|title=Cher: If You Believe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIQcOufdLVUC&pg=PA283|date=15 July 2004|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|isbn=978-1-4616-2592-6|pages=283\u2013}}</ref> and was produced by [[Mark Taylor (music producer)|Mark Taylor]] and [[Brian Rawling]].\n\n\"Believe\" departed from Cher's [[pop rock]] style of the time for an upbeat [[dance-pop]] style. It featured a pioneering use of the audio processing software [[Auto-Tune]] to distort Cher's vocals, which became known as the \"Cher effect\". The lyrics describe empowerment and self-sufficiency after a painful breakup.\n\n\"Believe\" reached number one in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Scotland, New Zealand, Spain, Italy, Greece, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Switzerland, Poland and the Netherlands. It earned Cher a place in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the oldest female solo artist to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and became the highest-selling single by a solo female artist in the United Kingdom.

It was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and won [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]].\n\nThe music video, directed by [[Nigel Dick]], has Cher performing in a nightclub. Cher has performed the song a number of times, including four of her [[List of Cher concert tours|concert tours]], most recently the [[Here We Go Again Tour]] in 2018. It has been covered by a number of artists, and has been featured in several elements of popular culture. Scholars and academics noted the way in which Cher was able to re-invent herself and remain fresh and contemporary amidst the more [[teen pop]]-based music of the period. They also credited \"Believe\" for restoring Cher's popularity and cementing her position as a [[Pop icon|pop culture icon]].\n\n==Recording==\nA demo of \"Believe\", written by [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]], Matthew Gray, Stuart McLennen and [[Tim Powell (producer)|Timothy Powell]], circulated at Warner for months. According to producer [[Mark Taylor (music producer)|Mark Taylor]], \"everyone loved the chorus but not the rest of the song\". Warner chairman [[Rob Dickins]] asked the production house Dreamhouse to work on the song.

The video largely revolves around a woman who is in the club looking for her boyfriend and is heartbroken when she sees him with another woman. The version on ''[[The Very Best of Cher: The Video Hits Collection]]'' is slightly different from the previous version (the version that is also included on the Mallay Believe Bonus VCD) with additional scenes towards the end that were not in the original video. There are also two 'rough' versions of the video as the song was released in the UK and Europe before a video was completed. The first is a compilation of scenes from the videos of Cher's previous singles \"One by One\" and \"Walking in Memphis\" and the second includes a brief scene of the Believe video where Cher sings the chorus while the rest of the video is composed of scenes from \"One by One\".\n\nThree official remix videos exist for this song. Two of the remix videos were created by Dan-O-Rama in 1999. Both follow different concepts from the original unmixed video. Instead of showing the significance of the lyrics the videos mostly show Cher with different colored backgrounds and people dancing. The two remixes used for these videos were the Almighty Definitive Mix and the Club 69 Phunk Club Mix. The third video entitled Wayne G. Remix was released by Warner Bros. and the concept is similar to the Club 69 Phunk Club Mix video.\n\n==Live performances==\nCher performed the song during the [[Do You Believe? (tour)|Do You Believe?]], [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour|The Farewell Tour]], [[Cher at the Colosseum]] and the [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]]. While she would lip-sync the entire song on various television programs, she would only lip-sync the synthesized verses when performing on her Believe and Farewell tours, the Colosseum shows and on the 2002 edition of ''[[VH1 Divas Live]]''. Since 1999, the song has been the encore to all of Cher's concerts until her 2014 [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]], where the encore is the ballad \"[[I Hope You Find It]]\", a second single from her 25th studio album ''[[Closer to the Truth (Cher album)|Closer to the Truth]]''.<ref name=\"Synopsis\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5944817/cher-delivers-classic-hits-outrageous-costumes-at-dazzling-dressed|title=Cher Delivers Classic Hits, Outrageous Costumes, at Dazzling 'Dressed to Kill' Tour Opener|author=Christina Fuoco-Karasinski|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=March 23, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> It returned as the encore at her [[Classic Cher]] (2017-2020) shows and stayed in that place for the [[Here We Go Again Tour]] (2018-2020) as well.\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[File:Cher Believe D2K.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Cher performing \"Believe\" on the [[Dressed to Kill Tour (Cher)|Dressed to Kill Tour]] in 2014.]]\n''[[VH1]]'' placed \"Believe\" at #60 in their list of '''100 Greatest Dance Songs''' in 2000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Dance Songs|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref> and at #74 in their list of '''100 Greatest Songs of the 90's''' in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's|website=www.rockonthenet.com}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year\n!Publisher\n!Country\n!Accolade\n!Rank\n|-\n|2000\n|[[VH1]]\n|[[United States]]\n|\"100 Greatest Dance Songs\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1dance.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Dance Songs|website=www.rockonthenet.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|60\n|-\n|2005\n|''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|[[United States]]\n|\"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1770 |title=The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born|accessdate=19 December 2019|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217055432/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=1770|archivedate=17 December 2007}}</ref>\n|134\n|-\n|2007\n|[[VH1]]\n|[[United States]]\n|\"100 Greatest Songs of the 90's\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2007/vh190s.htm|title=Rock On The Net: VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the 90's|website=www.rockonthenet.com|accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>\n|74\n|-\n|2012\n|''[[NME]]''\n|[[United Kingdom]]\n|\"50 best-selling tracks of the \u201990s\"<ref>{{cite web|title=50 best-selling tracks of the \u201990s|url=https://www.nme.com/photos/50-best-selling-tracks-of-the-90s-1437045|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n|2015\n|Robert Dimery\n|[[United States]]\n|\"1,001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Die, and 10,001 You Must Download (2015 Update)\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Cher -

Three years later, Francis's father died when Francis was only nine years old. In 1516, Francis's brothers participated in a failed Navarrese-French attempt to expel the Spanish invaders from the kingdom. The Spanish Governor, Cardinal Cisneros, confiscated the family lands, demolished the outer wall, the gates, and two towers of the family castle, and filled in the moat. In addition, the height of the keep was reduced by half.<ref>Sagredo Garde, I\u00f1aki. ''Navarra. Castillos que defendieron el Reino''.

As a representative of the Portuguese king, he was received in a friendly manner. [[Shimazu Takahisa]] (1514\u20131571), ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of Satsuma, gave a friendly reception to Francis on 29 September 1549, but in the following year he forbade the conversion of his subjects to Christianity under penalty of death; Christians in Kagoshima could not be given any catechism in the following years. The Portuguese missionary Pedro de Alc\u00e1\u00e7ova would later write in 1554:\n\n<blockquote> In Cangoxima, the first place Father Master Francisco stopped at, there were a good number of Christians, although there was no one there to teach them; the shortage of labourers prevented the whole kingdom from becoming Christian.<ref name=\"Diego Pacheco 1974 pp. 477-480\"/> </blockquote>\n\nHe was hosted by Anjir\u014d's family until October 1550.<ref name=butler/> From October to December 1550, he resided in [[Yamaguchi, Yamaguchi|Yamaguchi]].

For a long time Francis struggled to learn the language.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nHaving learned that evangelical poverty did not have the appeal in Japan that it had in Europe and in India, he decided to change his approach. Hearing after a time that a Portuguese ship had arrived at a port in the province of Bungo in Kyushu and that the prince there would like to see him, Xavier now set out southward. The Jesuit, in a fine cassock, surplice, and stole, was attended by thirty gentlemen and as many servants, all in their best clothes. Five of them bore on cushions valuable articles, including a portrait of Our Lady and a pair of velvet slippers, these not gifts for the prince, but solemn offerings to Xavier, to impress the onlookers with his eminence. Handsomely dressed, with his companions acting as attendants, he presented himself before Oshindono, the ruler of Nagate, and as a representative of the great kingdom of Portugal, offered him letters and presents: a musical instrument, a watch, and other attractive objects which had been given him by the authorities in India for the emperor.<ref name=crawley />\n\nFor forty-five years the Jesuits were the only missionaries in Asia, but the Franciscans also began proselytising in Asia as well.

At this time, he was accompanied only by a Jesuit student, \u00c1lvaro Ferreira, a Chinese man called Ant\u00f3nio, and a [[Malabars|Malabar]] servant called Christopher. Around mid-November he sent a letter saying that a man had agreed to take him to the mainland in exchange for a large sum of money.

The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\n\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, [[Marg\u00e3o]], in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), [[Batpal]], [[Canacona]], Goa, and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\n\n====Other places====\nOther pilgrimage centres include Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of [[Il Gesu]], Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (Place of death), and more.\n\nXavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. In [[Magdalena de Kino]] in [[Sonora]], Mexico, in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre [[Eusebio Kino]] in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many in the region. Also [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\n\n===Novena of grace===\n{{further|Novena of Grace}}\n[[File:Unzenhell3.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Fumaroles at Mt. Unzen, Japan]]\nThe [[Novena of Grace]] is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary [[Marcello Mastrilli]]. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=17UZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Marcello%20Mastrilli&pg=PA234#v=onepage&q=Marcello%20Mastrilli&f=false \"Japanese Sketches\"] in ''The Month'', Volume 11 (1869) p.241</ref> Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from [[Mount Unzen|Mt. Unzen]], known as the ''Hell mouth'' or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.<ref>{{Cite book | isbn=978-0-674-02448-9|title = Journey to the East: The Jesuit Mission to China, 1579-1724|last1 = Brockey|first1 = Liam Matthew| year=2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:VisionStFrancisBoccacio.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Vision of St. Francis Xavier'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]\nFrancis Xavier is noteworthy for his [[missionary work]], both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since [[Paul the Apostle]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said of both [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from [[Paris]] and Rome, but a unique desire \u2013 a unique passion, it could be said \u2013 moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\"<ref name=benedict/> By consulting with the earlier ancient [[Christians of St. Thomas]] in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Timor]]). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools. Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. However, following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.\n\nA small chapel designed by [[Achille-Antoine Hermitte]] was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.\nIt was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth.<ref>{{citation |title=Achille-Antoine Hermitte's Surviving Building / \u963f\u57fa\u91cc\u2027 \u5b89\u7576\u2027 \u57c3\u723e\u7c73\u7279\u7684\u5016\u5b58\u5efa\u7bc9 |last1=Davies |last2=\u6234\u5049\u601d  |first1=Stephen|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |volume=56 |pages=92\u2013110 |year=2016 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |jstor=jroyaaisasocihkb.56.92}}</ref> \nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native [[Navarre]], which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the [[Javierada]], an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at [[Pamplona]] to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.\n\n===Namesake===\n[[File:Saint Francis Xavier statue, Jakarta Cathedral, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Santo Fransiskus Xaverius'', at Jesuit [[Jakarta Cathedral|''Gereja Katedral Santa Perawan Maria Diangkat Ke Surga'']], in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Statue of Staint Francis Xavier.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Saint Francis Xavier, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], [[United States]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier - Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos.png|thumb|upright|Effigy of Saint Francis Xavier in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Discoveries]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]]]\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, he is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where ''Francisco Javier'' or ''Javier'' are common male [[given names]].<ref name=\"INE\">''[http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/nombyapel/nombres_mas_frecuentes_en.xls The most frequent names, simple and exact for the national total and exact for the province of residence]'', [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica]].

Together, Javier becomes the 8th most frequent name for males.</ref> The alternative spelling ''Xavier'' is also popular in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], [[Portugal]], [[Catalonia]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], and southern [[Italy]]. In India, the spelling ''Xavier'' is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in [[Goa]] and the southern states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], and [[Karnataka]]. The names ''Francisco Xavier'', ''Ant\u00f3nio Xavier'', ''Jo\u00e3o Xavier'', ''Caetano Xavier'', ''Domingos Xavier'' et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. ''Fransiskus Xaverius'' is commonly used as a name for [[Indonesia]]n Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and [[Bavaria]] the name is spelled as ''Xaver'' (pronounced (\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250)) and often used in addition to Francis as ''Franz-Xaver'' (frant\u0361s\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\"; in the 2000s, however, \"Xavier\" by itself has become more popular than \"Francis\", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A.<ref name=\"ssa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=ssa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for [[John Sevier]], originated from the name Xavier.\n\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland)|St. Francis Xavier Shrine]] at [[Warwick, Maryland]] (founded 1720), and the [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] in [[Dyersville, Iowa]]. There are also the American educational teaching order [[Xaverian Brothers]], and the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] (founded in 1692, and known for its [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]).\n\n===In art===\n[[Rubens]] painted ''St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead'' for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles.<ref>Rubens, William Unger, S.

These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.<ref name=\"Ante Kadi\u010d 1961 pp. 12-18\"/></blockquote>\n\nModern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Church]], and used the [[Goa]] government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in [[Japan]] was subsequently destroyed by persecution, [[Protestant]] missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the [[Nagasaki]] area.<ref name=\"ctlibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/131christians/missionaries/xavier.html |title=Francis Xavier - Christian History &amp; Biography - ChristianityTodayLibrary.com |publisher=ctlibrary.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrancis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern [[Indonesia]], and he was known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" where in 1546\u20131547 he worked in the [[Maluku Islands]] among the people of [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Ternate]], and [[Morotai]] (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon.

He had written to King [[John III of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o III]] of Portugal in 1546, encouraging him to dispatch the Inquisition to Goa. Francis Xavier died in 1552 without living to see the horrors of the Goa Inquisition, but some historians believe that he was aware of the Portuguese Inquisition's brutality. In an interview to an Indian newspaper, historian [[Teot\u00f3nio de Souza]] stated that Francis Xavier and [[Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues]], another founder-member of the [[Society of Jesus]], were together in Lisbon before Francis left for India. Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric. Hence, he believes that Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition.<ref name=\"deccanherald\">{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/66330/xavier-aware-brutality-inquisition.html|title=Xavier was aware of the brutality of the Inquisition|publisher=deccanherald.com|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=2010-04-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Saints}}\n* [[Catholicism in China]]\n* [[Catholicism in Indonesia]]\n* [[Christianity in China]]\n* [[Christianity in Indonesia]]\n* [[Goa Inquisition]]\n* [[History of Roman Catholicism in Japan]]\n* [[Jesuit China missions]]\n* [[List of Westerners who visited Japan before 1868]]\n* [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] \u2014 San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, Arizona \n* [[Xaverian Brothers]] \u2014 religious order in America\n* [[Xavier High School (New York City)]]\n* [[Xavier School]] \u2014 [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan City]], Philippines\n* [[Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan]], Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines\n* [[St. Francis Xavier University]] - Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada\n* [[St. Xavier's Institution]] - Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia\n* [[Portal:Catholic Church/Patron Archive/December 3|Saint Francis Xavier, patron saint archive]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* This article incorporates material from the ''[[Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religion]]''\n* Attwater, Donald.

The sacred relics went on display starting on 22 November 2014 at the XVII Solemn Exposition. The display closed on 4 January 2015. The previous exposition, the sixteenth, was held from 21 November 2004 to 2 January 2005.\n\nRelics of Saint Francis Xavier are also found in the Espirito Santo (Holy Spirit) Church, [[Marg\u00e3o]], in Sanv Fransiku Xavierachi Igorz (Church of St. Francis Xavier), [[Batpal]], [[Canacona]], Goa, and at St. Francis Xavier Chapel, Portais, Panjim.\n\n====Other places====\nOther pilgrimage centres include Xavier's birthplace in Navarra, Church of [[Il Gesu]], Rome, Malacca (where he was buried for 2 years, before being brought to Goa), Sancian (Place of death), and more.\n\nXavier is a major venerated saint in both Sonora and the neighbouring U.S. state of [[Arizona]]. In [[Magdalena de Kino]] in [[Sonora]], Mexico, in the Church of Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena, there is reclining statue of San Francisco Xavier brought by pioneer Jesuit missionary Padre [[Eusebio Kino]] in the early 18th century. The statue is said to be miraculous and is the object of pilgrimage for many in the region. Also [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] is a pilgrimage site. The mission is an active parish church ministering to the people of the San Xavier District, Tohono O'odham Nation, and nearby Tucson, Arizona.\n\n===Novena of grace===\n{{further|Novena of Grace}}\n[[File:Unzenhell3.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Fumaroles at Mt. Unzen, Japan]]\nThe [[Novena of Grace]] is a popular devotion to Francis Xavier, typically prayed either on the nine days before 3 December, or on 4 March through 12 March (the anniversary of Pope Gregory XV's canonisation of Xavier in 1622). It began with the Italian Jesuit missionary [[Marcello Mastrilli]]. Before he could travel to the Far East, Mastrilli was gravely injured in a freak accident after a festive celebration dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Naples. Delirious and on the verge of death, Mastrilli saw Xavier, who he later said asked him to choose between travelling or death by holding the respective symbols, to which Mastrilli answered, \"I choose that which God wills.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=17UZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Marcello%20Mastrilli&pg=PA234#v=onepage&q=Marcello%20Mastrilli&f=false \"Japanese Sketches\"] in ''The Month'', Volume 11 (1869) p.241</ref> Upon regaining his health, Mastrilli made his way via Goa and the Philippines to Satsuma, Japan. The [[Tokugawa shogunate]] beheaded the missionary in October 1637, after undergoing three days of tortures involving the volcanic sulphurous fumes from [[Mount Unzen|Mt. Unzen]], known as the ''Hell mouth'' or \"pit\" that had supposedly caused an earlier missionary to renounce his faith.<ref>{{Cite book | isbn=978-0-674-02448-9|title = Journey to the East: The Jesuit Mission to China, 1579-1724|last1 = Brockey|first1 = Liam Matthew| year=2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:VisionStFrancisBoccacio.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Vision of St. Francis Xavier'', by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]]]]\nFrancis Xavier is noteworthy for his [[missionary work]], both as organiser and as pioneer, reputed to have converted more people than anyone else has done since [[Paul the Apostle]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said of both [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and Francis Xavier: \"not only their history which was interwoven for many years from [[Paris]] and Rome, but a unique desire \u2013 a unique passion, it could be said \u2013 moved and sustained them through different human events: the passion to give to God-Trinity a glory always greater and to work for the proclamation of the Gospel of Christ to the peoples who had been ignored.\"<ref name=benedict/> By consulting with the earlier ancient [[Christians of St. Thomas]] in India, Xavier developed Jesuit missionary methods. His success also spurred many Europeans to join the order, as well as become missionaries throughout the world. His personal efforts most affected Christians in [[India]] and the [[East Indies]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Timor]]). India still has numerous Jesuit missions, and many more schools. Xavier also worked to propagate Christianity in [[China]] and [[Japan]]. However, following the persecutions of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and the subsequent closing of Japan to foreigners, the Christians of Japan were forced to go underground to develop an independent Christian culture. Likewise, while Xavier inspired many missionaries to China, Chinese Christians also were forced underground and developed their own Christian culture.\n\nA small chapel designed by [[Achille-Antoine Hermitte]] was completed in 1869 over Xavier's death place on Shangchuan Island, Canton.\nIt was damaged and restored several times, with the most recent restoration in 2006 to celebrate the 500th anniversary of his birth.<ref>{{citation |title=Achille-Antoine Hermitte's Surviving Building / \u963f\u57fa\u91cc\u2027 \u5b89\u7576\u2027 \u57c3\u723e\u7c73\u7279\u7684\u5016\u5b58\u5efa\u7bc9 |last1=Davies |last2=\u6234\u5049\u601d  |first1=Stephen|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |volume=56 |pages=92\u2013110 |year=2016 |publisher=Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch |jstor=jroyaaisasocihkb.56.92}}</ref> \nFrancis Xavier is the patron saint of his native [[Navarre]], which celebrates his feast day on 3 December as a government holiday. In addition to Roman Catholic Masses remembering Xavier on that day (now known as the Day of Navarra), celebrations in the surrounding weeks honour the region's cultural heritage. Furthermore, in the 1940s, devoted Catholics instituted the [[Javierada]], an annual day-long pilgrimage (often on foot) from the capital at [[Pamplona]] to Xavier, where the Jesuits have built a basilica and museum and restored his family's castle.\n\n===Namesake===\n[[File:Saint Francis Xavier statue, Jakarta Cathedral, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Santo Fransiskus Xaverius'', at Jesuit [[Jakarta Cathedral|''Gereja Katedral Santa Perawan Maria Diangkat Ke Surga'']], in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n[[File:Statue of Staint Francis Xavier.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Saint Francis Xavier, at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, in [[Superior, Wisconsin]], [[United States]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier - Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos.png|thumb|upright|Effigy of Saint Francis Xavier in the [[Padr\u00e3o dos Descobrimentos|Monument to the Discoveries]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]]]\nAs the foremost saint from Navarre and one of the main Jesuit saints, he is much venerated in Spain and the Hispanic countries where ''Francisco Javier'' or ''Javier'' are common male [[given names]].<ref name=\"INE\">''[http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/nombyapel/nombres_mas_frecuentes_en.xls The most frequent names, simple and exact for the national total and exact for the province of residence]'', [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica]].

In India, the spelling ''Xavier'' is almost always used, and the name is quite common among Christians, especially in [[Goa]] and the southern states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], and [[Karnataka]]. The names ''Francisco Xavier'', ''Ant\u00f3nio Xavier'', ''Jo\u00e3o Xavier'', ''Caetano Xavier'', ''Domingos Xavier'' et cetera, were very common till quite recently in Goa. ''Fransiskus Xaverius'' is commonly used as a name for [[Indonesia]]n Catholics, usually abbreviated as FX. In Austria and [[Bavaria]] the name is spelled as ''Xaver'' (pronounced (\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250)) and often used in addition to Francis as ''Franz-Xaver'' (frant\u0361s\u02c8k\u0361sa\u02d0f\u0250). Many Catalan men are named for him, often using the two-name combination Francesc Xavier. In English speaking countries, \"Xavier\" until recently was likely to follow \"Francis\"; in the 2000s, however, \"Xavier\" by itself has become more popular than \"Francis\", and since 2001 is now one of the hundred most common male baby names in the U.S.A.<ref name=\"ssa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/ |title=Popular Baby Names |publisher=ssa.gov|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Furthermore, the Sevier family name, possibly most famous in the United States for [[John Sevier]], originated from the name Xavier.\n\nMany churches all over the world, often founded by Jesuits, have been named in honour of Xavier. The many in the United States include the historic [[St. Francis Xavier Church (Warwick, Maryland)|St. Francis Xavier Shrine]] at [[Warwick, Maryland]] (founded 1720), and the [[Basilica of St. Francis Xavier]] in [[Dyersville, Iowa]]. There are also the American educational teaching order [[Xaverian Brothers]], and the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] (founded in 1692, and known for its [[Spanish Colonial architecture]]).\n\n===In art===\n[[Rubens]] painted ''St Francis Xavier Raising the Dead'' for a Jesuit church in Antwerp, in which he depicted one of St Francis's many miracles.<ref>Rubens, William Unger, S.

These are the living books by which you are to study, both for your preaching and for your own consolation. I do not say that you should not on occasion read written books... to support what you say against vices with authorities from the Holy Scriptures and examples from the lives of the saints.<ref name=\"Ante Kadi\u010d 1961 pp. 12-18\"/></blockquote>\n\nModern scholars place the number of people converted to Christianity by Francis Xavier at around 30,000. And while some of Xavier's methods have been since criticised (he forced converts to take [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] names and dress in Western clothes, approved the persecution of the [[Eastern Orthodox|Eastern Church]], and used the [[Goa]] government as a missionary tool), he has also earned praise. He insisted that missionaries adapt to many of the customs, and most certainly the language, of the culture they wish to evangelise. And unlike later missionaries, Xavier supported an educated native clergy. Though for a time it seemed his work in [[Japan]] was subsequently destroyed by persecution, [[Protestant]] missionaries three centuries later discovered that approximately 100,000 Christians still practised in the [[Nagasaki]] area.<ref name=\"ctlibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/131christians/missionaries/xavier.html |title=Francis Xavier - Christian History &amp; Biography - ChristianityTodayLibrary.com |publisher=ctlibrary.com|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrancis Xavier's work initiated permanent change in eastern [[Indonesia]], and he was known as the \"Apostle of the Indies\" where in 1546\u20131547 he worked in the [[Maluku Islands]] among the people of [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Ternate]], and [[Morotai]] (or Moro), and laid the foundations for a permanent mission. After he left the Maluku Islands, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Roman Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon.

He had written to King [[John III of Portugal|Jo\u00e3o III]] of Portugal in 1546, encouraging him to dispatch the Inquisition to Goa. Francis Xavier died in 1552 without living to see the horrors of the Goa Inquisition, but some historians believe that he was aware of the Portuguese Inquisition's brutality. In an interview to an Indian newspaper, historian [[Teot\u00f3nio de Souza]] stated that Francis Xavier and [[Sim\u00e3o Rodrigues]], another founder-member of the [[Society of Jesus]], were together in Lisbon before Francis left for India. Both were asked to assist spiritually the prisoners of the Inquisition and were present at the very first [[auto-da-f\u00e9]] celebrated in Portugal in September 1540, at which 23 were absolved and two were condemned to be burnt, including a French cleric.

Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers ''Lark'', ''Polarbjoern'', and ''Selis'' reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of [[Charles Francis Hall]]) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\"<ref>Forbes, 59\u201365</ref> They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.<ref>Hubbard Report</ref>\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland [[Baffin Island]]. On 30 July, ships ''Polaris'' and ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'' anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\"<ref>Forbes, 71</ref> The expedition consisted further of the [[USS Bear (1874)|USCGC ''Bear'']], equipped with a seaplane, the transports ''Fairfax'' and ''Eleanor'' and some smaller vessels. Having offloaded the airport construction crews and materials, the expedition left at the end of September.\n[[File:Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, aeronautical chart section.jpg|thumb|Frobisher Bay airport approaches with original station sites noted. USDOD ONC D-15, 1971]]\n\n===World War II===\nBy summer of 1943, the airbase at Koojesse Inlet had \"grown to look like a populous village\" and was in use by many aircraft.<ref>Forbes, 116</ref> It was designated Crystal II and referred to as ''Chaplet'' in coded communications. It was one of three \"Crystal\" weather sites in the Canadian Arctic Region, [[Kuujjuaq|Fort Chimo]] (now Kuujjuaq), [[Quebec]] being \"Crystal I\", and a station on [[Padloping Island]] being \"Crystal III\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] (ATC) took up residence at the station on October 1, 1942.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00076387|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230904/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/387.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nAs part of the [[Crimson Route|Crimson East]] air route network, the airfield at Crystal II was referred to by USAAF Air Transport Command as ATC Station #10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|title=USAFHRA Document 00180777|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724230910/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/180/777.xml|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> It was intended to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at [[Presque Isle Air Force Base|Presque Isle Army Airfield]], Maine and the Central Route, which originated at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Romulus Army Airfield]] (Detroit Airport), Michigan. The original plan, briefed by Captain Roosevelt to USAAF Chief [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] and others at the [[Argentia]] summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from [[Churchill, Manitoba]] via [[Southampton Island]] over Frobisher to [[Sondrestrom Air Base|Bluie West Eight]] and [[Bluie East Two]] in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland.<ref>Hansen, 199\u2013200, 211\u2013215</ref> The later success of the main air route via [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]] and the spring 1943 victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|title=AFHRA Document 00076350|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811063933/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|archivedate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) in 1948, under its [[Air Weather Service]]. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the  \n[[United States]] and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\n===Civilian use===\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] for airlines flying the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Crews departing westward from [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] or [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in those years preferred to route via [[Iceland]] (or the [[Azores]]) to [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], thence to [[New York City]] or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. In 1959 [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, [[Nordair]] was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, {{Convert|1100|NM}} to the south. [[Douglas DC-4]]s operated into the 1970s and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]]s between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of [[de Havilland Canada]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s and [[Douglas DC-3]]s was serving many small [[Arctic]] communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|BAe 748]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with [[Air Canada]] and [[Canadian Airlines]] rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the [[Canadian North]] banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the [[Inuit]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four [[Boeing 727]]s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small [[Yellowknife]]-based carrier, Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In acquiring NWT Air First Air obtained two 737-200 [[Combi aircraft|Combi]]s and a Lockheed [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|382 Hercules]].<ref>''Airways'' (June 2006) ''Pages 24-28'' ''YFB and First Air''</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n*2 hangar/cargo terminals (Canadian North) - hangar was terminal building until 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\">{{cite web|url=https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|title=Protected Blog \u203a Log in|author=|date=|website=chriswindeyer.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107023956/https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*1 two-storey terminal building c. 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\"/>\n*1 main runway\n*three aprons\n*1 FBO (Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services)\n*administration and control tower (former terminal)\n\nIqaluit International Airport Fire Department operates one crash tender for local fire suppression and has support from [[Iqaluit Fire Department]] when needed.\n\n==Terminal==\nThe main terminal (c.1986) has:\n*Check-in desks\n*3 gates\n*1 baggage claim belt\n*Gift shop\n*Travel agent\n*Tourist help desk\n*Car rental\n*Taxi service/rank\n*Baby/parent room\n*Disabled access/facilities\n*30 short term parking spaces\n* display cases for local artwork\n\nAs a result of increased traffic, limited post-security waiting area<ref name=\"case study\">{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Kloepfer |title=An airport public\u2013private partnership in the Canadian Arctic |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |publisher=Journal of Airport Management |year=2017 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=136\u2013146 |journal= |access-date=2019-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421044303/https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |archive-date=2019-04-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> and subsiding taxiway,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Greg A. |last1=Oldenborger |first2=Anne-Marie |last2=LeBlanc |title=Geophysical characterization of permafrost terrain at Iqaluit International Airport, Nunavut |journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics |year=2015 |volume=123 |pages=36\u201349 |doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.09.016}}</ref> the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250\u2013300 million.

The landing was executed safely - the first [[Boeing 747]] ever to attempt to land at Iqaluit - but one of the 747's engines hit a fuel pump on the tarmac as it was taxiing, causing serious damage to the aircraft and a potentially dangerous fuel spill. The 397 stranded passengers, including singer [[Gary Barlow]], were flown out after Virgin Atlantic chartered two jets. The passengers, after spending 16 hours in a local [[curling]] rink, were taken to New York to catch connecting flights to Los Angeles. [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who had also been on the flight, was given a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] escort and departed on an earlier scheduled flight.

Roosevelt's report designated a marginal site at Cape Rammelsberg for later construction. In mid-October, trawlers ''Lark'', ''Polarbjoern'', and ''Selis'' reached the vicinity, but owing to inaccurate charts (dating from the 1865 expedition of [[Charles Francis Hall]]) could not find the Roosevelt site. Instead, an eight-man crew commanded by USAAF Captain John T. Crowell was offloaded on a smaller island \"about eight miles southeast of the headland Captain Roosevelt had recommended.\"<ref>Forbes, 59\u201365</ref> They operated a weather/radio station over the winter. The expedition reported that \"this island is reported to be some 400 feet high and very level on top providing a natural runway of more than a mile in length.\" The ships left on 5 November.<ref>Hubbard Report</ref>\n\nWhen the station relief and base construction expedition arrived next July, both the Crowell and Roosevelt sites were rejected in favour of a level meadow discovered along the Sylvia Grinnell River on mainland [[Baffin Island]]. On 30 July, ships ''Polaris'' and ''[[Effie M. Morrissey]]'' anchored in what was then called Koojesse Inlet and began surveying the area: \"The terrain was excellent, with level ground extending nearly the entire 6,000 feet needed for an ample runway...The harbor, readily accessible from the bay, offered a good anchorage for ships of any size that would come in.\"<ref>Forbes, 71</ref> The expedition consisted further of the [[USS Bear (1874)|USCGC ''Bear'']], equipped with a seaplane, the transports ''Fairfax'' and ''Eleanor'' and some smaller vessels.

Arnold|Henry \"Hap\" Arnold]] and others at the [[Argentia]] summit in August 1941, called for Frobisher Bay to be a node in a northern alternate air route, running from [[Churchill, Manitoba]] via [[Southampton Island]] over Frobisher to [[Sondrestrom Air Base|Bluie West Eight]] and [[Bluie East Two]] in Greenland, rejoining the main route in Iceland.<ref>Hansen, 199\u2013200, 211\u2013215</ref> The later success of the main air route via [[Narsarsuaq Air Base|Bluie West One]] and the spring 1943 victory in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] led to cancelation of the Crimson project in late 1943, and the associated airfields were reduced to weather, communications, and logistics duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|title=AFHRA Document 00076350|website=airforcehistoryindex.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811063933/http://airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/076/350.xml|archivedate=11 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe use of Frobisher Bay declined with the end of World War II, with jurisdiction of the facility being transferred to [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) in 1948, under its [[Air Weather Service]]. During the 1950s it continued to be used as a transit point by the  \n[[United States]] and Canada. The base was closed in 1963 and converted into a civilian airport.\n\n===Civilian use===\nSince the 1950s, Frobisher Bay had earned a reputation{{by whom|date=July 2018}} as a [[wiktionary:technical stop|technical stop]] for airlines flying the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]]. Crews departing westward from [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Prestwick]] or [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] in those years preferred to route via [[Iceland]] (or the [[Azores]]) to [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], thence to [[New York City]] or elsewhere. Weather, however, could dictate a northerly course, which is when Frobisher Bay came into its own. In 1959 [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] even had a base there and on at least two occasions had to change engines on [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs at Frobisher Bay.\n\nWith the introduction of the intercontinental [[Boeing 707]] and [[Douglas DC-8]], fewer airlines stopped at Iqaluit. Even so, there always seemed to be some activity.{{according to|date=July 2018}} The place remained prominent as a regional airport, continued in its strategic role of sustaining the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW), supported the occasional military exercise or scientific expedition, and was still{{when|date=July 2018}} a key stopover on the North Atlantic ferry route.\n\nThrough the 1960s, [[Nordair]] was the main airline serving Frobisher Bay from Montreal, {{Convert|1100|NM}} to the south. [[Douglas DC-4]]s operated into the 1970s and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellation]]s between 1964 and 1969. In 1968 Nordair introduced the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] on the Frobisher Bay run. At the same time, Bradley Air Services had been expanding. By the 1970s, the company's fleet of [[de Havilland Canada]] [[de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter|DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s and [[Douglas DC-3]]s was serving many small [[Arctic]] communities from YFB, carrying passengers, mail, groceries, and other essentials. Bradley became known as First Air in 1973 and soon added [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748|BAe 748]]s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Canada's airline industry was in transition, with [[Air Canada]] and [[Canadian Airlines]] rapidly buying up regional operators. Air Canada acquired Nordair in 1977, and then sold it in 1984 to Canadian Airlines. Jet service to Iqaluit Airport continued, but under the [[Canadian North]] banner, which was, after the buyout of Canadian Airlines by Air Canada, to continue operations as an independent airline, jointly owned by the [[Inuit]] of the [[Northwest Territories]] and Nunavut. Between 1985 and 1988 First Air added four [[Boeing 727]]s to link Montreal and Ottawa with Iqaluit. Meanwhile, Canadian Airlines failed, and was taken over by Air Canada in 2000. In 1995 First Air purchased the small [[Yellowknife]]-based carrier, Ptarmigan Airways; then, in 1997, Northwest Territorial Airways (NWT Air), Air Canada's Yellowknife subsidiary. In acquiring NWT Air First Air obtained two 737-200 [[Combi aircraft|Combi]]s and a Lockheed [[Lockheed L-100 Hercules|382 Hercules]].<ref>''Airways'' (June 2006) ''Pages 24-28'' ''YFB and First Air''</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n*2 hangar/cargo terminals (Canadian North) - hangar was terminal building until 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\">{{cite web|url=https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|title=Protected Blog \u203a Log in|author=|date=|website=chriswindeyer.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107023956/https://chriswindeyer.com/writing/the-new-iqaluit-airport/|archive-date=7 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*1 two-storey terminal building c. 1986<ref name=\"chriswindeyer.com\"/>\n*1 main runway\n*three aprons\n*1 FBO (Frobisher Bay Touchdown Services)\n*administration and control tower (former terminal)\n\nIqaluit International Airport Fire Department operates one crash tender for local fire suppression and has support from [[Iqaluit Fire Department]] when needed.\n\n==Terminal==\nThe main terminal (c.1986) has:\n*Check-in desks\n*3 gates\n*1 baggage claim belt\n*Gift shop\n*Travel agent\n*Tourist help desk\n*Car rental\n*Taxi service/rank\n*Baby/parent room\n*Disabled access/facilities\n*30 short term parking spaces\n* display cases for local artwork\n\nAs a result of increased traffic, limited post-security waiting area<ref name=\"case study\">{{cite journal |first=Catherine |last=Kloepfer |title=An airport public\u2013private partnership in the Canadian Arctic |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |publisher=Journal of Airport Management |year=2017 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=136\u2013146 |journal= |access-date=2019-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421044303/https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000002/art00004 |archive-date=2019-04-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> and subsiding taxiway,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Greg A. |last1=Oldenborger |first2=Anne-Marie |last2=LeBlanc |title=Geophysical characterization of permafrost terrain at Iqaluit International Airport, Nunavut |journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics |year=2015 |volume=123 |pages=36\u201349 |doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2015.09.016}}</ref> the Nunavut government planned an overhaul of the airport that was expected to cost $250\u2013300 million.

The first mechanism is viral transmission through bee feces, which remains on the hive floor and can be picked up on the furry legs of other bees and ingested orally<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ribi\u00e8re|first=M.|last2=Lallemand|first2=P.|last3=Iscache|first3=A.-L.|last4=Schurr|first4=F.|last5=Celle|first5=O.|last6=Blanchard|first6=P.|last7=Olivier|first7=V.|last8=Faucon|first8=J.-P.|date=2007-12-01|title=Spread of Infectious Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus by Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.)

The second mechanism is through close contact between bees in the hive. [[Worker bee|Worker bees]] are the most susceptible to infection, since they travel the hive most frequently. The infection may spread between hives as a result of indirect contact or direct contact between honey bees<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ribiere|first1=M.|last2=Lallemand|first2=P.|last3=Iscache|first3=A.-L.|last4=Schurr|first4=F.|last5=Celle|first5=O.|last6=Blanchard|first6=P.|last7=Olivier|first7=V.|last8=Faucon|first8=J.-P.|date=12 October 2007|title=Spread of infections chronic bee paralysis virus by honeybee (''Apis mellifera'' L.) feces|journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]]|volume=73|issue=23|pages=7711\u20137716|doi=10.1128/AEM.01053-07|pmc=2168079|pmid=17933946}}</ref>. [[Research]] shows that mainly adult honey bees can be infected with chronic bee paralysis virus by a topical contact with infected feces or by ingestion of [[Virus|virion]]-containing substances<ref name=\"ribiere magali\" />.\n\n=== Viral replication cycle ===\n\n==== Entry into cell ====\nChronic bee paralysis virus is transmitted to honey bees through a [[Omnipresence|ubiquitous]] [[Parasitism|parasite]] common to honey bee hives, Varroa mites (''[[Varroa jacobsoni]]''). Varroa mites are known to harbor many viruses for which honey bees are susceptible and permissive<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.honeybeesuite.com/chronic-bee-paralysis-virus/|title=Chronic bee paralysis virus|date=2010-08-18|website=Honey Bee Suite|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>.The parasitic mites attach themselves to honey bees externally and feed off of the [[hemolymph]] of their hosts<ref name=\":2\" />. This exchange of fluids between the parasitic mites and the hosts allows for CBPV particles to enter fluid transfer systems in the honey bee body. The mechanisms by which chronic bee paralysis virus gains entry into honey bee cells is currently unknown.\n\n==== Replication ====\nLike other [[(+)ssRNA|positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses]], Chronic bee paralysis virus replicates in the [[cytoplasm]] of honeybee cells. The first large (+) RNA fragment in the CBPV [[genome]] likely encodes for an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]], which makes many copies of viral RNA. After many copies of the genome have been produced, the honey bee host's cellular processes will translate the viral RNA into functional [[Protein|proteins]] which can cause propagation of the virus inside the host. The virus replicates at the highest levels in the head of the honeybee, reaching an average of 10<sup>7</sup> copies of the virus in an infected worker bee head and as many as 10<sup>11</sup> copies of the virus in an infected [[queen bee]] head. Chronic bee paralysis virus particles have been found to concentrate in two centers; in [[mushroom bodies]] which play a role in sensory processing, [[memory]], and learning as well as in the central body, which plays a vital role in coordinating movement. Loss of flying ability in honey bees as a result of CBPV infection can be attributed to neuron destruction in the central body. Erratic behavior in infected bees may be a result of mushroom body neuron destruction. \n\n==== Symptoms ====\nInfected honeybees will begin to show symptoms of the illness within five days of infection, and the infection presents in two distinct ways, with Type I infection being the more common of the two infection types. \n\nA Type I infected bee presents with a bloated abdomen due to a fluid-filled honey sac and weak or trembling wings. Type I infected honey bees tend to crawl on the ground or cluster near the entrance of the hive, as their weakened wings lead to an inability to fly.\n\nA Type II infected honey bee presents with complete abdominal hair loss, causing it to appear black and greasy. These bees are still able to fly 2-3 days after symptoms begin to appear, but they lose their ability to fly shortly before succumbing to the disease.\n\nA third type of infection that is a major contributor to the spread of the virus is an infection of CBPV in which the infected bee exhibits no symptoms of the illness. The infected bee does not present with any of the classic symptoms of the disease before death, and, as a result, is able to transmit the virus beyond its own hive.\n\n==== Treatment ====\nThere is no known treatment for the disease currently. Often, infections of chronic bee paralysis virus die out on their own, but infected bees, if detected, must be removed from the hive immediately to lessen the chances of the virus spreading. Supplementing a smaller hive that has been severely affected by the virus with healthy bees from another colony can prevent colony collapse in struggling hives. The infection commonly surges in the winters rather than warmer months, for unknown reasons<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nTreating the hive against Varroa mites has also proven to be an effective preventive method against viral infection<ref name=\":2\" />. While bees should not be medicated against mites as a preventative measure because mites are quick to develop resistance; however, once detected, mites can be eliminated with the use of [[pesticides]]. Common pesticides include [[Apistan]], [[Formic acid|Formic Acid]], [[Thymol|Apiguard]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dummies.com/home-garden/hobby-farming/beekeeping/how-to-control-a-varroa-mite-problem-in-your-beehive/|title=How to Control a Varroa Mite Problem in Your Beehive|website=dummies|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>. Home remedies for exterminating mites in a bee hive also include dusting the hive floors as well as the honey bees themselves with powdered sugar in order to suffocate the mites<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\n== Testing ==\nChronic bee paralysis virus is classified as an [[Subclinical infection|inapparent infection]] because there are few tell-tale symptoms that appear before the infection has progressed to a fatal degree. As many honey bees can become infected and either show symptoms days after the initial point of infection or fail to show any symptoms throughout the entire course of the illness, CBPV can infect entire hives before the virus is detected. Despite the use of [[infectivity]] and [[Serology|serological tests]], these testing methods are often inaccurate and difficult to reproduce with consistent results.<ref name=\"ribiere magali\" />\n\n== Symbiotic relationships ==\nAlthough Chronic bee paralysis virus mainly infects honey bees, the virus has also been found to replicate in two species of [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[ant]], ''[[Camponotus vagus]]'' and ''[[Formica rufa]]''.These carnivorous ants become infected with CBPV through two mechanisms: eating decomposing bees who harbor the virus or by independently collecting infected honeydew.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=Celle|first1=Olivier|last2=Blanchard|first2=Philippe|last3=Olivier|first3=Violaine|last4=Schurr|first4=Frank|last5=Cougoule|first5=Nicolas|last6=Faucon|first6=Jean-Paul|last7=Ribi\u00e8re|first7=Magali|date=May 2008|title=Detection of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) genome and its replicative RNA form in various hosts and possible ways of spread|url=https://hal-anses.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00414769/file/Detection_of_Chronic_bee_paralysis_virus_in_various_hosts_version_HAL_210909.pdf|journal=Virus Research|volume=133|issue=2|pages=280\u2013284|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.011|pmid=18243390}}</ref>  While the virus does not cause any symptoms in the carnivorous ants, the [[Commensalism|commensal relationship]] between the virus and the ants allows the ants to serve as a reservoir for viral replication to occur<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\nChronic bee paralysis virus is also similar to [[slow bee paralysis virus]] and [[acute bee paralysis virus]]. Though CBPV does not fall into the same family as the other two viruses, it bears similarities to the other viruses because it causes paralysis as the fatal symptom of the infection. Slow bee paralysis, in contrast to Chronic bee paralysis virus, causes paralysis of the front two pairs of legs on honey bees ([[Apis mellifera cypria|''Apis mellifera'']]), silkworms ([[Bombyx mori|''Bombyx mori'']]'')'', and bumble bees ([[Bombus sylvarum|''Bombis spp.'']]'')''. This paralysis eventually causes death in the infected insects. Slow bee paralysis virus is transmitted to hives through ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' mite infestations. Because of the similarities between the two viruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus is suspected to have the same mode of transmission.\n\nChronic bee paralysis virus is also seen to interact with satellite viruses. The three short RNA segments of the viral genome are thought to be a satellite virus<ref name=\":4\" />. Only in the presence of CBPV can the associated satellite virus proliferate.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q16662559}}\n\n[[Category:Bee diseases]]\n[[Category:Insect viral diseases]]\n[[Category:Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses]]\n[[Category:Beekeeping]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| virus_group = iv\n| image = \n| image_caption = \n| ordo = [[Picornavirales]]\n| familia = N/A\n| genus = N/A\n| species = '''Chronic bee paralysis virus'''\n}}\n'''Chronic bee paralysis satellite virus (CBPV)''', not to be confused with [[slow bee paralysis virus]] (SBPV) or [[acute bee paralysis virus]] (ABPV), commonly affects adult [[Apis mellifera cypria|''Apis mellifera'']] honey bees and causes a chronic paralysis that can easily spread to other members of a colony.

The first mechanism is viral transmission through bee feces, which remains on the hive floor and can be picked up on the furry legs of other bees and ingested orally<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ribi\u00e8re|first=M.|last2=Lallemand|first2=P.|last3=Iscache|first3=A.-L.|last4=Schurr|first4=F.|last5=Celle|first5=O.|last6=Blanchard|first6=P.|last7=Olivier|first7=V.|last8=Faucon|first8=J.-P.|date=2007-12-01|title=Spread of Infectious Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus by Honeybee (Apis mellifera L.)

The second mechanism is through close contact between bees in the hive. [[Worker bee|Worker bees]] are the most susceptible to infection, since they travel the hive most frequently. The infection may spread between hives as a result of indirect contact or direct contact between honey bees<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ribiere|first1=M.|last2=Lallemand|first2=P.|last3=Iscache|first3=A.-L.|last4=Schurr|first4=F.|last5=Celle|first5=O.|last6=Blanchard|first6=P.|last7=Olivier|first7=V.|last8=Faucon|first8=J.-P.|date=12 October 2007|title=Spread of infections chronic bee paralysis virus by honeybee (''Apis mellifera'' L.) feces|journal=[[Applied and Environmental Microbiology]]|volume=73|issue=23|pages=7711\u20137716|doi=10.1128/AEM.01053-07|pmc=2168079|pmid=17933946}}</ref>. [[Research]] shows that mainly adult honey bees can be infected with chronic bee paralysis virus by a topical contact with infected feces or by ingestion of [[Virus|virion]]-containing substances<ref name=\"ribiere magali\" />.\n\n=== Viral replication cycle ===\n\n==== Entry into cell ====\nChronic bee paralysis virus is transmitted to honey bees through a [[Omnipresence|ubiquitous]] [[Parasitism|parasite]] common to honey bee hives, Varroa mites (''[[Varroa jacobsoni]]''). Varroa mites are known to harbor many viruses for which honey bees are susceptible and permissive<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.honeybeesuite.com/chronic-bee-paralysis-virus/|title=Chronic bee paralysis virus|date=2010-08-18|website=Honey Bee Suite|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>.The parasitic mites attach themselves to honey bees externally and feed off of the [[hemolymph]] of their hosts<ref name=\":2\" />. This exchange of fluids between the parasitic mites and the hosts allows for CBPV particles to enter fluid transfer systems in the honey bee body. The mechanisms by which chronic bee paralysis virus gains entry into honey bee cells is currently unknown.\n\n==== Replication ====\nLike other [[(+)ssRNA|positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses]], Chronic bee paralysis virus replicates in the [[cytoplasm]] of honeybee cells. The first large (+) RNA fragment in the CBPV [[genome]] likely encodes for an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]], which makes many copies of viral RNA. After many copies of the genome have been produced, the honey bee host's cellular processes will translate the viral RNA into functional [[Protein|proteins]] which can cause propagation of the virus inside the host. The virus replicates at the highest levels in the head of the honeybee, reaching an average of 10<sup>7</sup> copies of the virus in an infected worker bee head and as many as 10<sup>11</sup> copies of the virus in an infected [[queen bee]] head. Chronic bee paralysis virus particles have been found to concentrate in two centers; in [[mushroom bodies]] which play a role in sensory processing, [[memory]], and learning as well as in the central body, which plays a vital role in coordinating movement. Loss of flying ability in honey bees as a result of CBPV infection can be attributed to neuron destruction in the central body. Erratic behavior in infected bees may be a result of mushroom body neuron destruction. \n\n==== Symptoms ====\nInfected honeybees will begin to show symptoms of the illness within five days of infection, and the infection presents in two distinct ways, with Type I infection being the more common of the two infection types. \n\nA Type I infected bee presents with a bloated abdomen due to a fluid-filled honey sac and weak or trembling wings. Type I infected honey bees tend to crawl on the ground or cluster near the entrance of the hive, as their weakened wings lead to an inability to fly.\n\nA Type II infected honey bee presents with complete abdominal hair loss, causing it to appear black and greasy. These bees are still able to fly 2-3 days after symptoms begin to appear, but they lose their ability to fly shortly before succumbing to the disease.\n\nA third type of infection that is a major contributor to the spread of the virus is an infection of CBPV in which the infected bee exhibits no symptoms of the illness. The infected bee does not present with any of the classic symptoms of the disease before death, and, as a result, is able to transmit the virus beyond its own hive.\n\n==== Treatment ====\nThere is no known treatment for the disease currently. Often, infections of chronic bee paralysis virus die out on their own, but infected bees, if detected, must be removed from the hive immediately to lessen the chances of the virus spreading. Supplementing a smaller hive that has been severely affected by the virus with healthy bees from another colony can prevent colony collapse in struggling hives. The infection commonly surges in the winters rather than warmer months, for unknown reasons<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nTreating the hive against Varroa mites has also proven to be an effective preventive method against viral infection<ref name=\":2\" />. While bees should not be medicated against mites as a preventative measure because mites are quick to develop resistance; however, once detected, mites can be eliminated with the use of [[pesticides]]. Common pesticides include [[Apistan]], [[Formic acid|Formic Acid]], [[Thymol|Apiguard]]<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dummies.com/home-garden/hobby-farming/beekeeping/how-to-control-a-varroa-mite-problem-in-your-beehive/|title=How to Control a Varroa Mite Problem in Your Beehive|website=dummies|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>. Home remedies for exterminating mites in a bee hive also include dusting the hive floors as well as the honey bees themselves with powdered sugar in order to suffocate the mites<ref name=\":3\" />. \n\n== Testing ==\nChronic bee paralysis virus is classified as an [[Subclinical infection|inapparent infection]] because there are few tell-tale symptoms that appear before the infection has progressed to a fatal degree. As many honey bees can become infected and either show symptoms days after the initial point of infection or fail to show any symptoms throughout the entire course of the illness, CBPV can infect entire hives before the virus is detected. Despite the use of [[infectivity]] and [[Serology|serological tests]], these testing methods are often inaccurate and difficult to reproduce with consistent results.<ref name=\"ribiere magali\" />\n\n== Symbiotic relationships ==\nAlthough Chronic bee paralysis virus mainly infects honey bees, the virus has also been found to replicate in two species of [[carnivore|carnivorous]] [[ant]], ''[[Camponotus vagus]]'' and ''[[Formica rufa]]''.These carnivorous ants become infected with CBPV through two mechanisms: eating decomposing bees who harbor the virus or by independently collecting infected honeydew.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=Celle|first1=Olivier|last2=Blanchard|first2=Philippe|last3=Olivier|first3=Violaine|last4=Schurr|first4=Frank|last5=Cougoule|first5=Nicolas|last6=Faucon|first6=Jean-Paul|last7=Ribi\u00e8re|first7=Magali|date=May 2008|title=Detection of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) genome and its replicative RNA form in various hosts and possible ways of spread|url=https://hal-anses.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00414769/file/Detection_of_Chronic_bee_paralysis_virus_in_various_hosts_version_HAL_210909.pdf|journal=Virus Research|volume=133|issue=2|pages=280\u2013284|doi=10.1016/j.virusres.2007.12.011|pmid=18243390}}</ref>  While the virus does not cause any symptoms in the carnivorous ants, the [[Commensalism|commensal relationship]] between the virus and the ants allows the ants to serve as a reservoir for viral replication to occur<ref name=\":5\" />. \n\nChronic bee paralysis virus is also similar to [[slow bee paralysis virus]] and [[acute bee paralysis virus]]. Though CBPV does not fall into the same family as the other two viruses, it bears similarities to the other viruses because it causes paralysis as the fatal symptom of the infection. Slow bee paralysis, in contrast to Chronic bee paralysis virus, causes paralysis of the front two pairs of legs on honey bees ([[Apis mellifera cypria|''Apis mellifera'']]), silkworms ([[Bombyx mori|''Bombyx mori'']]'')'', and bumble bees ([[Bombus sylvarum|''Bombis spp.'']]'')''. This paralysis eventually causes death in the infected insects. Slow bee paralysis virus is transmitted to hives through ''[[Varroa destructor]]'' mite infestations. Because of the similarities between the two viruses, Chronic bee paralysis virus is suspected to have the same mode of transmission.\n\nChronic bee paralysis virus is also seen to interact with satellite viruses. The three short RNA segments of the viral genome are thought to be a satellite virus<ref name=\":4\" />. Only in the presence of CBPV can the associated satellite virus proliferate.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q16662559}}\n\n[[Category:Bee diseases]]\n[[Category:Insect viral diseases]]\n[[Category:Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses]]\n[[Category:Beekeeping]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_bee_paralysis_virus"}

The southeastern pocket of Co. Galway around Kinvara is usually included, and is the base for many Burren organisations. \nThe Burren is certainly bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and by [[Galway Bay]], with the [[Aran Islands]] representing a geological extension of the limestone hills that make up most of The Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\">{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=George|title=Exploring the Burren|publisher=Town House and Country House, Dublin|year=1998|isbn=0-946172-59-5|page=}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nAccording to one definition, the Burren extends south to a line from the coastal resort of [[Lahinch]] to Corofin and is delimited in the east by a line roughly from Kinvara to [[Kilmacduagh monastery]], near [[Gort]]. Note that taken literally, this would includes places like the town of [[Ennistymon]] and the [[Cliffs of Moher]], which would more commonly be considered as neighbouring the Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|5}}  In another definition, the \"Burren Programme\" defines the region as extending well into the Gort plain, encompassing inter alia [[Coole Park]] and the [[Turlough (lake)|turloughs]] around it, while to the south it would extend to [[Ruan, County Clare|Ruan]] and [[Crusheen]], and in the southwest to the edge of [[Doolin]], as well as the routine Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and Corofin.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nThus the stated size of the Burren varies between around {{convert|250|km2|mi2}} (the core area of exposed limestone), through {{convert|360|km2|mi2}} (taking in all limestone landscapes) and 560 square kilometers (including the about {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} of downland), depending on the approach taken.

All of the solid rocks exposed at the surface are of [[Carboniferous]] age though they are underlain at depth by [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[Devonian]] age which in turn overlies rocks of Lower [[Palaeozoic]] age. None of the pre-Carboniferous rocks is seen at the surface in the area.<ref name=\"auto\">Landscape and Rocks of the Burren: a guide to the geology of the area. Geological Survey of Ireland 2008</ref> The limestones, which date from the [[Visean]] stage of the early Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 325 million years ago. The strata contain fossil [[coral]]s, [[crinoid]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[ammonites]]. This bed of limestone is up to 800 metres thick. In the north and west it lies on a shelf of Galway granite which supported the upper layers, preventing shifts like those that created the \"twisted\" hills Knockanes and Mullaghmore. The limestone also extends below Galway Bay out to the Aran Islands and to the east into the Gort plain.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|16,33}}\n\nLater in the Carboniferous (c. 318 million years ago), the limestone was covered by darker sand and mud that later turned into [[shale]] (the lower \"Clare Shales\") and [[sandstone]] (the upper \"Millstone Grit\"). These layers reached a thickness of up to {{convert|330|m|ft}} in north Clare. These top layers protected the underlying limestone from erosion for millions of years before being largely stripped away by glaciers, except in the south west, where they still extend from Doolin to Slieve Elva, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and to the western shore of Lake Inchiquin. One \"island\" of shale is the hill Poulacapple, southwest of Ballyvaughan, where an upland moor has formed on top of the impermeable shale layers.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|16,33}}<ref name=\"Feehan1\">\n{{Citation | last =Feehan | first =John | contribution =The Rocks and Landforms of the Burren | year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =14-23|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}</ref>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe local geological succession comprises the following [[geological formation|formations]] some of which are subdivided into various [[Stratigraphic_unit#Lithostratigraphic_units|members]].

Glaciers expanded and retreated over the region several times. Of the last two periods the first was the more pronounced, covering the whole of the Burren. The last advance of the ice cover was more limited, affecting only the eastern Burren.<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|20-1}}\n\nThe result is that The Burren is one of the finest examples of [[glaciokarst|glacio-karst]] landscape in the world. The effects of the [[last glacial period]] (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with The Burren overrun by ice during this glaciation.<ref name=\"BurrenNP_Geol\"/> The impact of earlier [[karstification]] (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any surface karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and The Burren karst is thus very recent in geological terms. \n\nSolutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the [[limestone pavement]]. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. This has formed numerous cave systems of which more than 50 kilometers have been mapped.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}} The most accessible of these is [[Aillwee Cave]].\n\nDue to the processes mentioned, there are very few permanent surface rivers in the region. The Caher, flowing into the sea at [[Fanore]], is one of the most stable.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}} Some of the large valleys, mostly running south to north, that are still visible today are in fact the remains of pre-glacial river valleys. The rivers disappeared from the surface when the upper layers of stone had been stripped away. \n\nAnother characteristic features of The Burren are closed roughly circular depressions with no surface outlets for water (called [[polje]]). Around 100 of these exist, mostly present in the eastern Burren. The most notable are the valleys of Kilcorney, Poulawilan, Caherconnel and Carran, generally stretching from northeast to southwest. The largest is the Carran depression, more than two miles long, up to a mile wide and over 200 feet deep. This is where the pre-glacial rivers of the area first eroded away the upper layers and started to dissolve the exposed limestone. Some of the smaller ones were created when caves underneath collapsed (one example of this is the Glen of Clab).<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|19-20}}\n\nGlaciers also deposited numerous granite and limestone [[Glacial erratic|erratics]] on the pavements. The former were carried south across Galway Bay by the second-to-last glaciation. Granite boulders can be found mostly in the north of the Burren. The final ice cover came from the northeast and mostly deposited limestone erratics. On Slieve Elva these are visible today at elevations of up to {{convert|300|m|ft}} mabove sea level. The characteristic terracing of the hills occurred when vertical joints weathered and large blocks of limestone fell off and were further eroded away.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}}<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|16,21}}\n\nTowards the very end of the Ice Age the glaciers ended for a time at Fanore. At that time, Slieve Elva and Knockauns hill alone rose above the surrounding ice fields. The valleys facing Galway Bay had been widened considerably by glacial action, first when the ice moved south from Connemara and then when meltwater sought a runoff. When the ice finally retreated it also left moraines in valley bottoms and the characteristic [[drumlin]]s (most of them on top of the shale and sandstone to the south). The Caher Valley was almost choked up by deposited sand and rocks and these also piled up against the western slopes of Slieve Elva.

No clear evidence of Mesolithic settlements or camp sites in the area has yet been discovered. At the limits of the region, near [[Lake Inchiquin]] and at the so-called \"Doolin Axe Factory\", stone artifacts have been discovered that may be Mesolithic in origin. However, by the [[Neolithic]], c. 4000 BC, settlers had clearly arrived and began changing the landscape through deforestation, likely by overgrazing and burning, and the building of stone walls. These people also constructed Megalithic sites like the portal tomb known as [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] and the [[Court cairn|court tombs]] at Teergonean (near Doolin) and Ballyganner (near [[Noughaval]]). Overall, there are around 70 megalithic tombs in the Burren area, more than half of all of these structures found in Clare.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|7-8}}<ref name=\"Arch\">{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}</ref>{{rp|5}}<ref name=\"Waddell\">{{Citation | last =Waddell| first =John | contribution =The First People - the Prehistoric Burren| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =59-76|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n\nThe most numerous type of prehistoric structure (apart from stone walls) in The Burren is the late-Neolithic/early-[[Bronze Age]] [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]], mostly dated to the period 2500 to 2000 BC. It accounts for around 90% of the region's megalithic tombs. Many examples of these are found on Roughan Hill near [[Kilnaboy]], including those at [[Parknabinnia (wedge tomb)|Parknabinnia]] and [[Creevagh (wedge tomb)|Creevagh]]. Others are located at [[Gleninsheen (wedge tomb)|Gleninsheen]] and Berneens (Rathborney) and Poulaphuca (Carran). Large stone cairns on many hills, such as the [[Poulawack Cairn]], also date from this period.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"Waddell\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nThe economy at that time was likely based on pastoral farming in fairly small groups. As is still done today, the cattle were moved in a reverse of the usual seasonal pattern: cattle are moved to the uplands in the winter, allowing year round grazing.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nEvidence of [[Beaker culture|Beaker pottery]] was found on Roughan Hill, but in general few signs of the actual settlements of the Neolithic people have been found. This may be due to the fact that their structures were lightly built (from wood or other non-permanent materials).<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|11}} \n\nDuring the Bronze Age, locals also built many ''[[Fulacht fiadh|Fulachtai fiadh]]'', remains of more than 300 survive in the region. Their exact function is still debated, but they probably served as places where water was heated by fire, either for cooking, brewing or bathing purposes.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nHowever, in contrast to the quantity of archaeological evidence found, the population of The Burren likely declined noticeably between the late Neolithic and the end of the Bronze Age. This was likely largely due to a shift in the climate, possibly related to the volcanic eruption known as \"[[Hekla 4]]\". Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC temperatures dropped and the climate became wetter. Heavy rainfall combined with previous clearing activity to cause serious soil erosion in the uplands. Evidence suggests that much of the soil cover over the limestone karst was in fact removed during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. This reduction in the area of fertile land put pressure on population numbers and probably increased conflicts over scarce resources. Building of new stone walls largely came to an end \u2013 there is a gap in documented building between the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and early Christian periods. By the end of the Bronze Age, the uplands were largely depopulated.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nNevertheless, like the [[Mooghaun North Hoard]] found near Newmarket-on-Fergus, the discovery of a golden Bronze Age gorget in [[Rathborney|Gleninsheen townland]] indicates the (at least temporary) local presence of a late Bronze Age society that was rich, mobile and well-connected via trade networks with other regions.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|13}} \n\nLike in many places of Ireland, datable [[Iron Age]] sites are rare in The Burren. This may be due to the use of dwellings that did not leave durable traces (wooden buildings or even tents). Some of the extant [[ringfort|r\u00e1ths, cashels or cahers]] may actually have Iron Age origins. However, few have been excavated and those that have been the subject of research, like [[Cahercommaun]], [[Caherconnell Stone Fort|Caherconnel]], [[Cahermore ringfort|Cahermore]] or [[Ballyallaban ringfort|Ballyallaban]], are thought to be early Medieval or later in origin. The large enigmatic enclosure of Turlough Hill (see [[Oughtmama]]) may be Iron Age or earlier. Definite regional findings from this era are limited to a few bronze horse bridles discovered near Corofin and at Ballyalla ([[Kilshanny]]).<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Ucht M\u00e1ma Middle and West Churches NW 2015 09 02.jpg|thumb|Early Christian churches at Oughtmama]]\n[[File:Corecomroe Abbey Ruhende Statue.jpg|thumb|Tomb in the sanctuary of Corcomroe Abbey with effigy of Conor O'Brien, King of Thomond]]\n\nIn the Iron Age and early Medieval times, the region was controlled by a family or tribe known as the ''Corco Modhruadh'', meaning \"seed\" or \"people of Modhruadh\". They were one of dozens of minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (''tuath'') and were joined by a common bloodline or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Gosling\"/>{{rp|78}}\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the region appears to have been ruled from the [[Aran Islands]] by the ''E\u00f3ganacht \u00c1rann'', a minor branch of the [[E\u00f3ganachta|E\u00f3ganacht dynasty of Munster]].<ref name=\"Gosling\">{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Early Historic Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =77-91|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}</ref>{{rp|78}}\n\nThe history of these years is uncertain, but after the decline of the ''E\u00f3ganacht \u00c1rann'' the local ''Corco Modhruadh'' likely fell under the control of the ''[[U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidhne]]'', a tribe from what is now southern Galway, who prospered in the 7th century. The local tribes were then probably subjects of the ''[[E\u00f3ganacht Locha L\u00e9in]]'' until their influence declined in the early 9th century. Whether the ''Corco Modhruadh'' still existed as a distinct group at that point is uncertain, as they and their neighbours ''[[Corcu Baiscind]]'' may have been assimilated into or conquered by the ''[[D\u00e9isi|D\u00e9isi Tuisceart]]'' of eastern Clare, who won a major battle against the ''Corco Modhruadh'' in 744. By the 9th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh'' had been driven into the Burren uplands.<ref name=\"Gosling\"/>{{rp|78}} \n\nThe Burren area is notable for the presence of several potential or likely \"early\" (i.e. pre-12th-century) ecclesiastical or monastic sites. These include Kilfenora, Kilnaboy, [[Temple Cronan]] and the churches of Oughtmama. A broader definition of The Burren would also include [[Dysert O'Dea Monastery]] near Corofin and Kilmacduagh. The large number of extant cashels, almost 500 of which have been identified in The Burren (out of around 45,000 in Ireland), also indicates the presence of a sizeable (early) medieval population that supported and used these churches.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11}}<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nAt the end of the first millennium, the ''[[D\u00e1l gCais]]'' expanded into the region, against the resistance of the incumbent [[U\u00ed Lochlainn]] and [[O'Conor]] families. The later regionally dominant [[O'Brien dynasty]] traced its origins to them. Evidence of Viking activity in the region is scant. They settled at Limerick, but in the Burren only a few artifacts of Scandinavian design have been found, centred mostly on Cahercommaun, which apparently was a major producer of wool at the time. A Viking arrowhead was found at the ringfort and a Viking hollow-bead necklace (likely dating from 820 to 850 AD) was discovered in nearby Glencurran Cave.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|21-4}}\n\nEither at the end of the 12th or early in the 13th century, [[Cistercian]] monks came to the area and established ''Sancta Maria de Petra Fertili'', now known as [[Corcomroe Abbey]].<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nIn the 12th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh''/Corcomroe territory was made into the newly created [[Diocese of Kilfenora]], of 13 parishes, and the church at Kilfenora became a cathedral.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9-10}} \n\nAt some point around the 12th century, the territory of \"Corcomroe\" was divided in two for administrative purposes: ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' (\"Western Corcomroe\") and ''Corco Modhruadh Oirthearach'' (\"Eastern Corcomroe\"), also known as ''Boireann'' which in the late 16th century became the English administrative Baronies of [[Corcomroe (barony)|Corcomroe]] and [[Burren (barony)|Burren]], respectively.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe end of the Medieval period was a difficult era for people in the area. Like much of Europe, the region suffered from the [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Great Famine]] (1315-7) and the [[Black Death]]. In addition, infighting between the Gaelic lords contributed to a socio-economic decline of the region. This was also reflected in a regional hiatus in large construction projects during the 13th and most of the 14th century.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|30}}\n\n===Early Modern===\nFor a long-time the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman incursions into Ireland]] had little direct impact on the region. As late as at the [[Battle of Dysert O'Dea]] in 1318 some of the local clans allied to defeat a Norman army led by [[Richard de Clare, Steward of Forest of Essex|Richard de Clare]]. The people and their rulers thus continued to live in fortified houses, often inside the cashels, mostly retaining their [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic culture]]. One example of this are the [[Early Irish law|Brehon]] law schools of the O'Davorans at [[Cahermacnaghten]] or the MacClancys at Doolin.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11-4}}\n\nOnly in the 15th and 16th centuries did the [[tower houses]] as exemplified today by places like [[Newtown Castle]], [[Shanmuckinish Castle]], [[Doonagore Castle]] or [[Ballinalacken Castle]] become widespread. Norman-type castles, such as the one built at [[Quin Abbey|Quin]], were absent in the Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11-4}} T.J. Westropp counted the remains of around 70 tower houses in the Baronies of Inchiquin, Corcomroe and Burren, with 21 of them located in the latter. Only around half of those 21 survive to any height in the 21st century. The distribution of the tower houses indicates that they were built close to the barony borders, which also represented the boundaries of the territories controlled by clans or families (see below). 11 of the 21 tower houses in the Barony of Burren lie within 1 km of its borders.<ref name=\"Gosling2\">{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Medieval Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =119-34|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}</ref>{{rp|127,129}}\n\nThe O'Loughlin (\u00d3 Lochlainn) clan ruled ''Boireann'' down to the mid-17th century from their chief residence at [[Gregans Castle]] (the tower house, not the house of the same name). The chief of the family was known in later times as the 'Prince of Burren' and clan members were buried in the family tomb near the altar of Corcomroe Abbey. Their kinsmen, the O'Conor (\u00d3 Conchubhair), clan ruled ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' from [[Dough Castle]] near [[Liscannor]]. The villages and towns found within the medieval territory of Boireann include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay (Newquay) / Burrin (Burren), [[Noughaval]], Bealaclugga (Bellharbour), [[Carran|Carron]] and Fanore / Craggagh.\n\nBoth clans were eventually subjects of the O'Briens, the rulers of [[Thomond]]. Especially in the southwest, the O'Briens sometimes extended their direct influence, taking over houses and territories for themselves. They controlled the castles at [[Dromoland Castle|Dromoland]] and [[Leamaneh Castle|Leamaneh]] and later became the [[Baron Inchiquin|Barons Inchiquin]].<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\n==Culture==\nThe Burren has a long history of traditional Irish music. It is particularly known for the \"West Clare Style\" of [[concertina]] playing, and music festivals in [[Doolin]] and [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]].  The area also has a long history as a source of artistic inspiration, and has hosted a number of art galleries.\n\nThe Burren has inspired many non-fiction books, often accompanied by extensive illustration of the landscape.  A series of [[detective fiction]] novels, written by Cora Harrison, features the Burren's [[brehon]] judge (fictional) in the early 1500s, when the area still existed as a distinct Gaelic administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|title=Severn House|website=severnhouse.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122235021/http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|archivedate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Economic activity==\nThe leading economic activities in the Burren are agriculture and tourism.\n\n===Tourism===\nThe Burren has a reputation beyond Ireland, and, most notably with the Cliffs of Moher, but also with the major [[show caves]], [[dolmens]] such as at [[Poulnabrone]] and other prehistoric sites, and centres of cultural activity, attracts tourists from a wide range of countries.  There are a range of hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast facilities, and other accommodation providers.\n\nTourism presents some challenges in such an environmentally sensitive area, as it creates mostly seasonal employment, results in a large share of local houses being used only in the summer, and puts additional strain on environmental resources, thus exacerbating the effect of a significant increase in the number of houses in some areas during the 1990s and 2000s.  This has been a thread in the development and preservation activities previously discussed, and has driven the growth of local ecotourism, and the \"Leave No Trace\" local campaigns.  Concerns have also arisen about the level of day-tourism, especially by coaches, as opposed to overnight-staying tourists, who generate significantly more revenue.\n\n====Ecotourism in the Burren====\n[[Ecotourism]] is an important factor in The Burren, with many organisations involved, including the Burren Ecotourism Network. A key goal is to deal with the challenge of protecting the vulnerable landscape, while at the same time having it provide a fair income for the local inhabitants and allowing it to cope with increased visitor numbers. [[Sustainability|Sustainable]] ecotourism and independent \"'Ecotourism Certification\" for companies are intended to deal with those conflicting demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|title=Burren EcoTourism {{!}} The Burren Centre|website=www.theburrencentre.ie|access-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015209/http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|archivedate=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Gastro-tourism====\nA Burren Food Trail was launched in 2013, and has more than 20 members offering hospitality, and / or food and drink products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|title=Burren Food Trail - Visit the Burren|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028220623/http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|archivedate=2017-10-28}}</ref> The trail won the Irish prize in the European Destination of Excellence - Tourism and Local Gastronomy competition in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|title=Failte Ireland - The Burren Food Trail is Cream of the Crop|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129140453/http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|archivedate=2018-01-29}}</ref> In association with the food trail events such as a Slow Food festival and a Food Fayre are organised.

Arable farming is limited, and the main animals kept are cattle and goats.\n\nAs summarized by local landscape organisation, the Burrenbeo Trust<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/our-work-with-others/burren-beo-trust|title=Burren Beo Trust|website=Heritagecouncil.ie|}}</ref>, the traditional local system of cattle husbandry \"involves exploiting the unusual attributes afforded by the region's limestone geology. Up until quite recently, hardy native breeds of beef cattle were used to graze upland grasslands between the months of October and April, requiring scarcely any dietary supplement prior to their removal to finishing grass elsewhere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|title=Farming in the Burren|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122181644/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|archivedate=2018-01-22}}</ref> Thus the agricultural methods used but also protected the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|title=Agriculture - Burrenbeo Trust|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070640/https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|archivedate=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\n====Challenges====\nSince the 20th century the spread of intensive farming techniques (including sometimes heavy use of nitrate fertilisers) along with the possibilities offered by heavy equipment to transform limestone pavement into pasture has posed new challenges for the ecosystem and its diversity. Research conducted in the 1990s suggests that by the end of that decade the area of limestone pavement had halved since pre-Famine times, c. 1840, while from the 1970s to the 1990s alone, about 4% of pavements were converted into pasture or covered by roads. \n\nDespite the intensification of agriculture on the uplands{{cn|date=January 2018}}, population numbers fell from around 4,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to roughly 2,500 by the time of the 1991 Census, before rising once more.

These colonised more of the limestone area as a result of reduced grazing by cattle and goats. The increasing industrialization of agriculture and the introduction of different breeds of cattle led to shifts in cattle-raising practices \u2013 away from winter grazing, which kept down new growth, and towards supplementary feeding.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In addition, in the past saplings were often pulled from fields by hand to maintain grazing areas. Trees also used to be harvested for firewood, hazel rods were used for thatching as well as for fence- and basket-making. As these practices ceased, the brush advanced. This notably reduces biodiversity in the affected areas.<ref name=\"Dunford\"/>{{rp|236-8}}\n\n====BurrenLIFE====\nIn response to under-grazing, loss of husbandry and land management traditions, and abandonment and consolidation of farms, the BurrenLIFE program, coordinated by the geopark, launched a new sustainable farming initiative.  This began with twenty farms, representative of the diversity of local agriculture, for each of which a specific plan of costed actions was devised.  After refinement, the initiative was extended to 320 farmers over two phases, and another 130 are expected to join a final phase.  Typical recommendations enacted included scrub clearance, restoration of drystone walls, reduction in silage usage and a return to winter grazing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|title=A new project is saving the unique landscape of the Burren|first=Hayley|last=Halpin|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122056/http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|archivedate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Balancing needs===\nFor the past decades, the government and private groups have attempted to square the demands of local farmers, tourists and the environment.

The southeastern pocket of Co. Galway around Kinvara is usually included, and is the base for many Burren organisations. \nThe Burren is certainly bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and by [[Galway Bay]], with the [[Aran Islands]] representing a geological extension of the limestone hills that make up most of The Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\">{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=George|title=Exploring the Burren|publisher=Town House and Country House, Dublin|year=1998|isbn=0-946172-59-5|page=}}</ref>{{rp|5}}\n\nAccording to one definition, the Burren extends south to a line from the coastal resort of [[Lahinch]] to Corofin and is delimited in the east by a line roughly from Kinvara to [[Kilmacduagh monastery]], near [[Gort]]. Note that taken literally, this would includes places like the town of [[Ennistymon]] and the [[Cliffs of Moher]], which would more commonly be considered as neighbouring the Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|5}}  In another definition, the \"Burren Programme\" defines the region as extending well into the Gort plain, encompassing inter alia [[Coole Park]] and the [[Turlough (lake)|turloughs]] around it, while to the south it would extend to [[Ruan, County Clare|Ruan]] and [[Crusheen]], and in the southwest to the edge of [[Doolin]], as well as the routine Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and Corofin.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nThus the stated size of the Burren varies between around {{convert|250|km2|mi2}} (the core area of exposed limestone), through {{convert|360|km2|mi2}} (taking in all limestone landscapes) and 560 square kilometers (including the about {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} of downland), depending on the approach taken.

All of the solid rocks exposed at the surface are of [[Carboniferous]] age though they are underlain at depth by [[Old Red Sandstone]] of [[Devonian]] age which in turn overlies rocks of Lower [[Palaeozoic]] age. None of the pre-Carboniferous rocks is seen at the surface in the area.<ref name=\"auto\">Landscape and Rocks of the Burren: a guide to the geology of the area. Geological Survey of Ireland 2008</ref> The limestones, which date from the [[Visean]] stage of the early Carboniferous, formed as sediments in a tropical sea approximately 325 million years ago. The strata contain fossil [[coral]]s, [[crinoid]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[ammonites]]. This bed of limestone is up to 800 metres thick. In the north and west it lies on a shelf of Galway granite which supported the upper layers, preventing shifts like those that created the \"twisted\" hills Knockanes and Mullaghmore. The limestone also extends below Galway Bay out to the Aran Islands and to the east into the Gort plain.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|16,33}}\n\nLater in the Carboniferous (c. 318 million years ago), the limestone was covered by darker sand and mud that later turned into [[shale]] (the lower \"Clare Shales\") and [[sandstone]] (the upper \"Millstone Grit\"). These layers reached a thickness of up to {{convert|330|m|ft}} in north Clare. These top layers protected the underlying limestone from erosion for millions of years before being largely stripped away by glaciers, except in the south west, where they still extend from Doolin to Slieve Elva, Lisdoonvarna, Kilfenora and to the western shore of Lake Inchiquin. One \"island\" of shale is the hill Poulacapple, southwest of Ballyvaughan, where an upland moor has formed on top of the impermeable shale layers.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|16,33}}<ref name=\"Feehan1\">\n{{Citation | last =Feehan | first =John | contribution =The Rocks and Landforms of the Burren | year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =14-23|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}</ref>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe local geological succession comprises the following [[geological formation|formations]] some of which are subdivided into various [[Stratigraphic_unit#Lithostratigraphic_units|members]]. The youngest rocks are at the start of the list, the oldest at the bottom.

Glaciers expanded and retreated over the region several times. Of the last two periods the first was the more pronounced, covering the whole of the Burren. The last advance of the ice cover was more limited, affecting only the eastern Burren.<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|20-1}}\n\nThe result is that The Burren is one of the finest examples of [[glaciokarst|glacio-karst]] landscape in the world. The effects of the [[last glacial period]] (the Midlandian) are most in evidence, with The Burren overrun by ice during this glaciation.<ref name=\"BurrenNP_Geol\"/> The impact of earlier [[karstification]] (solutional erosion) has been eliminated by the last glacial period. So any surface karstification now seen dates from approximately 10,000 years ago and The Burren karst is thus very recent in geological terms. \n\nSolutional processes have widened and deepened the grikes of the [[limestone pavement]]. Pre-existing lines of weakness in the rock (vertical joints) contribute to the formation of extensive fissures separated by clints (flat pavement like slabs). The rock karstification facilitates the formation of subterranean drainage. This has formed numerous cave systems of which more than 50 kilometers have been mapped.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}} The most accessible of these is [[Aillwee Cave]].\n\nDue to the processes mentioned, there are very few permanent surface rivers in the region. The Caher, flowing into the sea at [[Fanore]], is one of the most stable.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}} Some of the large valleys, mostly running south to north, that are still visible today are in fact the remains of pre-glacial river valleys. The rivers disappeared from the surface when the upper layers of stone had been stripped away. \n\nAnother characteristic features of The Burren are closed roughly circular depressions with no surface outlets for water (called [[polje]]). Around 100 of these exist, mostly present in the eastern Burren. The most notable are the valleys of Kilcorney, Poulawilan, Caherconnel and Carran, generally stretching from northeast to southwest. The largest is the Carran depression, more than two miles long, up to a mile wide and over 200 feet deep. This is where the pre-glacial rivers of the area first eroded away the upper layers and started to dissolve the exposed limestone. Some of the smaller ones were created when caves underneath collapsed (one example of this is the Glen of Clab).<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|19-20}}\n\nGlaciers also deposited numerous granite and limestone [[Glacial erratic|erratics]] on the pavements. The former were carried south across Galway Bay by the second-to-last glaciation. Granite boulders can be found mostly in the north of the Burren. The final ice cover came from the northeast and mostly deposited limestone erratics. On Slieve Elva these are visible today at elevations of up to {{convert|300|m|ft}} mabove sea level. The characteristic terracing of the hills occurred when vertical joints weathered and large blocks of limestone fell off and were further eroded away.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|33}}<ref name=\"Feehan1\"/>{{rp|16,21}}\n\nTowards the very end of the Ice Age the glaciers ended for a time at Fanore. At that time, Slieve Elva and Knockauns hill alone rose above the surrounding ice fields. The valleys facing Galway Bay had been widened considerably by glacial action, first when the ice moved south from Connemara and then when meltwater sought a runoff. When the ice finally retreated it also left moraines in valley bottoms and the characteristic [[drumlin]]s (most of them on top of the shale and sandstone to the south). The Caher Valley was almost choked up by deposited sand and rocks and these also piled up against the western slopes of Slieve Elva.

No clear evidence of Mesolithic settlements or camp sites in the area has yet been discovered. At the limits of the region, near [[Lake Inchiquin]] and at the so-called \"Doolin Axe Factory\", stone artifacts have been discovered that may be Mesolithic in origin. However, by the [[Neolithic]], c. 4000 BC, settlers had clearly arrived and began changing the landscape through deforestation, likely by overgrazing and burning, and the building of stone walls. These people also constructed Megalithic sites like the portal tomb known as [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] and the [[Court cairn|court tombs]] at Teergonean (near Doolin) and Ballyganner (near [[Noughaval]]). Overall, there are around 70 megalithic tombs in the Burren area, more than half of all of these structures found in Clare.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|7-8}}<ref name=\"Arch\">{{cite book|last=Carthy|first=Hugh|title=Burren Archaeology|publisher=The Collins Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848891050|page=}}</ref>{{rp|5}}<ref name=\"Waddell\">{{Citation | last =Waddell| first =John | contribution =The First People - the Prehistoric Burren| year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell |editor-first1 =J.W. |editor-last2 =Korff | editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =59-76|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas | id = }}</ref>{{rp|60}}\n\nThe most numerous type of prehistoric structure (apart from stone walls) in The Burren is the late-Neolithic/early-[[Bronze Age]] [[Wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]], mostly dated to the period 2500 to 2000 BC. It accounts for around 90% of the region's megalithic tombs. Many examples of these are found on Roughan Hill near [[Kilnaboy]], including those at [[Parknabinnia (wedge tomb)|Parknabinnia]] and [[Creevagh (wedge tomb)|Creevagh]]. Others are located at [[Gleninsheen (wedge tomb)|Gleninsheen]] and Berneens (Rathborney) and Poulaphuca (Carran). Large stone cairns on many hills, such as the [[Poulawack Cairn]], also date from this period.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}<ref name=\"Waddell\"/>{{rp|63}}\n\nThe economy at that time was likely based on pastoral farming in fairly small groups. As is still done today, the cattle were moved in a reverse of the usual seasonal pattern: cattle are moved to the uplands in the winter, allowing year round grazing.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nEvidence of [[Beaker culture|Beaker pottery]] was found on Roughan Hill, but in general few signs of the actual settlements of the Neolithic people have been found. This may be due to the fact that their structures were lightly built (from wood or other non-permanent materials).<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|11}} \n\nDuring the Bronze Age, locals also built many ''[[Fulacht fiadh|Fulachtai fiadh]]'', remains of more than 300 survive in the region. Their exact function is still debated, but they probably served as places where water was heated by fire, either for cooking, brewing or bathing purposes.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nHowever, in contrast to the quantity of archaeological evidence found, the population of The Burren likely declined noticeably between the late Neolithic and the end of the Bronze Age. This was likely largely due to a shift in the climate, possibly related to the volcanic eruption known as \"[[Hekla 4]]\". Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC temperatures dropped and the climate became wetter. Heavy rainfall combined with previous clearing activity to cause serious soil erosion in the uplands. Evidence suggests that much of the soil cover over the limestone karst was in fact removed during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. This reduction in the area of fertile land put pressure on population numbers and probably increased conflicts over scarce resources. Building of new stone walls largely came to an end \u2013 there is a gap in documented building between the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and early Christian periods. By the end of the Bronze Age, the uplands were largely depopulated.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nNevertheless, like the [[Mooghaun North Hoard]] found near Newmarket-on-Fergus, the discovery of a golden Bronze Age gorget in [[Rathborney|Gleninsheen townland]] indicates the (at least temporary) local presence of a late Bronze Age society that was rich, mobile and well-connected via trade networks with other regions.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|13}} \n\nLike in many places of Ireland, datable [[Iron Age]] sites are rare in The Burren. This may be due to the use of dwellings that did not leave durable traces (wooden buildings or even tents). Some of the extant [[ringfort|r\u00e1ths, cashels or cahers]] may actually have Iron Age origins. However, few have been excavated and those that have been the subject of research, like [[Cahercommaun]], [[Caherconnell Stone Fort|Caherconnel]], [[Cahermore ringfort|Cahermore]] or [[Ballyallaban ringfort|Ballyallaban]], are thought to be early Medieval or later in origin. The large enigmatic enclosure of Turlough Hill (see [[Oughtmama]]) may be Iron Age or earlier. Definite regional findings from this era are limited to a few bronze horse bridles discovered near Corofin and at Ballyalla ([[Kilshanny]]).<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|16}}\n\n===Medieval===\n[[File:Ucht M\u00e1ma Middle and West Churches NW 2015 09 02.jpg|thumb|Early Christian churches at Oughtmama]]\n[[File:Corecomroe Abbey Ruhende Statue.jpg|thumb|Tomb in the sanctuary of Corcomroe Abbey with effigy of Conor O'Brien, King of Thomond]]\n\nIn the Iron Age and early Medieval times, the region was controlled by a family or tribe known as the ''Corco Modhruadh'', meaning \"seed\" or \"people of Modhruadh\". They were one of dozens of minor tribes in Ireland at that time, which occupied a discrete area (''tuath'') and were joined by a common bloodline or origin myths. By the time Christianity arrived locally, their territory had shrunk somewhat, encompassing what later became the Baronies of Burren and Corcomroe as well as some parts of Inchiquin barony (see below).<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9}}<ref name=\"Gosling\"/>{{rp|78}}\n\nDuring the 5th and 6th centuries, the region appears to have been ruled from the Aran Islands by the ''E\u00f3ganacht \u00c1rann'', a minor branch of the [[E\u00f3ganachta|E\u00f3ganacht dynasty of Munster]].<ref name=\"Gosling\">{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Early Historic Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =77-91|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}</ref>{{rp|78}}\n\nThe history of these years is uncertain, but after the decline of the ''E\u00f3ganacht \u00c1rann'' the local ''Corco Modhruadh'' likely fell under the control of the ''[[U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidhne]]'', a tribe from what is now southern Galway, who prospered in the 7th century. The local tribes were then probably subjects of the ''[[E\u00f3ganacht Locha L\u00e9in]]'' until their influence declined in the early 9th century. Whether the ''Corco Modhruadh'' still existed as a distinct group at that point is uncertain, as they and their neighbours ''[[Corcu Baiscind]]'' may have been assimilated into or conquered by the ''[[D\u00e9isi|D\u00e9isi Tuisceart]]'' of eastern Clare, who won a major battle against the ''Corco Modhruadh'' in 744. By the 9th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh'' had been driven into the Burren uplands.<ref name=\"Gosling\"/>{{rp|78}} \n\nThe Burren area is notable for the presence of several potential or likely \"early\" (i.e. pre-12th-century) ecclesiastical or monastic sites. These include Kilfenora, Kilnaboy, [[Temple Cronan]] and the churches of Oughtmama. A broader definition of The Burren would also include [[Dysert O'Dea Monastery]] near Corofin and Kilmacduagh. The large number of extant cashels, almost 500 of which have been identified in The Burren (out of around 45,000 in Ireland), also indicates the presence of a sizeable (early) medieval population that supported and used these churches.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11}}<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nAt the end of the first millennium, the ''[[D\u00e1l gCais]]'' expanded into the region, against the resistance of the incumbent [[U\u00ed Lochlainn]] and [[O'Conor]] families. The later regionally dominant [[O'Brien dynasty]] traced its origins to them. Evidence of Viking activity in the region is scant. They settled at Limerick, but in the Burren only a few artifacts of Scandinavian design have been found, centred mostly on Cahercommaun, which apparently was a major producer of wool at the time. A Viking arrowhead was found at the ringfort and a Viking hollow-bead necklace (likely dating from 820 to 850 AD) was discovered in nearby Glencurran Cave.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|21-4}}\n\nEither at the end of the 12th or early in the 13th century, [[Cistercian]] monks came to the area and established ''Sancta Maria de Petra Fertili'', now known as [[Corcomroe Abbey]].<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nIn the 12th century, the ''Corco Modhruadh''/Corcomroe territory was made into the newly created [[Diocese of Kilfenora]], of 13 parishes, and the church at Kilfenora became a cathedral.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|9-10}} \n\nAt some point around the 12th century, the territory of \"Corcomroe\" was divided in two for administrative purposes: ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' (\"Western Corcomroe\") and ''Corco Modhruadh Oirthearach'' (\"Eastern Corcomroe\"), also known as ''Boireann'' which in the late 16th century became the English administrative Baronies of [[Corcomroe (barony)|Corcomroe]] and [[Burren (barony)|Burren]], respectively.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe end of the Medieval period was a difficult era for people in the area. Like much of Europe, the region suffered from the [[Great Famine of 1315\u201317|Great Famine]] (1315-7) and the [[Black Death]]. In addition, infighting between the Gaelic lords contributed to a socio-economic decline of the region. This was also reflected in a regional hiatus in large construction projects during the 13th and most of the 14th century.<ref name=\"Arch\"/>{{rp|30}}\n\n===Early Modern===\nFor a long-time the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Anglo-Norman incursions into Ireland]] had little direct impact on the region. As late as at the [[Battle of Dysert O'Dea]] in 1318 some of the local clans allied to defeat a Norman army led by [[Richard de Clare, Steward of Forest of Essex|Richard de Clare]]. The people and their rulers thus continued to live in fortified houses, often inside the cashels, mostly retaining their [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic culture]]. One example of this are the [[Early Irish law|Brehon]] law schools of the O'Davorans at [[Cahermacnaghten]] or the MacClancys at Doolin.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11-4}}\n\nOnly in the 15th and 16th centuries did the [[tower houses]] as exemplified today by places like [[Newtown Castle]], [[Shanmuckinish Castle]], [[Doonagore Castle]] or [[Ballinalacken Castle]] become widespread. Norman-type castles, such as the one built at [[Quin Abbey|Quin]], were absent in the Burren.<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|11-4}} T.J. Westropp counted the remains of around 70 tower houses in the Baronies of Inchiquin, Corcomroe and Burren, with 21 of them located in the latter. Only around half of those 21 survive to any height in the 21st century. The distribution of the tower houses indicates that they were built close to the barony borders, which also represented the boundaries of the territories controlled by clans or families (see below). 11 of the 21 tower houses in the Barony of Burren lie within 1 km of its borders.<ref name=\"Gosling2\">{{Citation|last =Gosling|first =Paul|contribution =The Burren in Medieval Times|year = 2001|title =The Book of the Burren|editor-last1 =O'Connell|editor-first1 =J.W.|editor-last2 =Korff|editor-first2 =Anne|volume = |pages =119-34|place = |publisher =Tir Eolas|id = }}</ref>{{rp|127,129}}\n\nThe O'Loughlin (\u00d3 Lochlainn) clan ruled ''Boireann'' down to the mid-17th century from their chief residence at [[Gregans Castle]] (the tower house, not the house of the same name). The chief of the family was known in later times as the 'Prince of Burren' and clan members were buried in the family tomb near the altar of Corcomroe Abbey. Their kinsmen, the O'Conor (\u00d3 Conchubhair), clan ruled ''Corco Modhruadh Iartharach'' from [[Dough Castle]] near [[Liscannor]]. The villages and towns found within the medieval territory of Boireann include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, New Quay (Newquay) / Burrin (Burren), [[Noughaval]], Bealaclugga (Bellharbour), [[Carran|Carron]] and Fanore / Craggagh.\n\nBoth clans were eventually subjects of the O'Briens, the rulers of [[Thomond]]. Especially in the southwest, the O'Briens sometimes extended their direct influence, taking over houses and territories for themselves. They controlled the castles at [[Dromoland Castle|Dromoland]] and [[Leamaneh Castle|Leamaneh]] and later became the [[Baron Inchiquin|Barons Inchiquin]].<ref name=\"Explore\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\n==Culture==\nThe Burren has a long history of traditional Irish music. It is particularly known for the \"West Clare Style\" of [[concertina]] playing, and music festivals in [[Doolin]] and [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]].  The area also has a long history as a source of artistic inspiration, and has hosted a number of art galleries.\n\nThe Burren has inspired many non-fiction books, often accompanied by extensive illustration of the landscape.  A series of [[detective fiction]] novels, written by Cora Harrison, features the Burren's [[brehon]] judge (fictional) in the early 1500s, when the area still existed as a distinct Gaelic administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|title=Severn House|website=severnhouse.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122235021/http://severnhouse.com/author/Cora+Harrison/9419|archivedate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Economic activity==\nThe leading economic activities in the Burren are agriculture and tourism.\n\n===Tourism===\nThe Burren has a reputation beyond Ireland, and, most notably with the Cliffs of Moher, but also with the major [[show caves]], [[dolmens]] such as at [[Poulnabrone]] and other prehistoric sites, and centres of cultural activity, attracts tourists from a wide range of countries.  There are a range of hotels, hostels, bed and breakfast facilities, and other accommodation providers.\n\nTourism presents some challenges in such an environmentally sensitive area, as it creates mostly seasonal employment, results in a large share of local houses being used only in the summer, and puts additional strain on environmental resources, thus exacerbating the effect of a significant increase in the number of houses in some areas during the 1990s and 2000s.  This has been a thread in the development and preservation activities previously discussed, and has driven the growth of local ecotourism, and the \"Leave No Trace\" local campaigns.  Concerns have also arisen about the level of day-tourism, especially by coaches, as opposed to overnight-staying tourists, who generate significantly more revenue.\n\n====Ecotourism in the Burren====\n[[Ecotourism]] is an important factor in The Burren, with many organisations involved, including the Burren Ecotourism Network. A key goal is to deal with the challenge of protecting the vulnerable landscape, while at the same time having it provide a fair income for the local inhabitants and allowing it to cope with increased visitor numbers. [[Sustainability|Sustainable]] ecotourism and independent \"'Ecotourism Certification\" for companies are intended to deal with those conflicting demands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|title=Burren EcoTourism {{!}} The Burren Centre|website=www.theburrencentre.ie|access-date=2 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820015209/http://www.theburrencentre.ie/burren-ecotourism/|archivedate=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Gastro-tourism====\nA Burren Food Trail was launched in 2013, and has more than 20 members offering hospitality, and / or food and drink products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|title=Burren Food Trail - Visit the Burren|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028220623/http://www.burren.ie/food-dining/burren-food-trail/|archivedate=2017-10-28}}</ref> The trail won the Irish prize in the European Destination of Excellence - Tourism and Local Gastronomy competition in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|title=Failte Ireland - The Burren Food Trail is Cream of the Crop|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129140453/http://www.failteireland.ie/footer/media-centre/the-burren-food-trail-is-cream-of-the-crop.aspx|archivedate=2018-01-29}}</ref> In association with the food trail events such as a Slow Food festival and a Food Fayre are organised.

Arable farming is limited, and the main animals kept are cattle and goats.\n\nAs summarized by local landscape organisation, the Burrenbeo Trust<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritagecouncil.ie/our-work-with-others/burren-beo-trust|title=Burren Beo Trust|website=Heritagecouncil.ie|}}</ref>, the traditional local system of cattle husbandry \"involves exploiting the unusual attributes afforded by the region's limestone geology. Up until quite recently, hardy native breeds of beef cattle were used to graze upland grasslands between the months of October and April, requiring scarcely any dietary supplement prior to their removal to finishing grass elsewhere.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|title=Farming in the Burren|website=www.askaboutireland.ie|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122181644/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/life-society/farming/farming-in-ireland-overvi/farming-in-the-burren/|archivedate=2018-01-22}}</ref> Thus the agricultural methods used but also protected the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|title=Agriculture - Burrenbeo Trust|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070640/https://burrenbeo.com/the-burren/natural-heritage/agriculture/|archivedate=2018-01-24}}</ref>\n\n====Challenges====\nSince the 20th century the spread of intensive farming techniques (including sometimes heavy use of nitrate fertilisers) along with the possibilities offered by heavy equipment to transform limestone pavement into pasture has posed new challenges for the ecosystem and its diversity. Research conducted in the 1990s suggests that by the end of that decade the area of limestone pavement had halved since pre-Famine times, c. 1840, while from the 1970s to the 1990s alone, about 4% of pavements were converted into pasture or covered by roads. \n\nDespite the intensification of agriculture on the uplands{{cn|date=January 2018}}, population numbers fell from around 4,000 at the beginning of the 20th century to roughly 2,500 by the time of the 1991 Census, before rising once more.

These colonised more of the limestone area as a result of reduced grazing by cattle and goats. The increasing industrialization of agriculture and the introduction of different breeds of cattle led to shifts in cattle-raising practices \u2013 away from winter grazing, which kept down new growth, and towards supplementary feeding.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In addition, in the past saplings were often pulled from fields by hand to maintain grazing areas. Trees also used to be harvested for firewood, hazel rods were used for thatching as well as for fence- and basket-making. As these practices ceased, the brush advanced. This notably reduces biodiversity in the affected areas.<ref name=\"Dunford\"/>{{rp|236-8}}\n\n====BurrenLIFE====\nIn response to under-grazing, loss of husbandry and land management traditions, and abandonment and consolidation of farms, the BurrenLIFE program, coordinated by the geopark, launched a new sustainable farming initiative.  This began with twenty farms, representative of the diversity of local agriculture, for each of which a specific plan of costed actions was devised.  After refinement, the initiative was extended to 320 farmers over two phases, and another 130 are expected to join a final phase.  Typical recommendations enacted included scrub clearance, restoration of drystone walls, reduction in silage usage and a return to winter grazing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|title=A new project is saving the unique landscape of the Burren|first=Hayley|last=Halpin|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122056/http://www.thejournal.ie/eu-life-nature-award-burren-life-project-3423137-Jun2017/|archivedate=2017-06-06}}</ref>\n\n===Balancing needs===\nFor the past decades, the government and private groups have attempted to square the demands of local farmers, tourists and the environment.  In particular, sometimes outdated or leaky septic tanks used by rural houses have contributed to the damage done to groundwater by agricultural practices.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In a limestone environment, the use of percolation and septic tanks may in fact not be a viable alternative to sewage treatment.{{cn|date=January 2018}} However, this is still lacking in much of the area.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.<ref name=\"mmajunkie.com\"/>  In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition.

Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''

Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]].

Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates).

Due to the Earth's [[axial tilt]], the course of a year sees the passing of the [[season]]s, marked by change in [[weather]], the hours of [[daylight]], and, consequently, [[vegetation]] and [[soil fertility]].\nIn [[temperate]] and [[subpolar climate|subpolar]] regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: [[spring (season)|spring]], [[summer]], [[autumn]], and [[winter]]. In [[tropics|tropical]] and [[subtropics|subtropical]] regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the [[tropics#Seasons and climate|seasonal tropics]], the annual [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s are recognized and tracked.\n\nA [[calendar year]] is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given [[calendar]]. The [[Gregorian calendar]], or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a [[common year]] of 365 days or a [[leap year]] of 366 days, as do the [[Julian calendar]]s; ''see'' [[#In international calendars|below]]. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The [[ISO]] standard [[ISO 80000-3]], Annex C, supports the symbol ''a'' (for Latin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'') to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations ''y'' and ''yr'' are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] is a [[unit of time]]; it is defined as 365.25 [[day]]s of exactly 86,400 [[second]]s ([[SI base unit]]), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] |url=http://www.iau.org/science/publications/proceedings_rules/units/ |title=SI units |accessdate=February 18, 2010}} (See Table 5 and Section 5.15.)

The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the [[Great Year]].<ref>[[OED]], s.v. \"year\", entry 2.b.: \"''transf.''

Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix [[ablaut]]) are [[Avestan]] ''y\u0101r\u01dd'' \"year\", [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f65\u03c1\u03b1}} (h\u1e53ra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"[[hour]]\"), [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''jar\u016d'', and [[Latin]] ''hornus'' \"of this year\". <!--root [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h\u2081ey-]] \"go\", needs reference to deal with the \"laryingealistic\" problems-->\n\nLatin ''[[:wikt:annus|annus]]'' (a [[2nd declension]] masculine noun; ''annum'' is the [[accusative case|accusative singular]]; ''ann\u012b'' is genitive singular and nominative plural; ''ann\u014d'' the dative and ablative singular) is from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] noun ''{{PIE|*h\u2082et-no-}}'', which also yielded Gothic ''a\u00fen'' \"year\" (only the dative plural ''a\u00fenam'' is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic ''*yeh\u2081r-o-'', there is evidence for an original derivation with an ''*-r/n'' suffix, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-''. Both Indo-European words for year, ''*yeh\u2081-ro-'' and ''*h\u2082et-no-'', would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", ''*h\u2081ey-'' and ''*h\u2082et-'', respectively  (compare [[Vedic Sanskrit]] ''\u00e9ti'' \"goes\", ''atasi'' \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin ''annus'', such as [[wikt:annual|annual]], [[:wikt:annuity|annuity]], [[:wikt:anniversary|anniversary]], etc.; ''[[:wikt:per annum|per annum]]'' means \"each year\", ''[[anno Domini]]'' means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, is cognate with Latin ''vetus'' \"old\", from the PIE word ''*wetos-'' \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in [[Sanskrit]]  ''{{IAST|vat-sa-ras}}'' \"year\" and ''{{IAST|vat-sa-}}'' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin ''[[:wikt:vitulus|vitulus]]'' \"bull calf\",  English ''wether'' \"ram\" (Old English ''we\u00f0er'', Gothic ''wi\u00ferus'' \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese [[:wikt:\u5e74|\u5e74]] \"year\", originally [[:wikt:\u79c2|\u79c2]], an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/god\u044a|god\u016d]]'' \"time period; year\" uses ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/l\u011bto|l\u011bto]]'' \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]] ([[ISO 80000-3]]), the year (symbol, ''a'') is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\n== Intercalation ==\nAstronomical years do not have an [[integer]] number of days or lunar months. Any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]] such as leap years.\n\n=== Julian calendar ===\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is [[intercalation (timekeeping)#Solar calendars|intercalated]] into the month of February. The name \"[[Leap Day]]\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe [[Revised Julian calendar]], proposed in 1923 and used in some [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es,\nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for  the average (mean) year length of {{val|365.2422222}} days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, {{val|365.24219}} days (relative error of 9\u00b710<sup>\u22128</sup>).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.<ref>Shields, Miriam Nancy.

It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\n===Other calendars===\n{{see|Lunisolar calendar}}\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire [[leap month]]s on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons ([[Hebrew calendar]], various [[Hindu calendar]]s).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical [[Jalali calendar]], known as the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] (1925), is a purely [[solar calendar]] with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year ([[Nowruz]]) on the day of [[vernal equinox]] (for the time zone of [[Tehran]]), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\n==Year numbering==\nA [[calendar era]] assigns a [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]] to each sequential  year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the [[Anno Domini]], although some prefer the term [[Common Era]] because it has no explicit reference to [[Christianity]]. It was introduced in the 6th century and was intended to count years from the [[nativity of Jesus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=E.G. |date=2013 |contribution=Calendars |editor1-first=S.E. |editor1-last=Urban |editor2-first=P.K. |editor2-last=Seidelmann |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/c15_usb_online.pdf |title=Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac |edition=3rd |pages=585, 590 |location=Mill Valley, CA |publisher=University Science Books |isbn=978-1-891389-85-6}} Richards does not explicitly say that Anno Domini is the worldwide standard, but does say on page 585 that the Gregorian calendar is used throughout the world for secular purposes.</ref>\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for [[Anno Domini]] \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"[[Common Era]]\". Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for [[Before Christ]] or alternatively BCE for [[Before the Common Era]].\nYear numbers are based on [[inclusive counting]], so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of [[Astronomical year numbering]], positive numbers indicate years AD, the number [[0 (year)|0]] designates [[1 BC]], \u22121 designates [[2 BC]], and so on.\n\n==Pragmatic divisions==\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a [[365-day calendar]] to simplify daily rates.\n\n=== Fiscal year ===\nA [[fiscal year]] or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in [[Canada]] and [[India]] the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the [[United Kingdom]] it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits;  in [[Australia]] it runs from July 1; while in the [[United States]] the fiscal year of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] runs from October 1.\n\n=== Academic year ===\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an [[educational institution]]. The academic year may be divided into [[academic term]]s, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July.  In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the [[Hebrew Calendar]].\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into ''three'' roughly equal-length terms (called ''trimesters'' or ''quarters'' in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis.  Other schools break the year into ''two'' main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a ''quarter'' (or ''term'' in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have ''four'' marking periods.  Some schools in the United States, notably [[Boston Latin School]], may divide the year into ''five or more'' marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a [[positive correlation]] between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\n== Astronomical years == <!-- This section is linked from [[Season]] -->\n{{see also|Astronomical month}}\n\n=== Julian year ===\n{{Main|Julian year (astronomy)}}\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the [[Latin]] ''annus'') used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of {{val|36525}} days and the Julian millennium of {{val|365250}} days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a [[light-year]].\n\nIn the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]], the symbol, ''a'' (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, ''a<sub>j</sub>'', of exactly {{val|31557600}} [[second]]s.\n\n:365.25 days of {{val|86400}} seconds = 1 a = 1 a<sub>j</sub> = {{val|31.5576}} [[Second#SI multiples|Ms]]\n\nThe [[#SI prefix multipliers|SI multiplier prefixes]] may be applied to it to form ''ka'' (kiloannus), ''Ma'' (megaannus), etc.\n\n=== Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years ===\n{{hatnote|The relations among these are considered more fully in [[Axial precession (astronomy)]].}}\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an ''astronomical year''.\n\nThe [[sidereal year]] is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its [[orbit]], as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin ''sidera'', singular ''sidus'').  Its average duration is {{val|365.256363004}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch [[J2000.0]] = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]).<ref>International Earth Rotation and Reference System Service.

Because of the Earth's [[axial precession (astronomy)|axial precession]], this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year.  The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition.<ref>\n{{cite book\n |url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecM/Glossary.html#y\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2011\n |year=2009\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = M18 (Glossary)\n}}</ref> (= 365.24219 days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its [[Apsis|apsides]]. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the [[perihelion]], where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 5, 07:48 UT in 2020), and the [[aphelion]], where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 11:35 UT in 2020). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages.

The year is associated with [[eclipse]]s: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two [[eclipse season]]s every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n:{{val|346.620075883}} days (346 d 14 h 52 min 54 s) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of [[lunar precession]], that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: {{val|18.612815932}} Julian years ({{val|6798.331019}} days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Full moon cycle ===\nThe [[full moon cycle]] is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the [[perigee]] of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the [[full moon]], and also with the varying duration of the [[month|synodic month]]. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n:{{val|411.78443029}} days (411 days 18 hours 49 minutes 35 seconds) (at the epoch J2000.0).\n\n=== Lunar year ===\nThe [[lunar year]] comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. [[Muslims]] use this for celebrating their [[Muslim holidays|Eids]] and for marking the start of the fasting month of [[Ramadan]].\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\n=== Vague year ===\nThe vague year, from ''annus vagus'' or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years.  Typically the vague year is divided into 12 [[wikt:schematic|schematic]] months of 30 days each plus 5 [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|epagomenal]] days.  The vague year was used in the calendars of [[Ethiopian calendar|Ethiopia]], [[Egyptian calendar|Ancient Egypt]], [[Iranian calendar|Iran]], [[Armenian calendar|Armenia]] and in [[Mesoamerican calendars|Mesoamerica]] among the [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] and [[Haab'|Maya]].<ref>[http://www.mayacalendar.com/descripcion.html Calendar Description and Coordination] Maya World Studies Center</ref>   It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\n=== Heliacal year ===\nA heliacal year is the interval between the [[heliacal rising]]s of a star. It differs from the [[sidereal year]] for stars away from the [[ecliptic]] due mainly to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Sothic year ===\nThe [[Sothic cycle|Sothic year]] is the interval between heliacal risings of the star [[Sirius]]. It is currently less than the [[#Sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years|sidereal year]] and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\n=== Gaussian year ===\nThe [[Gaussian year]] is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n:{{val|365.2568983}} days (365 d 6 h 9 min 56 s).\n\n=== Besselian year === <!-- This section is linked from [[Universal Time]] -->\nThe [[Besselian epoch#Besselian years|Besselian year]] is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280\u00b0. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician [[Friedrich Bessel]]. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):<ref>\n{{cite book\n |title=Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010\n |year=2008\n |publisher = U.S. Government Printing Office and the U.K. Hydrographic Office\n |location = Washington and Taunton\n |page = B3\n|title-link=Astronomical Almanac\n }}</ref>\n: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date<sub>TT</sub> \u2212 {{val|2415020.31352}}) / {{val|365.242198781}}\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale, or its predecessor, [[ephemeris time]].<!-- Capitalization follows that of the glossary of the ''Astronomical Almanac for the Year 2010'' -->\n\n=== Variation in the length of the year and the day ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2012}}\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n* The positions of the equinox and solstice points with respect to the apsides of Earth's orbit change: the equinoxes and solstices move westward relative to the stars because of [[precession]], and the apsides move in the other direction because of the long-term effects of gravitational pull by the other planets.  Since the speed of the Earth varies according to its position in its orbit as measured from its perihelion, Earth's speed when in a solstice or equinox point changes over time: if such a point moves toward perihelion, the interval between two passages decreases a little from year to year; if the point moves towards aphelion, that period increases a little from year to year.  So a \"tropical year\" measured from one passage of the northward (\"vernal\") equinox to the next, differs from the one measured between passages of the southward (\"autumnal\") equinox.  The average over the full orbit does not change because of this, so the length of the average tropical year does not change because of this second-order effect.\n* Each planet's movement is perturbed by the gravity of every other planet.  This leads to short-term fluctuations in its speed, and therefore its period from year to year.  Moreover, it causes long-term changes in its orbit, and therefore also long-term changes in these periods.\n* [[Tidal drag]] between the Earth and the Moon and Sun increases the length of the day and of the month (by transferring angular momentum from the rotation of the Earth to the revolution of the Moon); since the apparent mean solar day is the unit with which we measure the length of the year in civil life, the length of the year appears to decrease.  The rotation rate of the Earth is also changed by factors such as [[post-glacial rebound]] and [[sea level rise]].\n\n==== Numerical value of year variation ====\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years.

The unit of time is the modern year as presently recognized worldwide.  Recommended (but not mandatory) abbreviations for such ages are SI (International System of Units) multipliers coupled with \"a\" for annus: ka, Ma, and Ga for kilo-annus (10<sup>3</sup> years), Mega-annus (10<sup>6</sup> years), and Giga-annus (10<sup>9</sup> years), respectively. Use of these terms after the age value follows the convention established in the field of C-14 dating. The \"present\" refers to AD 1950, and such qualifiers as \"ago\" or \"before the present\" are omitted after the value because measurement of the duration from the present to the past is implicit in the designation. In contrast, the duration of a remote interval of geologic time, as a number of years, should not be expressed by the same symbols. Abbreviations for numbers of years, without reference to the present, are informal (e.g., y or yr for years; my, m.y., or m.yr. for millions of years; and so forth, as preference dictates). For example, boundaries of the Late Cretaceous Epoch currently are calibrated at 63 Ma and 96 Ma, but the interval of time represented by this epoch is 33 m.y.\n}}</ref> They are not SI units, using ''y'' to abbreviate the English \"[[:wikt:year|year]]\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or [[metric prefix]]es (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g).
