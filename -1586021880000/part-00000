Ballabhgarh====\nList of rulers:{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n* Raja Gopal Singh (1705\u201311)\n* Raja Charan Das (1711-1714), Gopal Singh's son\n* Raja Balram Singh (1714-29 November 1753), Charan Das's son, founder of Ballabhgarh fort town\n* Bisan Singh (Nazim) and Kisan Singh (Kiledar) (1753-1774), sons of Balram Singh\n* Ajit Singh \"Raja\" (1774-1793), assisted by Hira Singh (titled \"Raja\" and \"Salar Jang\"), Ajit Singh murdered by his brother Zalim Singh.  \n* Raja Bahadur Singh (1793-1806),  Hira Singh's son \n* Raja Narain Singh (1806-1806), Bahadur Singh's son \n* Raja Anirudh Singh (1806-1819), Narain's son \n* Raja Sahib Singh (1819-1825), infant son of Anirudh Singh died childless in 1825\n* Raja Ram Singh (1825-1829), Sahib Singh's uncle and Anirudh Singh's

Ballabhgarh jagir abolished and came under direct British rule. Nahar's adopted son and nephew, Kushal Singh, left Ballabhgarh and later became inheritor of jagir of his wife at [[Kuchesar]].\n\n====The founder: Gopal Singh ====\nGopal Singh, a [[Teotia|Tewatia]] Jat, the founder of the princely state of Ballabgarh, migrated from Alwalpur village in 1705, and established himself at [[Sihi]] ({{convert|5|km|mi}} from Ballabhgarh) after displacing Taga [[Brahman]] farmers there. Gopal Singh Tewatia of Sihi started establishing his power in Delhi, [[Khair]] and [[Mathura]] areas. He attacked [[Rajput]] of that area with the help of people of Lagon village. He became more powerful and richer and started to waylay the mughal travelers on Delhi-Agra royal route during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] (d. 1707). In 1710, during the reign of Aurangzeb's son [[Bahadur Shah I]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] officer Murtaza Khan of Faridabad signed a treaty with Goapl Singh confirming Gopal as [[Chaudhary]] of Faridabad [[pargana]]. He wanted to expand his army and collect huge wealth but soon died in 1711.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nGopal's successor was his son Charan Das Tewatia, who was also ambitious. When Charan Das saw weakening of the Mughal rule, he stopped paying ''malgujari'' (octroi) to Mughals. As a result, Mughals arrested and imprisoned Charan Das at Faridabad fort for a short time in 1714 during the reign of [[Farrukhsiyar]] (r. 1713-1719). His son Balram Singh freed him by pretending to pay the ransom.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Charan Das's son, Balram Singh, later rose to be a powerful king.\n\n====Expansion: Balram Singh (Ballu Jat) ====\n\nIn 1720 farmers rose in revolt under the leadership of Balram Singh (Ballu Jat) when during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] (r. 1719-1748), Mughal officer of Faridabad Murtaza Khan started to impose heavy taxes while famine was raging. Murtaza Khan had in the past also imprisoned Balram's father. Balram killed Murtaza Khan at Faridabad and shut the Mughal traffic on Delhi-Agra route. In 1739, Mughal king bestowed on him titles of \"Rao\" and \"Naib Bakshi\". He built the Nahar Singh fort and founded the city of Ballabhgarh is named after him.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Jats along the Delhi-Agra route at that time were in revolt against the oppressive Mughal rule. Tewatias of this area had already established themselves as counter force in this area. Balram Jat held the surrounding country as a feudatory of [[Suraj Mal of Bharatpur]] (r. 1755 \u2013 1763). He was the brother-in-law of [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]] and mama of [[Jawahar Singh]]. Balram Singh often called Ballu by the local people moved on a few Elephants, Horses and Camels loaded with Big drums (Nagaade) and Dhaunse (big band) followed by his local army. Went wherever Ballu with this band, it was assumed that area was no longer of Mughals and Ballu had won that. It was a kind of [[Ashvamedha|Aswamedh Yagna]] that he performed. Here from started a saying \"Dheeng Dheeng Ballu ka Raj\". Immediately peace returned to those areas, which were won over by Ballu.\n\nOn 11 January 1750, Jat [[sangh (disambiguation)|sangh]] of Balram Singh of Ballabhgarh, Suraj Mal of [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]] and [[Bhim Singh Rana]] of [[Gohad]] waged a battle against Mughal forces of [[Safdar Jang]] (b.1708 - d.1754) of [[Oudh State|Oudh]] and Mir Salawat Khan during the reign of Mughal emperor [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]] (r. 1748- 1754),{{cn|date=November 2019}}<ref name=balidan26/> which Jats won and mughals had to conceded a lot concessions.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 30 June 1750, Safdar Jung, marched against Balram but Balram managed to evade him using stratagem with the help of Marathas.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Mughal king Ahmad Shah Bahadur replaced Safdar Jung with Gaziuddin Khan (\"Intizam-Ud-Daullahas\" or \"lmad-ul-Mulk\", the imperial [[Akbar#Political government|Mir Bakhshi]]) as new wizir. Safdar Jung, supported by Balram Jat and Surajmal Jat, revolted against the Mughal king. Murtija Khan's son Aqaibet Mahmud Khan was the chief diwan of Gaziuddin Khan, he and Balram agreed to meet to negotiate the terms of truce. Balram arrived with his son, diwan and 250 men, angry words flew, Balram put his hand on his sword, Aquibat's guard suddenly fell upon Balram and killed him, his son, diwan and 9 other escorts. Maharaja Suraj Mal Jat retaliated by capturing [[Palwal]] from Mughals on 27 September 1754. He also caught the [[qazi]] there and slayed the qanungo Santokh Rai for scheming Balram's murder. In November 1755, Jats under Suraj Mal also recaptured Ballabgarh and Ghasira from Mughals. Suraj Mal appointed sons of Balram, Bishan Singh as Nazim and Kishan Singh as kiledar, who stayed in these roles till 1774 under Suraj Mal.<ref name=balidan26>Asloub Ansari, 2001,[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8174352767 SIR SYED AHMED KHAN : ( A Centenary Tribute )], Page 166.</ref>{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nFrom 1757 to 1760, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]] waged war against Jats and Marathas.

In 1775, Ajit Singh was formally appointed Raja of Ballabhgarh under Mughal authority. In 1793, Ajit Singh was killed by his brother Zalim Singh, and Ajit's son Bahadur Singh became the king.

Ballabhgarh====\nList of rulers:{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n* Raja Gopal Singh (1705\u201311)\n* Raja Charan Das (1711-1714), Gopal Singh's son\n* Raja Balram Singh (1714-29 November 1753), Charan Das's son, founder of Ballabhgarh fort town\n* Bisan Singh (Nazim) and Kisan Singh (Kiledar) (1753-1774), sons of Balram Singh\n* Ajit Singh \"Raja\" (1774-1793), assisted by Hira Singh (titled \"Raja\" and \"Salar Jang\"), Ajit Singh murdered by his brother Zalim Singh.  \n* Raja Bahadur Singh (1793-1806),  Hira Singh's son \n* Raja Narain Singh (1806-1806), Bahadur Singh's son \n* Raja Anirudh Singh (1806-1819), Narain's son \n* Raja Sahib Singh (1819-1825), infant son of Anirudh Singh died childless in 1825\n* Raja Ram Singh (1825-1829), Sahib Singh's uncle and Anirudh Singh's brother \n* [[Raja Nahar Singh]] (1829-9 January 1858), Bahadur Singh's son, hanged by British for role in 1857 war of independence. Ballabhgarh jagir abolished and came under direct British rule. Nahar's adopted son and nephew, Kushal Singh, left Ballabhgarh and later became inheritor of jagir of his wife at [[Kuchesar]].\n\n====The founder: Gopal Singh ====\nGopal Singh, a [[Teotia|Tewatia]] Jat, the founder of the princely state of Ballabgarh, migrated from Alwalpur village in 1705, and established himself at [[Sihi]] ({{convert|5|km|mi}} from Ballabhgarh) after displacing Taga [[Brahman]] farmers there. Gopal Singh Tewatia of Sihi started establishing his power in Delhi, [[Khair]] and [[Mathura]] areas. He attacked [[Rajput]] of that area with the help of people of Lagon village. He became more powerful and richer and started to waylay the mughal travelers on Delhi-Agra royal route during the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] (d. 1707). In 1710, during the reign of Aurangzeb's son [[Bahadur Shah I]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] officer Murtaza Khan of Faridabad signed a treaty with Goapl Singh confirming Gopal as [[Chaudhary]] of Faridabad [[pargana]]. He wanted to expand his army and collect huge wealth but soon died in 1711.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nGopal's successor was his son Charan Das Tewatia, who was also ambitious. When Charan Das saw weakening of the Mughal rule, he stopped paying ''malgujari'' (octroi) to Mughals. As a result, Mughals arrested and imprisoned Charan Das at Faridabad fort for a short time in 1714 during the reign of [[Farrukhsiyar]] (r. 1713-1719). His son Balram Singh freed him by pretending to pay the ransom.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Charan Das's son, Balram Singh, later rose to be a powerful king.\n\n====Expansion: Balram Singh (Ballu Jat) ====\n\nIn 1720 farmers rose in revolt under the leadership of Balram Singh (Ballu Jat) when during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] (r. 1719-1748), Mughal officer of Faridabad Murtaza Khan started to impose heavy taxes while famine was raging. Murtaza Khan had in the past also imprisoned Balram's father. Balram killed Murtaza Khan at Faridabad and shut the Mughal traffic on Delhi-Agra route. In 1739, Mughal king bestowed on him titles of \"Rao\" and \"Naib Bakshi\". He built the Nahar Singh fort and founded the city of Ballabhgarh is named after him.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Jats along the Delhi-Agra route at that time were in revolt against the oppressive Mughal rule. Tewatias of this area had already established themselves as counter force in this area. Balram Jat held the surrounding country as a feudatory of [[Suraj Mal of Bharatpur]] (r. 1755 \u2013 1763). He was the brother-in-law of [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]] and mama of [[Jawahar Singh]]. Balram Singh often called Ballu by the local people moved on a few Elephants, Horses and Camels loaded with Big drums (Nagaade) and Dhaunse (big band) followed by his local army. Went wherever Ballu with this band, it was assumed that area was no longer of Mughals and Ballu had won that. It was a kind of [[Ashvamedha|Aswamedh Yagna]] that he performed. Here from started a saying \"Dheeng Dheeng Ballu ka Raj\". Immediately peace returned to those areas, which were won over by Ballu.\n\nOn 11 January 1750, Jat [[sangh (disambiguation)|sangh]] of Balram Singh of Ballabhgarh, Suraj Mal of [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]] and [[Bhim Singh Rana]] of [[Gohad]] waged a battle against Mughal forces of [[Safdar Jang]] (b.1708 - d.1754) of [[Oudh State|Oudh]] and Mir Salawat Khan during the reign of Mughal emperor [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]] (r. 1748- 1754),{{cn|date=November 2019}}<ref name=balidan26/> which Jats won and mughals had to conceded a lot concessions.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 30 June 1750, Safdar Jung, marched against Balram but Balram managed to evade him using stratagem with the help of Marathas.{{Cn|date=November 2019}}Mughal king Ahmad Shah Bahadur replaced Safdar Jung with Gaziuddin Khan (\"Intizam-Ud-Daullahas\" or \"lmad-ul-Mulk\", the imperial [[Akbar#Political government|Mir Bakhshi]]) as new wizir. Safdar Jung, supported by Balram Jat and Surajmal Jat, revolted against the Mughal king. Murtija Khan's son Aqaibet Mahmud Khan was the chief diwan of Gaziuddin Khan, he and Balram agreed to meet to negotiate the terms of truce. Balram arrived with his son, diwan and 250 men, angry words flew, Balram put his hand on his sword, Aquibat's guard suddenly fell upon Balram and killed him, his son, diwan and 9 other escorts. Maharaja Suraj Mal Jat retaliated by capturing [[Palwal]] from Mughals on 27 September 1754. He also caught the [[qazi]] there and slayed the qanungo Santokh Rai for scheming Balram's murder. In November 1755, Jats under Suraj Mal also recaptured Ballabgarh and Ghasira from Mughals. Suraj Mal appointed sons of Balram, Bishan Singh as Nazim and Kishan Singh as kiledar, who stayed in these roles till 1774 under Suraj Mal.<ref name=balidan26>Asloub Ansari, 2001,[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8174352767 SIR SYED AHMED KHAN : ( A Centenary Tribute )], Page 166.</ref>{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nFrom 1757 to 1760, [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]] waged war against Jats and Marathas.

In 1775, Ajit Singh was formally appointed Raja of Ballabhgarh under Mughal authority. In 1793, Ajit Singh was killed by his brother Zalim Singh, and Ajit's son Bahadur Singh became the king.
