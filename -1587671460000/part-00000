Many M\u00e9tis felt Canada was not protecting their rights, their land and their survival as a distinct people. Riel had been invited to lead the movement of protest. He turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone. This alienated Catholic clergy, whites, most Indigenous tribes and some M\u00e9tis. But he had the allegiance of a couple hundred armed M\u00e9tis, a smaller number of other Indigenous warriors and at least one white man at Batoche in May 1885, confronting 900 Canadian militia plus some armed local residents. About 91 people would die in the fighting that occurred that spring, before the rebellion's collapse.<ref name=\"James Rodger Miller 2004 44\">{{cite book|author=James Rodger Miller|title=Reflections on Native-newcomer Relations: Selected Essays|url=https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill/page/44 44]}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas Flanagan 2000 pp 3-4\">Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000) pp 3-4</ref><ref>Robert MacIntosh, Boilermakers on the Prairies, p. 16</ref>\n\nDespite some notable early victories at [[Battle of Duck Lake|Duck Lake]], [[Battle of Fish Creek|Fish Creek]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]], the rebellion ended when overwhelming government numbers and a critical shortage of supplies brought about the M\u00e9tis' defeat in the four-day [[Battle of Batoche|Siege of Batoche]]. The remaining Aboriginal allies scattered. Riel was captured and put on trial. He was convicted of treason and despite many pleas across Canada for amnesty, he was hanged.

The railway had been completed across the prairies in 1883, though sections were still under construction north of Lake Superior, making it easier for the government to get troops into the area. In addition, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) had been created, developing an armed local force. Riel lacked support from English settlers of the area as well as the great majority of tribes. Riel's claim that God had sent him back to Canada as a prophet caused Catholic officials (who saw it as heresy) to try to minimize his support.

After Duck Lake, the government immediately commenced the mobilization of some of Canada's ill-equipped part-time militia units (the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]]), as well as the units of cavalry, artillery and infantry regulars that made up the tiny [[Permanent Active Militia]], Canada's almost-nonexistent regular army. By March 30, after hasty mobilization in Toronto, two trains containing the [[The Royal Regiment of Canada|10th Royal Grenadiers]] and [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada|Queen's Own Rifles]] militia battalions were ready to leave Toronto. Other militia units, the 9th [[Les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec|Voltigeurs]] from Quebec City, and the [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal|65th Mount Royal Rifles]] from Montreal, were also quickly mobilized. Soon every major city in the East was the scene of embarkation for inexperienced young militiamen cheered by immense crowds.\n\nThe first militia to struggle westward had to contend with the many lengthy breaks in the CPR line in northern Ontario. They marched through snow, or were carried in exposed sleighs.

Many of the soldiers suffered greatly from the winter weather.

Many M\u00e9tis felt Canada was not protecting their rights, their land and their survival as a distinct people. Riel had been invited to lead the movement of protest. He turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone. This alienated Catholic clergy, whites, most Indigenous tribes and some M\u00e9tis. But he had the allegiance of a couple hundred armed M\u00e9tis, a smaller number of other Indigenous warriors and at least one white man at Batoche in May 1885, confronting 900 Canadian militia plus some armed local residents. About 91 people would die in the fighting that occurred that spring, before the rebellion's collapse.<ref name=\"James Rodger Miller 2004 44\">{{cite book|author=James Rodger Miller|title=Reflections on Native-newcomer Relations: Selected Essays|url=https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill/page/44 44]}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas Flanagan 2000 pp 3-4\">Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000) pp 3-4</ref><ref>Robert MacIntosh, Boilermakers on the Prairies, p. 16</ref>\n\nDespite some notable early victories at [[Battle of Duck Lake|Duck Lake]], [[Battle of Fish Creek|Fish Creek]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]], the rebellion ended when overwhelming government numbers and a critical shortage of supplies brought about the M\u00e9tis' defeat in the four-day [[Battle of Batoche|Siege of Batoche]]. The remaining Aboriginal allies scattered. Riel was captured and put on trial. He was convicted of treason and despite many pleas across Canada for amnesty, he was hanged.

The railway had been completed across the prairies in 1883, though sections were still under construction north of Lake Superior, making it easier for the government to get troops into the area. In addition, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) had been created, developing an armed local force. Riel lacked support from English settlers of the area as well as the great majority of tribes. Riel's claim that God had sent him back to Canada as a prophet caused Catholic officials (who saw it as heresy) to try to minimize his support. The Catholic priest, [[Albert Lacombe]], worked to obtain assurances from [[Crowfoot]] that his [[Blackfoot]] warriors would not participate in a rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|title=The Early West|year=1957|publisher=Historical Society of Alberta|location=Edmonton|page=21|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=245933|access-date=2013-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904074848/http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=245933|archive-date=2015-09-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Location_map+\n|Canada Saskatchewan|relief=yes \n| width = 275\n| float = right\n| caption = The [[District of Saskatchewan]] in 1885 (within the black diamonds) included the central section of Saskatchewan and extended into present-day Alberta and Manitoba.

After Duck Lake, the government immediately commenced the mobilization of some of Canada's ill-equipped part-time militia units (the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]]), as well as the units of cavalry, artillery and infantry regulars that made up the tiny [[Permanent Active Militia]], Canada's almost-nonexistent regular army. By March 30, after hasty mobilization in Toronto, two trains containing the [[The Royal Regiment of Canada|10th Royal Grenadiers]] and [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada|Queen's Own Rifles]] militia battalions were ready to leave Toronto. Other militia units, the 9th [[Les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec|Voltigeurs]] from Quebec City, and the [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal|65th Mount Royal Rifles]] from Montreal, were also quickly mobilized. Soon every major city in the East was the scene of embarkation for inexperienced young militiamen cheered by immense crowds.\n\nThe first militia to struggle westward had to contend with the many lengthy breaks in the CPR line in northern Ontario. They marched through snow, or were carried in exposed sleighs. Where there were short stretches of track, the militia rode on hastily-constructed railroad flatcars which did nothing to shelter them from the extreme cold. Many of the soldiers suffered greatly from the winter weather.

The agency's bus system has 170 routes and 43 bus rapid transit (BRT) stations on Ottawa's [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]]. These routes also provide service to the downtown core of the neighbouring city of [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]], especially during rush hour. Rush-hour service is also provided to a park and ride lot in the [[Russell, Ontario|Township of Russell]].

This private enterprise eventually provided heated streetcar service covering the downtown core.{{sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=28}} Electricity had been employed in a few places in Ottawa since the first demonstration of the incandescent bulb in 1883 (the earliest were Parliament Hill and [[LeBreton Flats]]).{{sfn|Woods|pp=162}} In May 1885, electric lighting commenced in the city.  In 1885 council contracted [[Hydro Ottawa|Ottawa Electric Light Company]] to install 165 arc lamps on the city's streets.{{sfn|Woods|pp=162}}\n\n===1970s: Formation, early Transitway and first strike===\nTransit in Ottawa was provided by the [[Ottawa Transportation Commission]] until 1973 when transit service in the city and its suburbs was transferred under the auspices of the [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton]]. Its formal name was the '''Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission''', but the service was promoted in both English and French under the '''OC Transpo''' name, whose OC initials are derived from '''O'''ttawa-'''C'''arleton.\n\nIn 1973, OC Transpo introduced the first BRT system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first element of its BRT system was dedicated bus lanes through the city centre, with platformed stops. This was part of what later became the Transitway.\n\nThe 20-day 1979 strike was fought over a wage difference of a nickel and became known as \"the five-cent bus strike\".  A pay increase of 16.5% was rejected by the union.<ref name=NP09Dec2008>{{cite news | url=https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=1052073 | publisher=[[National Post]] | title=Ottawa transit talks break off, strike looms | date=2008-12-09 | accessdate=2009-01-21 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===1980s: Transitway===\n{{Main|Transitway (Ottawa)}}\nIn the early 1980s, OC Transpo began planning for a [[bus rapid transit]] system, the Transitway.

The service consists of one north-south line, with major points of interest including [[Carleton University]] and the [[South Keys Shopping Centre]]. In late 2014, this line became known as [[Trillium Line]], or O-Train Line 2, to allow for expansion of the O-Train brand.\n\nThe province of Ontario ordered the amalgamation of the [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton]] and its component municipalities into a single City of Ottawa municipality. When the new local governance took effect in 2001, OC Transpo became a department of the new city.\n\nFollowing amalgamation, a [[bilingual]] [[Backronym#Replacement|replacement backronym]] for \"OC\" was sought, but no suitable candidates have been found. The anachronistic acronym has been kept, instead of the costly task of replacing the decals on all buses, bus stops, bus stations, and promotional material. Thus, \"OC\" is an [[Acronym#Pseudo-acronyms|orphan initialism]].\n\nA new section of the southwest Transitway opened on December 12, 2005, between the [[Nepean Sportsplex]] and Fallowfield Station. The new section runs parallel to [[Woodroffe Avenue (Ottawa)|Woodroffe Avenue]] and was built at a cost of $10 million. The new section has no stations and has replaced service along [[Woodroffe Avenue (Ottawa)|Woodroffe Avenue]] between the Nepean Sportsplex and [[Fallowfield station (OC Transpo)|Fallowfield]]. The Transitway was further expanded south into [[Barrhaven]] with [[Strandherd Station (OC Transpo)|Strandherd]] opened on January 2, 2007. There are also long range plans for other extensions in the [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario|Orleans]] and [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]] areas to keep up with more growing communities.\n\nFollowing the [[2006 Ottawa municipal election|2006 municipal election campaign]], [[Larry O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Larry O'Brien]] was elected as mayor and cancelled the light rail expansion project, per a campaign promise. City Council decided to annul the project by a margin of 13\u201311 on December 14, 2006.

All other customers must board at the back of the bus. As a result, cash fares are neither accepted nor enforced on buses, but a valid fare is required to begin a trip at an O-Train station. On March 19, due to lower ridership and in consideration of train operators, a small number of seats on Confederation Line vehicles became unavailable to the public.<ref>{{cite web |title=COVID-19 |url=https://www.octranspo.com/en/news/category/covid-19/ |website=OC Transpo |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |date=March 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Features ==\nOC Transpo has a fleet of 944 buses that run on regular streets, all of which are fully accessible [[low-floor bus]]es.<ref name=fleet>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/bus_fleet |title=OC Transpo \u2013 Bus Fleet |publisher=octranspo.com |date=2010-12-31 |accessdate=2014-04-12}}</ref> OC Transpo uses many [[articulated bus]]es to provide service. Some of the routes that run on the Transitway, including the city's most-used bus routes, are served almost exclusively by articulated buses (e.g., routes 57, 61, 62, and 75). Peak hour connexion routes are served primarily by Double Decker buses. \n[[File:Otrain ottawa alstom coradia lint.jpg|left|thumb|The [[O-Train]] ([[Trillium Line]]) at [[Carleton University]]]]\nIn 2001, a pilot diesel-powered light rail service project, the original [[O-Train]] known today as the [[Trillium Line]], was introduced. The local government announced expansion plans for the light rail to other parts of Ottawa, including a possible link to the [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa International Airport]]. Service to Gatineau would have also been possible, over the nearby [[Prince of Wales Bridge (Canada)|Prince of Wales railway bridge]] over the [[Ottawa River]]. However, on December 14, 2006, [[Ottawa City Council|City Council]] led by Mayor [[Larry O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Larry O'Brien]] cancelled the [[O-Train#North-south light rail expansion project|north-south light rail expansion project]]. A new model of the project, to have a citywide integrated light rail system, was made, with work beginning in 2013 and will be completed in 2023. This new project envisions fully grade separated rapid transit service on the original Transitways from [[Baseline station]] or Moodie dr. in the west to Trim Park and Ride in the east. The gap between the east end west branches of Transitway will be replaced by a new downtown Subway tunnel under Queen and Rideau streets with three underground stations. The O-Train [[Trillium Line]] will be extended to [[Riverside South, Ottawa|Riverside South]] and will include a spur to the [[Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport]], thus creating direct airport to downtown service. As for the suburbs, they will be served by 65&nbsp;km of new Transitways. The first phase of the project, called the [[Confederation Line]] includes 12.5&nbsp;km of rail between [[Tunney's Pasture]] and Blair, including the downtown subway.\n\nFor a number of years, OC Transpo has carried [[Bicycle carrier|bicycle rack]]s on some routes as a part of the \"Rack & Roll\" campaign. These racks carry up to two bicycles at the front of the bus and fold up against the bus when not in use. Although it started only on three routes, this service has been expanded to include routes 12, 61, 85, 88, 94, 95, 97, 99, 101 and 106 with bike racks appearing on other routes from time to time. As well, all D60LF and D60LFR articulated (60-foot long) buses, all [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500]] double-decker buses, and Invero buses 4427\u20134526 (inclusive) have bike racks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes/rack_roll |title=OC Transpo Rack & Roll |publisher=OC Transpo |date=March 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Traditionally, the racks have been available only between April and October, and there has been much debate over continuing the program throughout the year. However, cyclists may use the racks at any time, on any bus that is equipped with a rack (including routes that don't normally offer them), provided there is room for the cyclist in the bus. The O-Train is bicycle accessible year-round.\n\nThere are four bus depots located throughout the city. The largest and headquarters is located at 1500 [[St. Laurent Boulevard]], with two other smaller but frequently used depots being located at 168 Colonnade Road (Merivale Garage) and the other on Queensview Drive (Pinecrest Garage). A major new maintenance depot which opened its doors in 2010 is located on Industrial Avenue.\n\n==Routes==\n{{Main|OC Transpo routes}}\nOC Transpo has 170 bus routes (as of October 6, 2019)<ref name=routes>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes |title=OC Transpo Routes & Maps |publisher=OC Transpo |date= |accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> that are grouped both by their number and the colour with which they are represented on system maps and on bus stop flags.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:Octranspobusinside.JPG|thumb|Inside an OC Transpo bus]]\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, OC Transpo evaluated a double-decker bus on the Transitway and express routes. This bus, an [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500]], can carry nearly 100 passengers. The initial service demonstration ran from June 28 to July 12, 2006, with a further demonstration under winter conditions in February 2007. The City of Ottawa purchased three Alexander Dennis Enviro500 buses and they were delivered in November 2008.  OC Transpo decals were added to the buses in December, but the [[OC Transpo#December 2008 \u2013 February 2009: ATU 279 strike|strike]] delayed the introduction of these buses. The buses started service in February.\n\nIn August 2010, OC Transpo took advantage of an offer by [[New Flyer Industries]], replacing 226 of its older underpowered 60-foot [[New Flyer Low Floor|D60LF]] articulated buses (purchased between 2001 and 2004) with brand new D60LFR models. The bus exchange was completed in March 2011.  OC Transpo also received other incentives as part of the deal, including rebates on the trading-in of the old buses and a credit on new parts. Eighty new D60LFR articulated buses were also purchased from New Flyer, bringing the combined total to 306 buses.<ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\">[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Fast+track+deal+approved+council/2963744/story.html Ottawa Citizen story on new articulated bus purchase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504173014/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Fast+track+deal+approved+council/2963744/story.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.80 |title=New Flyer story on new articulated bus purchase |publisher=Newflyer.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306120047/http://newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.80 |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref> All of the 2001\u20132004 D60LFs are now retired. Some of the older [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]] D60LF sixty-foot articulated buses have caught on fire during the summer of 2006 and the Summer/Fall of 2010, due to overheating engines, effectively putting them out of service.\n\n[[File:Articulated bus Ottawa 11 2011 3507.jpg|thumb|left|OC Transpo [[New Flyer Low Floor|D60LFR]] articulated bus in downtown Ottawa]]\nOC Transpo purchased 75 more Alexander Dennis Enviro500 triple-axle double-decker buses in 2012, to replace older 40-foot models purchased from 1997 to 1999. These extra double-decker buses are used mainly on connexion routes. Double-decker buses use about the same amount of fuel as an articulated 60-foot bus, but only take up the same road area as a regular 40 foot bus, meaning they free up space (especially downtown), and provide increased seated passenger capacity for longer connexion bus routes, lowering OC Transpo's operating costs. As a result of the purchase, the 60-foot articulated buses were being moved from connexion routes to Transitway and other mainline routes, replacing the 40-foot models currently used on some trips by those routes. Those 40-foot models will replace the older 40-foot models currently used on local routes. The older 40-foot buses were retired from service.<ref>[http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/transit_planning ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308210048/http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/transit_planning |date=March 8, 2011 }}</ref> This plan was approved by the Transit Commission on April 20, 2011. The extra 75 Alexander Dennis E500 double-decker buses entered service between fall 2012 and spring 2013.\n\nThe maintenance of the fleet was complicated by adding buses from another manufacturer (OC Transpo already had buses from New Flyer and Orion before purchasing the double-deckers from Alexander Dennis).

The following day Ottawa mayor Jim Watson and transit chair Diane Deans introduced the first of the 75 double-decker buses at a ceremony at Ottawa city hall.

DayPass vouchers were no longer sold since July 1, 2009, leaving only cash and tickets on the bus as a method of payment.\n\nThe '''Family DayPass''' was launched concurrently with the DayPass. At launch, it was available on Sundays and statutory holidays, allowing up to two adults and youth (age 12 or older) to ride the bus with up to four children (age 11 or younger) at the same price of a DayPass. With the discontinuation of DayPass vouchers on July 1, 2009, the Family DayPass was also made available on Saturdays.<ref>{{cite web|author1=OC Transpo|title=New Fares|url=http://www.octranspo.com:80/fares_menue.htm|accessdate=June 22, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930200805/http://www.octranspo.com/fares_menue.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2009|date=July 1, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 2018, OC Transpo launched '''multi-day passes''' (3, 5, or 7 days). This allows multiple days of DayPass service, up to a week, to be purchased in advanced at a lower cost.

Train tickets can be exchanged for a bus transfer on board of an OC Transpo bus. O-Train ticket prices increased over time, but remained lower compared to bus cash fares until July 2013, when OC Transpo increased O-Train ticket prices from $2.85 to $3.40 to match the bus cash fare. This represents an increase of over 19% and happened after the Presto card launch completed. This card is accepted at O-Train stations for a lower train fare. Bus tickets and DayPass vouchers cannot be used on the O-Train. Bus transfers, however, are accepted.\n\nMonthly and annual passes are also available for all route classes with cost differences for adults, students, and seniors. Passes require an OC Transpo photo ID card, which is available at extra cost. Additionally, Ecopasses (reduced-rate monthly passes) are available through participating employers in the city, providing applicable OC Transpo riders with single-card indefinite passes in exchange for a flat bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly payroll deduction.\n\nIn July 2008, fares were increased by 7.5% because of a shortage in funding for the [[City of Ottawa]]. This fare hike was supposed to be in effect until 2010 including a 6.5% hike in 2009. This meant Ottawa residents saw regular adult passes rise from $73 a month to $81 and adult express passes from $90 to $101 a month. However, cash fares remained the same.<ref>{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=1977e375-2fa4-47e1-a04c-d4e8c683c177&k=21176 |title=Council OKs average 7.5% bus fare hike |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108065553/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=1977e375-2fa4-47e1-a04c-d4e8c683c177&k=21176 |archivedate=2012-11-08 }}</ref>\n\nOn 18 January 2013, OC Transpo starting the final testing of its [[Presto Card]] deployment as part of the NEXT-ON program. Ten thousand customers were able to order a Presto Card online or pick one up at select OC Transpo transitway stations, activate it, and use it for OC Transpo's final testing of the loadable cards. As of January 2013, over 10,000 Presto cards have been distributed. A limited number of Presto cards were available at [[Baseline Station]] on 22 January 2013, and at [[Fallowfield Station (OC Transpo)|Fallowfield Station]] on 24 January 2013. The final full release date for Presto in [[Ottawa]] was on 18 May 2013.  Cards can be either loaded with cash and used like tickets, or loaded with as a monthly pass, which unlike the photo pass, is usable by family and friends. As of 2017, yearly and monthly photo passes have been discontinued, as they are not accepted at the new fare gates being installed along the Trillium Line.\n\nThe Province is encouraging all Ontario transit systems to adopt Presto, and the OC Transpo installation has been complex, requiring installation of readers at the front doors of all buses and all doors of articulated and double-decker buses, as well as a computer with a Presto fare database on each bus.  The database was originally refreshed every night with updates of the day's Presto fare purchases when the buses return to the garages; this required users to wait up to 24 hours before cash loaded onto their card accounts is recognized by the readers. In 2014, the readers were upgraded to refresh up to 6 times a day using cellular data. There are now new fare gates and ticket vending machines at all O-Train stations. Unlike the TTC and GO Transit facilities, OC Transpo did not launch full Presto ticket machines until November 2017, when all [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line|Line 2]] stations except for [[Bayview station (Ottawa)|Bayview]] featured a new fare gate system. The full machines allow riders to check and reload a card prior to boarding.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, the express fare was abolished, and express routes (now Connexion routes) use the regular fare.\n\n==Para Transpo==\n'''Para Transpo''' is an accessible [[paratransit]] service available to Ottawa patrons who find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the conventional OC Transpo routes. Service is provided directly to the residences of eligible users who book trip appointments with a call centre at least one day in advance.

The agency's bus system has 170 routes and 43 bus rapid transit (BRT) stations on Ottawa's [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]]. These routes also provide service to the downtown core of the neighbouring city of [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]], especially during rush hour. Rush-hour service is also provided to a park and ride lot in the [[Russell, Ontario|Township of Russell]]. OC Transpo also operates ParaTranspo, a door-to-door [[paratransit|accessible bus service]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n{{further|Ottawa Electric Railway}}\nOttawa's first public transportation system began in 1886 with the operation of a [[horsecar]] system.{{sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=28}}  The horse-drawn streetcars travelled back and forth from [[New Edinburgh]] to the [[Chaudi\u00e8re Bridge]].{{sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=28}} The horsecar would remain a staple means of public transportation until 1891 after [[Thomas Ahearn]] founded the [[Ottawa Electric Railway|Ottawa Electric Railway Company]]. This private enterprise eventually provided heated streetcar service covering the downtown core.{{sfn|Wetering|1997|pp=28}} Electricity had been employed in a few places in Ottawa since the first demonstration of the incandescent bulb in 1883 (the earliest were Parliament Hill and [[LeBreton Flats]]).{{sfn|Woods|pp=162}} In May 1885, electric lighting commenced in the city.  In 1885 council contracted [[Hydro Ottawa|Ottawa Electric Light Company]] to install 165 arc lamps on the city's streets.{{sfn|Woods|pp=162}}\n\n===1970s: Formation, early Transitway and first strike===\nTransit in Ottawa was provided by the [[Ottawa Transportation Commission]] until 1973 when transit service in the city and its suburbs was transferred under the auspices of the [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton]]. Its formal name was the '''Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission''', but the service was promoted in both English and French under the '''OC Transpo''' name, whose OC initials are derived from '''O'''ttawa-'''C'''arleton.\n\nIn 1973, OC Transpo introduced the first BRT system in the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The first element of its BRT system was dedicated bus lanes through the city centre, with platformed stops. This was part of what later became the Transitway.\n\nThe 20-day 1979 strike was fought over a wage difference of a nickel and became known as \"the five-cent bus strike\".

The service consists of one north-south line, with major points of interest including [[Carleton University]] and the [[South Keys Shopping Centre]]. In late 2014, this line became known as [[Trillium Line]], or O-Train Line 2, to allow for expansion of the O-Train brand.\n\nThe province of Ontario ordered the amalgamation of the [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton]] and its component municipalities into a single City of Ottawa municipality. When the new local governance took effect in 2001, OC Transpo became a department of the new city.\n\nFollowing amalgamation, a [[bilingual]] [[Backronym#Replacement|replacement backronym]] for \"OC\" was sought, but no suitable candidates have been found. The anachronistic acronym has been kept, instead of the costly task of replacing the decals on all buses, bus stops, bus stations, and promotional material. Thus, \"OC\" is an [[Acronym#Pseudo-acronyms|orphan initialism]].\n\nA new section of the southwest Transitway opened on December 12, 2005, between the [[Nepean Sportsplex]] and Fallowfield Station. The new section runs parallel to [[Woodroffe Avenue (Ottawa)|Woodroffe Avenue]] and was built at a cost of $10 million. The new section has no stations and has replaced service along [[Woodroffe Avenue (Ottawa)|Woodroffe Avenue]] between the Nepean Sportsplex and [[Fallowfield station (OC Transpo)|Fallowfield]]. The Transitway was further expanded south into [[Barrhaven]] with [[Strandherd Station (OC Transpo)|Strandherd]] opened on January 2, 2007. There are also long range plans for other extensions in the [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario|Orleans]] and [[Kanata, Ontario|Kanata]] areas to keep up with more growing communities.\n\nFollowing the [[2006 Ottawa municipal election|2006 municipal election campaign]], [[Larry O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Larry O'Brien]] was elected as mayor and cancelled the light rail expansion project, per a campaign promise. City Council decided to annul the project by a margin of 13\u201311 on December 14, 2006. The proposed northbound expansions from Bayview onward were later revived with the [[Confederation Line]] project, contracted in December 2012.\n\nOC Transpo drivers, dispatchers, and maintenance workers under [[Amalgamated Transit Union]] local 279 went on [[Strike action|strike]] December 10, 2008, at 12:01am.<ref name=\"CBC10Dec2008\">{{cite news | url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/push-to-call-transit-essential-fails-ottawa-bus-strike-continues-1.704166 | publisher=[[CBC News]] | title=Push to call transit 'essential' fails; Ottawa bus strike continues | date=2008-12-10 | accessdate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> The main causes of the strike were disagreements between the City of Ottawa and the union regarding scheduling, payroll and seniority.

Some of the routes that run on the Transitway, including the city's most-used bus routes, are served almost exclusively by articulated buses (e.g., routes 57, 61, 62, and 75). Peak hour connexion routes are served primarily by Double Decker buses. \n[[File:Otrain ottawa alstom coradia lint.jpg|left|thumb|The [[O-Train]] ([[Trillium Line]]) at [[Carleton University]]]]\nIn 2001, a pilot diesel-powered light rail service project, the original [[O-Train]] known today as the [[Trillium Line]], was introduced. The local government announced expansion plans for the light rail to other parts of Ottawa, including a possible link to the [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa International Airport]]. Service to Gatineau would have also been possible, over the nearby [[Prince of Wales Bridge (Canada)|Prince of Wales railway bridge]] over the [[Ottawa River]]. However, on December 14, 2006, [[Ottawa City Council|City Council]] led by Mayor [[Larry O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Larry O'Brien]] cancelled the [[O-Train#North-south light rail expansion project|north-south light rail expansion project]]. A new model of the project, to have a citywide integrated light rail system, was made, with work beginning in 2013 and will be completed in 2023. This new project envisions fully grade separated rapid transit service on the original Transitways from [[Baseline station]] or Moodie dr. in the west to Trim Park and Ride in the east. The gap between the east end west branches of Transitway will be replaced by a new downtown Subway tunnel under Queen and Rideau streets with three underground stations. The O-Train [[Trillium Line]] will be extended to [[Riverside South, Ottawa|Riverside South]] and will include a spur to the [[Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport]], thus creating direct airport to downtown service. As for the suburbs, they will be served by 65&nbsp;km of new Transitways. The first phase of the project, called the [[Confederation Line]] includes 12.5&nbsp;km of rail between [[Tunney's Pasture]] and Blair, including the downtown subway.\n\nFor a number of years, OC Transpo has carried [[Bicycle carrier|bicycle rack]]s on some routes as a part of the \"Rack & Roll\" campaign. These racks carry up to two bicycles at the front of the bus and fold up against the bus when not in use. Although it started only on three routes, this service has been expanded to include routes 12, 61, 85, 88, 94, 95, 97, 99, 101 and 106 with bike racks appearing on other routes from time to time. As well, all D60LF and D60LFR articulated (60-foot long) buses, all [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500]] double-decker buses, and Invero buses 4427\u20134526 (inclusive) have bike racks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes/rack_roll |title=OC Transpo Rack & Roll |publisher=OC Transpo |date=March 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> Traditionally, the racks have been available only between April and October, and there has been much debate over continuing the program throughout the year. However, cyclists may use the racks at any time, on any bus that is equipped with a rack (including routes that don't normally offer them), provided there is room for the cyclist in the bus. The O-Train is bicycle accessible year-round.\n\nThere are four bus depots located throughout the city. The largest and headquarters is located at 1500 [[St. Laurent Boulevard]], with two other smaller but frequently used depots being located at 168 Colonnade Road (Merivale Garage) and the other on Queensview Drive (Pinecrest Garage). A major new maintenance depot which opened its doors in 2010 is located on Industrial Avenue.\n\n==Routes==\n{{Main|OC Transpo routes}}\nOC Transpo has 170 bus routes (as of October 6, 2019)<ref name=routes>{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/routes |title=OC Transpo Routes & Maps |publisher=OC Transpo |date= |accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> that are grouped both by their number and the colour with which they are represented on system maps and on bus stop flags.\n\n==Fleet==\n[[File:Octranspobusinside.JPG|thumb|Inside an OC Transpo bus]]\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, OC Transpo evaluated a double-decker bus on the Transitway and express routes. This bus, an [[Alexander Dennis Enviro500]], can carry nearly 100 passengers. The initial service demonstration ran from June 28 to July 12, 2006, with a further demonstration under winter conditions in February 2007. The City of Ottawa purchased three Alexander Dennis Enviro500 buses and they were delivered in November 2008.  OC Transpo decals were added to the buses in December, but the [[OC Transpo#December 2008 \u2013 February 2009: ATU 279 strike|strike]] delayed the introduction of these buses. The buses started service in February.\n\nIn August 2010, OC Transpo took advantage of an offer by [[New Flyer Industries]], replacing 226 of its older underpowered 60-foot [[New Flyer Low Floor|D60LF]] articulated buses (purchased between 2001 and 2004) with brand new D60LFR models. The bus exchange was completed in March 2011.  OC Transpo also received other incentives as part of the deal, including rebates on the trading-in of the old buses and a credit on new parts. Eighty new D60LFR articulated buses were also purchased from New Flyer, bringing the combined total to 306 buses.<ref name=\"ottawacitizen.com\">[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Fast+track+deal+approved+council/2963744/story.html Ottawa Citizen story on new articulated bus purchase] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504173014/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Fast+track+deal+approved+council/2963744/story.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.80 |title=New Flyer story on new articulated bus purchase |publisher=Newflyer.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306120047/http://newflyer.com/index/news-app/story.80 |archivedate=2012-03-06 }}</ref> All of the 2001\u20132004 D60LFs are now retired.

These extra double-decker buses are used mainly on connexion routes. Double-decker buses use about the same amount of fuel as an articulated 60-foot bus, but only take up the same road area as a regular 40 foot bus, meaning they free up space (especially downtown), and provide increased seated passenger capacity for longer connexion bus routes, lowering OC Transpo's operating costs. As a result of the purchase, the 60-foot articulated buses were being moved from connexion routes to Transitway and other mainline routes, replacing the 40-foot models currently used on some trips by those routes. Those 40-foot models will replace the older 40-foot models currently used on local routes. The older 40-foot buses were retired from service.<ref>[http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/transit_planning ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308210048/http://www.octranspo.com/about-octranspo/transit_planning |date=March 8, 2011 }}</ref> This plan was approved by the Transit Commission on April 20, 2011. The extra 75 Alexander Dennis E500 double-decker buses entered service between fall 2012 and spring 2013.\n\nThe maintenance of the fleet was complicated by adding buses from another manufacturer (OC Transpo already had buses from New Flyer and Orion before purchasing the double-deckers from Alexander Dennis).

DayPass vouchers were no longer sold since July 1, 2009, leaving only cash and tickets on the bus as a method of payment.\n\nThe '''Family DayPass''' was launched concurrently with the DayPass. At launch, it was available on Sundays and statutory holidays, allowing up to two adults and youth (age 12 or older) to ride the bus with up to four children (age 11 or younger) at the same price of a DayPass. With the discontinuation of DayPass vouchers on July 1, 2009, the Family DayPass was also made available on Saturdays.<ref>{{cite web|author1=OC Transpo|title=New Fares|url=http://www.octranspo.com:80/fares_menue.htm|accessdate=June 22, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930200805/http://www.octranspo.com/fares_menue.htm|archivedate=September 30, 2009|date=July 1, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 2018, OC Transpo launched '''multi-day passes''' (3, 5, or 7 days). This allows multiple days of DayPass service, up to a week, to be purchased in advanced at a lower cost. Multi-day passes cannot be used as a Family DayPass, cannot be loaded on a Presto card and are emitted as a paper transfer.

Train tickets can be exchanged for a bus transfer on board of an OC Transpo bus. O-Train ticket prices increased over time, but remained lower compared to bus cash fares until July 2013, when OC Transpo increased O-Train ticket prices from $2.85 to $3.40 to match the bus cash fare. This represents an increase of over 19% and happened after the Presto card launch completed. This card is accepted at O-Train stations for a lower train fare. Bus tickets and DayPass vouchers cannot be used on the O-Train. Bus transfers, however, are accepted.\n\nMonthly and annual passes are also available for all route classes with cost differences for adults, students, and seniors. Passes require an OC Transpo photo ID card, which is available at extra cost. Additionally, Ecopasses (reduced-rate monthly passes) are available through participating employers in the city, providing applicable OC Transpo riders with single-card indefinite passes in exchange for a flat bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly payroll deduction.\n\nIn July 2008, fares were increased by 7.5% because of a shortage in funding for the [[City of Ottawa]]. This fare hike was supposed to be in effect until 2010 including a 6.5% hike in 2009. This meant Ottawa residents saw regular adult passes rise from $73 a month to $81 and adult express passes from $90 to $101 a month. However, cash fares remained the same.<ref>{{cite web |last=Citizen |first=Ottawa |url=http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=1977e375-2fa4-47e1-a04c-d4e8c683c177&k=21176 |title=Council OKs average 7.5% bus fare hike |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2013-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108065553/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=1977e375-2fa4-47e1-a04c-d4e8c683c177&k=21176 |archivedate=2012-11-08 }}</ref>\n\nOn 18 January 2013, OC Transpo starting the final testing of its [[Presto Card]] deployment as part of the NEXT-ON program. Ten thousand customers were able to order a Presto Card online or pick one up at select OC Transpo transitway stations, activate it, and use it for OC Transpo's final testing of the loadable cards. As of January 2013, over 10,000 Presto cards have been distributed. A limited number of Presto cards were available at [[Baseline Station]] on 22 January 2013, and at [[Fallowfield Station (OC Transpo)|Fallowfield Station]] on 24 January 2013. The final full release date for Presto in [[Ottawa]] was on 18 May 2013.  Cards can be either loaded with cash and used like tickets, or loaded with as a monthly pass, which unlike the photo pass, is usable by family and friends. As of 2017, yearly and monthly photo passes have been discontinued, as they are not accepted at the new fare gates being installed along the Trillium Line.\n\nThe Province is encouraging all Ontario transit systems to adopt Presto, and the OC Transpo installation has been complex, requiring installation of readers at the front doors of all buses and all doors of articulated and double-decker buses, as well as a computer with a Presto fare database on each bus.  The database was originally refreshed every night with updates of the day's Presto fare purchases when the buses return to the garages; this required users to wait up to 24 hours before cash loaded onto their card accounts is recognized by the readers. In 2014, the readers were upgraded to refresh up to 6 times a day using cellular data. There are now new fare gates and ticket vending machines at all O-Train stations. Unlike the TTC and GO Transit facilities, OC Transpo did not launch full Presto ticket machines until November 2017, when all [[O-Train]] [[Trillium Line|Line 2]] stations except for [[Bayview station (Ottawa)|Bayview]] featured a new fare gate system. The full machines allow riders to check and reload a card prior to boarding.\n\nOn January 1, 2017, the express fare was abolished, and express routes (now Connexion routes) use the regular fare.\n\n==Para Transpo==\n'''Para Transpo''' is an accessible [[paratransit]] service available to Ottawa patrons who find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the conventional OC Transpo routes. Service is provided directly to the residences of eligible users who book trip appointments with a call centre at least one day in advance. Para Transpo drivers will provide some assistance to passengers to board designated vehicle and to access building entrances.<ref name=\"Accessible Transit\">{{cite web|url=http://www.octranspo.com/acc_menue.htm |title=Accessible Transit |publisher=Octranspo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-22}}</ref>\n\nPara Transpo operations were contracted to [[First Student Canada]], previously operated by [[Laidlaw]].
