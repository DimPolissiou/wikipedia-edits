It began on November 6, 1984, after California voters passed Proposition 37, the California State Lottery Act of 1984, to authorize the creation of a lottery. The first tickets were sold on October 3, 1985.<ref name=erglunc>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5200%2C805345 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Hollywood-style festivities launch California Lottery |date=October 4, 1985 |page=2E}}</ref>\n\n==Lottery Act==\nThe California State Lottery Act of 1984 was intended to provide more money to schools without imposing extra [[tax]]es. Accordingly, the Lottery was required to provide at least 34% of its revenues to [[public education]], supplementing (not replacing) other funds provided by California. Another 50% of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of [[prize]]s, making a mandated minimum of 84% of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education. The remainder, a maximum of 16%, was to be spent on [[Administration (business)|administration]], such as salaries and running the games.\n\nOn April 8, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB142 Assembly Bill 142] (Hayashi, D-Hayward).<ref>[http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/14853/ 04/08/2010 Legislative Update], Press Releases, Office of the Governor, State of California</ref> Amending the Lottery Act, this bill reallocates Lottery revenues \"so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education.\" As an urgency statute, this bill took effect immediately. The new allocation increased to at least 87% the portion of Lottery revenue returned to the public, and correspondingly decreased to a maximum of 13% the amount spent on administration. It then specified that \"not less than 50% of the total annual Lottery revenues, in an amount to be determined by the commission, be\nreturned to the public in the form of prizes.\" This leaves \"the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the\nbenefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education.\" It also imposed requirements \"to ensure continued growth in Lottery net revenues allocated to public education\", with annual procedures that would, \"in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure, ... provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1, and the prior law to be restored\", if those requirements were not then met.<ref>[http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/AB_142/20092010/ AB 142 (Hayashi): California State Lottery.] AroundTheCapitol.

Rptr. 2d 812, 917 P.2d 651] (1996).</ref> In her opinion for the court, Associate Justice [[Kathryn Werdegar]] explained that the [[California Penal Code]] and case law interpreting the Penal Code have traditionally distinguished between a \"lottery\" and a \"banked game\" or \"banking game,\" and it was the intent of the state electorate in enacting the Lottery Act to allow only a \"lottery.\"<ref name=\"WesternTelcon\" />  In a true \"lottery\", the players play against each other; in a \"banked game\", they play each other ''and'' against the house.<ref name=\"WesternTelcon\" />  The critical distinction between the two is that a bank in a \"banked game\" [[Breaking the bank|can be broken]] based purely upon whether each of the individual bets is won or lost; the house unconditionally promises to pay prizes on all winning bets with no maximum ceiling.<ref name=\"WesternTelcon\" />  The high court explained that while this definition of a lottery does not prohibit fixed-prize lotteries, such lotteries are valid only if the total prize amount and the maximum number of fixed prizes to be won are fixed before the draw.<ref name=\"WesternTelcon\" /> Subsequently, [[California Attorney General]] [[Dan Lungren]] also ruled that Daily 3, which at the time had fixed payouts, also was illegal because it created an interest on the part of the state that fewer people should win, contrary to a lottery where the operator has no stake in the outcome of the draw.<ref>http://oag.ca.gov/system/files/opinions/pdfs/96-1003.pdf</ref> In response to these rulings, the Lottery modified Keno and created Hot Spot, which has a [[Parimutuel_betting | pari-mutue]]l payout format, and modified Daily 3 to a pari-mutuel format where payouts vary depending on the number of individuals who picked the winning numbers.<ref>http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-06/news/mn-41050_1_state-lottery</ref>\n\nCalifornia joined [[Mega Millions]] on June 22, 2005; it became the 12th jurisdiction to offer the game, and the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion with [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL). A Mega Millions drawing was held in [[Hollywood]] to commemorate the event.\n\nIn September 2011, the California Lottery moved into a new $58 million headquarters at 700 North 10th Street across the street from the old one, which it promptly demolished.  Because it was built in a frantic 90-day rush to comply with the Lottery Act, the original headquarters had numerous construction defects in the roof, foundation, and elevator, as well as a mold problem.<ref name=\"Hurt\" />\n\nCalifornia, while initially never desiring to offer Mega Millions's rival [[Powerball]], was briefly a member of the MUSL because an \"international\" lottery game that would have included a number of US lotteries was planned; however, the game never came to fruition. However, in February 2012 the California Lottery initiated an impact analysis of the Powerball game, in preparation for a recommendation in July 2012.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/1104204EB74141CB867C45AD1774A104.ashx</ref> Subsequently, the Fiscal Year 2012\u20132013 Business Plan included funding for a launch of Powerball within the fiscal year,<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/5557D8E2A5BC4355BEC90D983579B158.ashx</ref> with Powerball launching in California on April 8, 2013.

SuperLotto Plus is drawn every Wednesday and Saturday. The game began in 1986 as ''California SuperLotto''. In 2000, the name was changed to SuperLotto Plus. Its starting jackpot is $7 million (annuitized); a [[present value|cash option]] is available for jackpot winners.\n\nWhile the cash option usually is chosen, the SuperLotto Plus annuity is '''graduated'''. As of the May 11, 2013 drawing, the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30-payment graduated annuity stream, similar to that of Mega Millions, partly in response to low long-term interest rates. The cash value is now guaranteed. The graduated payments begin at 1.81% of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56% (more than triple that of the first payment) of the advertised jackpot amount.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/play/draw-games/superlotto-plus/SLP-jackpot-change-advisory</ref><ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/0FC56CB28A7940A78451FCBDA591FF10.pdf</ref> Previously, the first payment was 2.5% of the annuity value (or share) of the jackpot, with the second installment 2.7%. The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 [[percentage point]] yearly, so that the final (26th) installment represented 5.1% of the annuity.\n\n====Hot Spot====\n'''Hot Spot''' is a quick-draw [[keno]] style game. The game was updated on August 1, 2011, to allow players to choose to play any number of \"spots\" from 1 through 10 from a pool of numbers from 01 through 80. A new higher top prize of $100,000 was also offered for 10 spot play. Previously, players could only choose to play 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 spots. Wagering can be either $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, or $20, for a maximum of 100 consecutive draws. In addition, players can choose a Bulls-Eye wager for each draw, hoping to hit the 1 number out of the 20 numbers drawn that is selected as the bulls-eye number. Drawings occur every day and every four minutes from 6:00&nbsp;am until 2:00&nbsp;am. Lottery retailers have monitors that display Hot Spot drawings and recent results from other Lottery games.<ref>[http://www.calottery.com/games/gamespecifics/drawtimes Draw Times & Dates] California State Lottery. Retrieved 2011-04-04.</ref> Fixed prizes are awarded. To meet the pari-mutuel requirements, a continuous \"wagered prize fund\" is created from 63% of gross sales, which ensures that the fixed payouts are met under normal circumstances, and calls for reductions should an unusually large number of individuals win a particular prize. If the wagered prize fund exceeds $2.9 million, prize augmentation and promotions are created to distribute the excess funds.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/B7C34ADC7ACE4997BC0DA17D48B6757E.pdf</ref>\n\n===Multi-jurisdictional games===\n\n====Mega Millions====\n{{main|Mega Millions}}\nIn 2004, Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], as part of his redesign of California government, suggested that California join a multi-jurisdictional lottery. In June 2005, the Lottery Commission voted to join [[Mega Millions]].<ref name=californiachronicle>[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/59631 Tran Bill Signed by Governor to Keep Education Dollars Flowing from State Lottery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312060200/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/59631 |date=2012-03-12 }} California Chronicle, April 23, 2008. Retrieved 2011-04-04.</ref>\n\nCalifornia is unique among the 45 Mega Millions participants in that all nine prize levels for Mega Millions within its borders are always [[parimutuel]], rather than each non-jackpot prize having a set value. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. For example, the \"advertised\" second prize in Mega Millions is $1,000,000; it is not unheard of for that prize level to pay over $1.9 million to a California second-prize winner.<ref>http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/numbers-drawn-for-400m-mega-millions-jackpot/</ref> The second prize pool within California frequently rolls; it is, in effect, a \"secondary jackpot\". Unlike the other Mega Millions members, California currently does not offer the ''Megaplier'', which is drawn in Texas by a [[random number generator]]. It costs $2 per play as of Tuesday October 31st, 2017 because their starting jackpot starts at $40 million dollars when someone hits their jackpot. Starting on Tuesday April 7, 2020, if someone hits this jackpot at anytime (regardless where is it at), then the Mega Millions jackpot will reset to $20 million dollars in next draw! If nobody wins the jackpot after the jackpot has reset to $20 million dollars, then the next estimated Mega Millions jackpot will be determined by sales from the last draw in California and all other areas combined! Then they'll announced the jackpot and winning numbers for the next draw!\n\n====Powerball====\n{{main|Powerball}}\nIn February 2012, as a response to declining sales and low per-capita revenue from the lottery, California Lottery management initiated a review of whether Powerball would be appropriate for the state.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1104204EB74141CB867C45AD1774A104.ashx</ref> In September 2012, the Lottery Commission approved management's request to launch Powerball in April 2013, citing a net increase in revenue of $90 to $120 million as a result of Powerball, desiring to avoid the launch of a $20 scratcher in fall 2013. Since the Lottery Act requires that Lottery staff be present at all draws, two part-time employees audit the Powerball draws, which are held at a studio in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/D94ED4631920443695B3FA2C884CDE58.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, California promulgated the regulations for Powerball in the state. Similar to Mega Millions, all non jackpot draws in the state are within an intrastate pool, with California sending its jackpot share (30% of draw sales) to MUSL for addition to the multi-state jackpot pool. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. Each pool for a particular prize category will rollover, thus the \"pick 5\" prize will create a secondary jackpot similar to the \"pick 5\" payout in California's implementation of Mega Millions. Also, as a result of the California Supreme Court ruling which mandates pari-mutuel payouts, California will not participate in the ''PowerPlay'' multiplier option.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1B46A261DC554507859EAFC41C71DC69.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.10news.com/money/consumer/powerball-tickets-go-on-sale-in-califonia-for-first-time-statewide04082013</ref> California launched Powerball on April 8, 2013, with the first drawing on April 10, 2013.

The top prize was fixed at $3 million; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750. While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009, winners who would previously have spun the wheel on ''The Big Spin'' had the option to spin the wheel\u2014untelevised\u2014as an alternative to going to the ''Make Me a Millionaire'' show, which succeeded ''The Big Spin''. Following the show's ending in 2009, the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage, and decided to preserve ''The Big Spin'' wheel as part of a permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento. Guests are invited to spin the wheel for fun without cash prizes.\n\n====Make Me a Millionaire====\n''[[Make Me a Millionaire]]'', the California Lottery's second TV game show, debuted on January 17, 2009, for an initial four-year run with host [[Mark Walberg|Mark L.

Prizes of $600 or more must be collected from the Lottery, via claim form.<ref name=claim/>\n\n===Claim period===\nAlmost all prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw or the announced end of the game. If the 180th day is a weekend or holiday, the final claim date is extended to the next business day. Any unclaimed prize money is transferred to the education fund in addition to the minimum 34% that the Lottery is already obligated to transfer from income.\n\nBecause many of the 44 Mega Millions participants have a one-year claim period, the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act. On April 23, 2008, Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed Assembly Member [[Van Tran]]'s Assembly Bill 1251, modifying California Government Code section 8880.321 to allow for a one-year claim period for a Mega Millions jackpot prize.<ref name=californiachronicle/><ref>[ftp://leginfo.public.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1251-1300/ab_1251_bill_20080423_chaptered.pdf Assembly Bill No. 1251] Official California Legislative Information, the Legislative Counsel of California.

Merchandise prizes over $5,000 are subject to 33% Federal withholding. Scratchers tickets are generally one-payment prizes; however, some games have annuity options for payments each year, or per week. California does not tax California Lottery winnings, however it taxes lottery winnings from other jurisdictions.<ref>[https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2018/18_540cains.pdf Instructions for Schedule CA (540)], Page 5, Line 21, State of California Franchise Tax Board</ref> For SuperLotto Plus and Mega Millions jackpots, the player may choose a single cash payout for a floating percentage of the jackpot, or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]. The SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball payment schedule are on a graduated basis over 30 annual payments. Until 2005, when California joined Mega Millions, the payment choice on SuperLotto Plus had to be made when the ticket was bought. Since then, there is a 60-day window after winning, in which the choice of cash or annuity is to be made.\n\n==Unclaimed prizes==\nUnclaimed prizes remaining after the claim period expires always go to supporting California\u2019s public schools.

Accordingly, the Lottery was required to provide at least 34% of its revenues to [[public education]], supplementing (not replacing) other funds provided by California. Another 50% of its revenues must be paid to the public in the form of [[prize]]s, making a mandated minimum of 84% of all funds that must be given back to the public in the form of prizes or funds for public education. The remainder, a maximum of 16%, was to be spent on [[Administration (business)|administration]], such as salaries and running the games.\n\nOn April 8, 2010, Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB142 Assembly Bill 142] (Hayashi, D-Hayward).<ref>[http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/14853/ 04/08/2010 Legislative Update], Press Releases, Office of the Governor, State of California</ref> Amending the Lottery Act, this bill reallocates Lottery revenues \"so as to maximize the amount of funding allocated to public education.\" As an urgency statute, this bill took effect immediately. The new allocation increased to at least 87% the portion of Lottery revenue returned to the public, and correspondingly decreased to a maximum of 13% the amount spent on administration. It then specified that \"not less than 50% of the total annual Lottery revenues, in an amount to be determined by the commission, be\nreturned to the public in the form of prizes.\" This leaves \"the commission to establish the percentage to be allocated to the\nbenefit of public education at a level that maximizes the total net revenues allocated to the benefit of public education.\" It also imposed requirements \"to ensure continued growth in Lottery net revenues allocated to public education\", with annual procedures that would, \"in any one of the first 5 full fiscal years after the enactment of this measure, ... provide for the repeal of the changes made by this measure on the following January 1, and the prior law to be restored\", if those requirements were not then met.<ref>[http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/AB_142/20092010/ AB 142 (Hayashi): California State Lottery.] AroundTheCapitol.

The game costs $2 per play, per draw;  held daily at 6:35pm and televised at 6:59pm.<ref>[https://www.lotterycritic.com/lottery-results/california/daily-derby/ How To Play] Daily Derby, California State Lottery</ref>\n\n====Fantasy 5====\nFantasy 5 players choose five numbers from 1 through 39. A ticket includes up to five sets of numbers; they can be played up to 12 drawings. Games cost $1 per play. Fantasy 5 is drawn evenings at 6:35pm and televised at 6:59pm. Jackpots begin at $65,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nA player who bought a $5 Fantasy 5 ticket used to get a coupon to mail in for a \"second-chance\" drawing to be on the ''Make Me a Millionaire'' show, or to play the Dream Machine on the first TV show, ''[[The Big Spin]]''. That drawing was cancelled in July 2010 and now players receive a \"second-chance\" coupon with a twenty digit code. Players can enter those codes at www.calottery.com/fan5 to be entered into a weekly drawing for a cash prize ranging from $1,000 to $10,000.<ref name=FAQ>[http://www.calottery.com/Games/BigSpin/MMAM/ ''Make Me a Millionaire''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218171625/http://www.calottery.com/Games/BigSpin/MMAM/ |date=2008-12-18 }}, California State Lottery</ref>\n\n====SuperLotto Plus====\nSuperLotto Plus is a lotto game played in the style of Mega Millions. SuperLotto Plus is drawn every Wednesday and Saturday. The game began in 1986 as ''California SuperLotto''. In 2000, the name was changed to SuperLotto Plus. Its starting jackpot is $7 million (annuitized); a [[present value|cash option]] is available for jackpot winners.\n\nWhile the cash option usually is chosen, the SuperLotto Plus annuity is '''graduated'''. As of the May 11, 2013 drawing, the advertised annuity jackpot represents a 30-payment graduated annuity stream, similar to that of Mega Millions, partly in response to low long-term interest rates. The cash value is now guaranteed. The graduated payments begin at 1.81% of the jackpot amount and rise exponentially such that the final payout is 5.56% (more than triple that of the first payment) of the advertised jackpot amount.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/play/draw-games/superlotto-plus/SLP-jackpot-change-advisory</ref><ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/0FC56CB28A7940A78451FCBDA591FF10.pdf</ref> Previously, the first payment was 2.5% of the annuity value (or share) of the jackpot, with the second installment 2.7%. The remaining 24 payments increased by 0.1 [[percentage point]] yearly, so that the final (26th) installment represented 5.1% of the annuity.\n\n====Hot Spot====\n'''Hot Spot''' is a quick-draw [[keno]] style game. The game was updated on August 1, 2011, to allow players to choose to play any number of \"spots\" from 1 through 10 from a pool of numbers from 01 through 80. A new higher top prize of $100,000 was also offered for 10 spot play. Previously, players could only choose to play 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 spots. Wagering can be either $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $10, or $20, for a maximum of 100 consecutive draws. In addition, players can choose a Bulls-Eye wager for each draw, hoping to hit the 1 number out of the 20 numbers drawn that is selected as the bulls-eye number. Drawings occur every day and every four minutes from 6:00&nbsp;am until 2:00&nbsp;am. Lottery retailers have monitors that display Hot Spot drawings and recent results from other Lottery games.<ref>[http://www.calottery.com/games/gamespecifics/drawtimes Draw Times & Dates] California State Lottery. Retrieved 2011-04-04.</ref> Fixed prizes are awarded. To meet the pari-mutuel requirements, a continuous \"wagered prize fund\" is created from 63% of gross sales, which ensures that the fixed payouts are met under normal circumstances, and calls for reductions should an unusually large number of individuals win a particular prize. If the wagered prize fund exceeds $2.9 million, prize augmentation and promotions are created to distribute the excess funds.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/commission-schedule/~/media/B7C34ADC7ACE4997BC0DA17D48B6757E.pdf</ref>\n\n===Multi-jurisdictional games===\n\n====Mega Millions====\n{{main|Mega Millions}}\nIn 2004, Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], as part of his redesign of California government, suggested that California join a multi-jurisdictional lottery. In June 2005, the Lottery Commission voted to join [[Mega Millions]].<ref name=californiachronicle>[http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/59631 Tran Bill Signed by Governor to Keep Education Dollars Flowing from State Lottery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312060200/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/59631 |date=2012-03-12 }} California Chronicle, April 23, 2008. Retrieved 2011-04-04.</ref>\n\nCalifornia is unique among the 45 Mega Millions participants in that all nine prize levels for Mega Millions within its borders are always [[parimutuel]], rather than each non-jackpot prize having a set value. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. For example, the \"advertised\" second prize in Mega Millions is $1,000,000; it is not unheard of for that prize level to pay over $1.9 million to a California second-prize winner.<ref>http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/numbers-drawn-for-400m-mega-millions-jackpot/</ref> The second prize pool within California frequently rolls; it is, in effect, a \"secondary jackpot\". Unlike the other Mega Millions members, California currently does not offer the ''Megaplier'', which is drawn in Texas by a [[random number generator]]. It costs $2 per play as of Tuesday October 31st, 2017 because their starting jackpot starts at $40 million dollars when someone hits their jackpot. As of Tuesday April 7th, 2020, if someone hits this jackpot at anytime (regardless where is it at), then the Mega Millions jackpot will reset to $20 million dollars in next draw! If nobody wins the jackpot after the jackpot has reset to $20 million dollars, then the next estimated Mega Millions jackpot will be determined by sales from the last draw in all other areas! Then they'll announced the jackpot and winning numbers for the next draw!\n\n====Powerball====\n{{main|Powerball}}\nIn February 2012, as a response to declining sales and low per-capita revenue from the lottery, California Lottery management initiated a review of whether Powerball would be appropriate for the state.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1104204EB74141CB867C45AD1774A104.ashx</ref> In September 2012, the Lottery Commission approved management's request to launch Powerball in April 2013, citing a net increase in revenue of $90 to $120 million as a result of Powerball, desiring to avoid the launch of a $20 scratcher in fall 2013. Since the Lottery Act requires that Lottery staff be present at all draws, two part-time employees audit the Powerball draws, which are held at a studio in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/D94ED4631920443695B3FA2C884CDE58.pdf</ref>\n\nIn November 2012, California promulgated the regulations for Powerball in the state. Similar to Mega Millions, all non jackpot draws in the state are within an intrastate pool, with California sending its jackpot share (30% of draw sales) to MUSL for addition to the multi-state jackpot pool. This leads to different prize amounts for equivalent winners sold in California when compared to those sold in the other 44 jurisdictions. Each pool for a particular prize category will rollover, thus the \"pick 5\" prize will create a secondary jackpot similar to the \"pick 5\" payout in California's implementation of Mega Millions. Also, as a result of the California Supreme Court ruling which mandates pari-mutuel payouts, California will not participate in the ''PowerPlay'' multiplier option.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2012-meetings/~/media/1B46A261DC554507859EAFC41C71DC69.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.10news.com/money/consumer/powerball-tickets-go-on-sale-in-califonia-for-first-time-statewide04082013</ref> California launched Powerball on April 8, 2013, with the first drawing on April 10, 2013. The marketing budget was $8.4 million, and included experiential \"red balls\" placed at various locations within the state and television, radio, and online advertising. Since someone hit a $190 million dollar Powerball Jackpot in New Jersey on Wednesday April 8, 2020, the Powerball Jackpot had to reset to $20 million dollars, it will rise at least $2 million dollars or more, and it will depend on sales from California and/or the other areas combined!<ref>http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-powerball-generates-excitement-but-will-it-bring-california-cash-20130408,0,5555180.story</ref>\n\n==Former games==\n\n===Draw games===\n'''Little Lotto''': A pick 6-out-of-39 game with a fixed top prize of $500,000.\n\n'''Decco''': Played in a similar fashion as most US \"pick-4\" drawing games, except players had to match one playing card (2 through Ace) in each of the four suits.\n\n'''Topper''': Each SuperLotto Plus ticket automatically was printed with the names of three of California's 100 then-most-populous-cities (e.g. Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento). If the player wagered an additional $1, they were eligible to win up to $25,000 in the ''Topper'' drawing, which was drawn by [[random number generator]].\n\n===Raffle===\n\nThe California Lottery offered two raffles; March 17, 2007<ref>http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local&id=5003754</ref> and one on January 1, 2008.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/media/press-releases/press-release?Item=%7BFB15673A-7C55-4F8D-B9E0-59CE2BA3B22B%7D</ref> The raffles offered the best chance to win a $1 million prize, as well as various smaller prizes, and were designed to respond to lottery players' complaints that many million dollar prizes be offered instead of a few larger prizes. However, the raffles did not sell out, and were not repeated.<ref>http://www.calottery.com/about-us/lottery-commission/meetings-archive/2007-meetings/~/media/B5589136A85B42B6831E2271A1966CD9.ashx</ref>\n\n===TV game shows===\nThe California Lottery has had two TV [[game show]]s.\n\n====The Big Spin====\n''[[The Big Spin]]'', the California Lottery's first game show, broadcast its final episode on January 10, 2009, ending its run as the longest-running lottery game show in the US.<ref name=3Ball/> The Lottery had several methods for choosing contestants, including prizes in Scratchers games and \"second-chance\" drawings from other games. The top prize was fixed at $3 million; the minimum guaranteed prize was $1,750. While Big Spin Scratchers remained in circulation in 2009, winners who would previously have spun the wheel on ''The Big Spin'' had the option to spin the wheel\u2014untelevised\u2014as an alternative to going to the ''Make Me a Millionaire'' show, which succeeded ''The Big Spin''. Following the show's ending in 2009, the California Lottery commission deemed the wheel to be too historic to salvage, and decided to preserve ''The Big Spin'' wheel as part of a permanent exhibit at their headquarters in Sacramento. Guests are invited to spin the wheel for fun without cash prizes.\n\n====Make Me a Millionaire====\n''[[Make Me a Millionaire]]'', the California Lottery's second TV game show, debuted on January 17, 2009, for an initial four-year run with host [[Mark Walberg|Mark L. Walberg]] and co-presenter Liz Hernandez.<ref name=3Ball>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i41ac0111ebdf30101b1b324632eefb93 \"3 Ball takes chance on lottery game show\"] ''The Hollywood Reporter'', Nielsen Business Media, Inc., January 7, 2009.</ref> On May 4, 2010, the California Lottery announced the show's cancellation due to poor ratings, with the last program telecast on July 3, 2010.

The first game, Lucky Penny, gave three players a minimum prize of $2,000 and the possibility of winning a car. The second game is Safe Cracker, in which two players competed for prizes ranging from $2,000 to $92,000. Next is California Cool, with one player and prizes ranging from $5,000 to $200,000. The last game is Millionaire, also for one player; it guaranteed $10,000 with a jackpot that began at $1 million, increasing by $200,000 each week until won.<ref name=Dec3/>\n\n==Scratchers==\nCalifornia sells [[scratch card]]s under the branding \"Scratchers\". The prizes are smaller than other lottery games, but there are better odds (averaging 1:5). There are dozens of Scratchers games on sale at any time, and the selection of games changes frequently. Winners must be claimed within 180 days of the announced end-of-game date.<ref name=claim>[http://www.calottery.com/Games/GameSpecifics/ClaimingPrizes/ Claiming Prizes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226071026/http://www.calottery.com/games/gamespecifics/claimingprizes |date=2008-12-26 }}, California State Lottery</ref><ref>[http://www.calottery.com/Games/Scratchers/EndofGameInfo/ End of Game Information], California State Lottery</ref> Scratchers range in price from $1 to $30. A $20 scratcher, \"$5 Million Jackpot\", was introduced September 25, 2013. To commemorate the Lottery's 30th anniversary, on August 24th, 2015, a $30 Scratcher \"California Lottery 30th Anniversary\" was launched.\n\n==Claiming prizes==\nFor each prize of less than $600, players may collect from either a Lottery retailer or the Lottery itself. Prizes of $600 or more must be collected from the Lottery, via claim form.<ref name=claim/>\n\n===Claim period===\nAlmost all prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the draw or the announced end of the game. If the 180th day is a weekend or holiday, the final claim date is extended to the next business day. Any unclaimed prize money is transferred to the education fund in addition to the minimum 34% that the Lottery is already obligated to transfer from income.\n\nBecause many of the 44 Mega Millions participants have a one-year claim period, the California legislature changed the language in the Lottery Act. On April 23, 2008, Gov. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed Assembly Member [[Van Tran]]'s Assembly Bill 1251, modifying California Government Code section 8880.321 to allow for a one-year claim period for a Mega Millions jackpot prize.<ref name=californiachronicle/><ref>[ftp://leginfo.public.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1251-1300/ab_1251_bill_20080423_chaptered.pdf Assembly Bill No. 1251] Official California Legislative Information, the Legislative Counsel of California. Retrieved 2011-04-04.</ref> This is the only prize in California that has a one-year claim period. All other prizes have the 180-day claim period. This legislation affected Mega Millions drawings after July 5, 2008.\n\n===Payment options===\nAll prizes for Fantasy 5, Daily Derby, Daily 3, Daily 4, and '''non-jackpot''' SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball prizes, are paid out in one payment, less 24% '''or''' 33% (depending upon the winner's tax documentation) Federal withholding if the prize is over $5,000. Merchandise prizes over $5,000 are subject to 33% Federal withholding. Scratchers tickets are generally one-payment prizes; however, some games have annuity options for payments each year, or per week. California does not tax California Lottery winnings, however it taxes lottery winnings from other jurisdictions.<ref>[https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2018/18_540cains.pdf Instructions for Schedule CA (540)], Page 5, Line 21, State of California Franchise Tax Board</ref> For SuperLotto Plus and Mega Millions jackpots, the player may choose a single cash payout for a floating percentage of the jackpot, or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]. The SuperLotto Plus, Mega Millions, and Powerball payment schedule are on a graduated basis over 30 annual payments. Until 2005, when California joined Mega Millions, the payment choice on SuperLotto Plus had to be made when the ticket was bought. Since then, there is a 60-day window after winning, in which the choice of cash or annuity is to be made.\n\n==Unclaimed prizes==\nUnclaimed prizes remaining after the claim period expires always go to supporting California\u2019s public schools. As of the end of FY 2013\u201314, a total of $793.5 million in unclaimed prizes have been awarded to education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calottery.com/sitecore/content/ARCHIVE/media/fact-sheets/unclaimed-prizes}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gambling in California]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.calottery.com/ California State Lottery] Official Site\n*[https://www.superlotto-plus.com/ Superlotto Plus Results and News] Superlotto Plus Results\n\n{{U.S. lotteries}}\n\n[[Category:State lotteries of the United States]]\n[[Category:Economy of California]]\n[[Category:1984 establishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "Tlc6just", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMega Millions", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Lottery"}

He wrestled in El Dorado debut show on April 24, 2006, teaming with Ishimori and [[Jumping Kid Okimoto]] in a losing effort against Aagan Iisou and their new member [[Kenichi Sakai|Pineapple Hanai]], later known as Ken45\u00ba. He got his revenge in El Dorado's first big show, teaming up with [[Takuya Sugi|El Blazer]] and Milanito Collection a.t. to defeat Kondo, Yasshi and Ken45\u00ba after a miscommunication among those. In late 2006, Ibushi teamed with [[Milano Collection AT]] to take part in Treasure Hunters Tag Tournament and reached the finals before being knocked out by [[Dick Togo]] and [[Shuji Kondo]]. Ibushi and [[KAGETORA (wrestler)|Kagetora]] won a number one condership match for the [[UWA World Tag Team Championship]] and went on to win the championships by defeating [[Tokyo Gurentai]] ([[Kazuhiko Masada|Mazada]] and [[Kazushige Nosawa|Nosawa Rongai]]) and would later vacate the championships due to inactivity. Ibushi gained a total of four points in Greatest Golden League 2008 which was not enough to progress out of block A and to the semi final.\n\n=== New Japan Pro-Wrestling ===\n====IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion (2009\u20132014)====\nIn May and June 2009 Ibushi participated in the Best of the Super Juniors Tournament held by NJPW.
