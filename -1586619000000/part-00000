Kyoko, the daughter of a preacher, is a [[magical girl]] from a poor family. Initially depicted as an antagonist, she is aggressive and clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]] over their ideals of justice. As the series progresses, however, her views change and she tries to help Sayaka. Kyoko's past and her relationship with [[Mami Tomoe]] have been explored in the manga spin-off, ''The Different Story''. She has appeared in several ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''-related media, including [[manga]], novels and [[video game]]s.\n\nSeries writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] originally created Kyoko as a [[Foil (fiction)|foil]] to Sayaka Miki; although both characters make similar wishes and experience similar situations, they develop different personalities. Kyoko was designed by [[Ume Aoki]]; Takahiro Kishida adapted Aoki's original design and added a number of features to the character. She is voiced by [[Ai Nonaka]] in the Japanese version, and [[Lauren Landa]] voices her in the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|English version]]. \n\nCritical response to Kyoko has been favorable, with critics calling her character interesting and praising her backstory. Her clash with (and similarity to) Sayaka has been singled out. The character has placed well in several popularity polls, and Kyoko merchandise such as [[Figurine|figures]], [[plush doll]]s and [[keychain]]s has been released.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nKyoko is a [[loner]] [[magical girl]] from the city of Kazamino.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep4&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Miracles and Magic Are Real|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS &amp; TBS|airdate=January 28, 2011|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a long red [[ponytail]], fangs and a voracious appetite; she is rarely seen without food.&lt;ref name=&quot;page38&quot;/&gt; Kyoko is the daughter of a [[preacher]] who was excommunicated for [[heresy]]. She and her family nearly starve to death after her father's [[excommunication]], which forces her to steal food so they can all survive. Kyoko makes a pact with [[Kyubey]], a messenger of magic, to obtain more followers for her father. Her father goes insane when he learns this, killing the rest of the family and himself; he torments Kyoko, the sole survivor, from beyond the grave. She decides to use her magic only for herself, since using it for others causes pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep8&quot;/&gt;\n\nKyoko has been a magical girl longer than the other girls, and is more skillful. She uses a spear which can extend itself, split into several sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain which can constrict and hit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=There's No Way I'll Ever Regret It|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS &amp; TBS|airdate=February 4, 2011|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyoko can also erect barriers, to protect others or keep them from interfering.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep8&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Creation and design==\nKyoko was created by writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] and director [[Akiyuki Shinbo]], and designed by [[Ume Aoki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;megami&quot;/&gt; Urobuchi created the character as a foil to [[Sayaka Miki]]. Both make similar wishes: wishing for someone else, while fighting for justice. When their wishes go wrong, they develop different personalities; Kyoko abandons her ideals of justice and begins fighting for herself, while Sayaka refuses to abandon her ideals and slowly despairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;vol20&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adult Anime Vol.20|page=32|isbn=978-4862487117|publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Yosensha|ja|3=\u6d0b\u6cc9\u793e}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urobuchi noted that Kyoko sees herself in Sayaka.

Another difficulty was the &quot;chomping noises&quot; when Kyoko eats, but &quot;that way I can add a little bit more viciousness to it so it's kind of fun that way&quot;.

Kyoko then decides to use her magic only for herself. She initially clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]], trying to kill her due to their different ideals of justice. Kyoko learns that her soul is not attached to her body, but is in her soul gem (the source of their magic).

She is friendlier to Sayaka, and lives in her house. It was revealed that Homura was a witch and created a barrier in her soul gem (with Mitakahira City Homura's idealized world); the Nightmares were created by the barrier so the magical girls can fight, and Kyoko and the other magical girls who were pulled inside the barrier were implanted with false memories. They save Homura by destroying her barrier; she steals Ultimate Madoka's powers and rewrites the universe before proclaiming herself as the devil. Homura gives everyone happy lives in her new world, however, and Kyoko and Sayaka are friends.\n\n===&lt;span id=&quot;In other media&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Other media===\nIn addition to the main series, Kyoko appears in several manga related to ''Madoka Magica''.

Kyoko, the daughter of a preacher, is a [[magical girl]] from a poor family. Initially depicted as an antagonist, she is aggressive and clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]] over their ideals of justice. As the series progresses, however, her views change and she tries to help Sayaka. Kyoko's past and her relationship with [[Mami Tomoe]] have been explored in the manga spin-off, ''The Different Story''. She has appeared in several ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''-related media, including [[manga]], novels and [[video game]]s.\n\nSeries writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] originally created Kyoko as a [[Foil (fiction)|foil]] to Sayaka Miki; although both characters make similar wishes and experience similar situations, they develop different personalities. Kyoko was designed by [[Ume Aoki]]; Takahiro Kishida adapted Aoki's original design and added a number of features to the character. She is voiced by [[Ai Nonaka]] in the Japanese version, and [[Lauren Landa]] voices her in the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|English version]]. \n\nCritical response to Kyoko has been favorable, with critics calling her character interesting and praising her backstory. Her clash with (and similarity to) Sayaka has been singled out. The character has placed well in several popularity polls, and Kyoko merchandise such as [[Figurine|figures]], [[plush doll]]s and [[keychain]]s has been released.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nKyoko is a [[loner]] [[magical girl]] from the city of Kazamino.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep4&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Miracles and Magic Are Real|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS &amp; TBS|airdate=January 28, 2011|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a long red [[ponytail]], fangs and a voracious appetite; she is rarely seen without food.&lt;ref name=&quot;page38&quot;/&gt; Kyoko is the daughter of a [[preacher]] who was excommunicated for [[heresy]]. She and her family nearly starve to death after her father's [[excommunication]], which forces her to steal food so they can all survive. Kyoko makes a pact with [[Kyubey]], a messenger of magic, to obtain more followers for her father. Her father goes insane when he learns this, killing the rest of the family and himself; he torments Kyoko, the sole survivor, from beyond the grave. She decides to use her magic only for herself, since using it for others causes pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep8&quot;/&gt;\n\nKyoko has been a magical girl longer than the other girls, and is more skillful. She uses a spear which can extend itself, split into several sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain which can constrict and hit others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=There's No Way I'll Ever Regret It|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS &amp; TBS|airdate=February 4, 2011|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyoko can also erect barriers, to protect others or keep them from interfering.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep8&quot;/&gt;\n\n==Creation and design==\nKyoko was created by writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] and director [[Akiyuki Shinbo]], and designed by [[Ume Aoki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;megami&quot;/&gt; Urobuchi created the character as a foil to [[Sayaka Miki]]. Both make similar wishes: wishing for someone else, while fighting for justice. When their wishes go wrong, they develop different personalities; Kyoko abandons her ideals of justice and begins fighting for herself, while Sayaka refuses to abandon her ideals and slowly despairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;vol20&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adult Anime Vol.20|page=32|isbn=978-4862487117|publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Yosensha|ja|3=\u6d0b\u6cc9\u793e}}|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urobuchi noted that Kyoko sees herself in Sayaka.

Another difficulty was the &quot;chomping noises&quot; when Kyoko eats, but &quot;that way I can add a little bit more viciousness to it so it's kind of fun that way&quot;. Landa said that she enjoyed Kyoko's &quot;badass&quot; persona; the actress &quot;absolutely fell in love with Kyoko&quot;, and had a &quot;blast&quot; working with the cast members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9eW0IDrQ0Y|title=Madoka Magica English Cast Video: Kyoko Sakura|author=[[Aniplex of America]]|date=February 10, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 25, 2020|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===&lt;span id=&quot;In ''Madoka Magica''&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;''Madoka Magica''===\nKyoko is an experienced magical girl who comes to the city of Mitakihara after [[Mami Tomoe]]'s death.&lt;ref name=&quot;ep4&quot;/&gt; From a poor religious family, she wished that people would listen to her father's preaching; when her father learned about this, however, he went mad and killed everyone in his family except her.

It was revealed that Homura was a witch and created a barrier in her soul gem (with Mitakahira City Homura's idealized world); the Nightmares were created by the barrier so the magical girls can fight, and Kyoko and the other magical girls who were pulled inside the barrier were implanted with false memories. They save Homura by destroying her barrier; she steals Ultimate Madoka's powers and rewrites the universe before proclaiming herself as the devil.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms.

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nBy 1783, two more touns had been established on land belonging to Pitmiddle, effectively  depriving Pitmiddle of most of its farmland. These were Newtown (now Outfield) and Bank (now Guardswell).<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt its demise. Young people were leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield.

These powers come at the cost of Rukia's own, and as a result, Ichigo concedes to work as Rukia's stand-in, fighting to protect people from evil spirits called [[List of Bleach characters#Secondary characters|Hollows]] and sending good spirits, [[Bleach (manga)#Character types|wholes]], to a dimension known as the [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|Soul Society]]. In addition to the manga series, Ichigo appears in many other pieces of ''Bleach'' media, including the [[Bleach (anime)|anime]] series, the four featured films, the two [[original video animation]]s, [[Rock opera|rock musicals]], several [[List of Bleach video games|video games]], [[light novel]]s and the [[Bleach (2018 film)|2018 live-action film]].\n\nKubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role.

He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in ''Bleach''.<ref name=\"Popularity2\"/> The 2007 Japanese ''[[Newtype]]'' magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters.

He is the main protagonist of the series, who receives [[Soul Reaper (Bleach)|Soul Reaper]] powers after befriending [[Rukia Kuchiki]], the Soul Reaper assigned to patrol around the fictional city of Karakura Town. These powers come at the cost of Rukia's own, and as a result, Ichigo concedes to work as Rukia's stand-in, fighting to protect people from evil spirits called [[List of Bleach characters#Secondary characters|Hollows]] and sending good spirits, [[Bleach (manga)#Character types|wholes]], to a dimension known as the [[Bleach (manga)#Plot|Soul Society]]. In addition to the manga series, Ichigo appears in many other pieces of ''Bleach'' media, including the [[Bleach (anime)|anime]] series, the four featured films, the two [[original video animation]]s, [[Rock opera|rock musicals]], several [[List of Bleach video games|video games]], [[light novel]]s and the [[Bleach (2018 film)|2018 live-action film]].\n\nKubo said that Ichigo was created to replace Rukia as the protagonist of the series because he felt she wasn't suited for the role. His character has been well received among both readers and reviewers. Ichigo is often featured in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' character popularity polls. He was consistently ranked as the most popular character in ''Bleach''.<ref name=\"Popularity2\"/> The 2007 Japanese ''[[Newtype]]'' magazine polls ranked Ichigo as one of the top 100 most-loved anime characters. Reviewers of the series have praised his personality, though some consider him to be a stereotypical [[anti-hero]]. Merchandise based on Ichigo's likeness has been released, including toys, clothing and action figures. In the animated adaptations of ''Bleach'', Ichigo is voiced by [[Masakazu Morita]] in Japanese.<ref name=\"japvoice\">{{cite episode|title=\u6b7b\u795e\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3063\u305f\u65e5|number=1|series=Bleach|credits=TV Tokyo, Dentsu, Studio Pierrot|network=TV Tokyo|airdate=October 5, 2004}}</ref> In the English adaptations, he is voiced by [[Johnny Yong Bosch]].<ref name=\"Engvoice\">{{cite episode|title=A Soul Reaper is Born! |number=1|series=Bleach|credits=TV Tokyo, Dentsu, Studio Pierrot|network=Cartoon Network|airdate=September 8, 2006}}</ref> In the live-action film, he is played by [[Sota Fukushi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/08/18-1/sota-fukushi-to-lead-live-action-bleach-movie|title=Sota Fukushi To Lead Live-Action \"Bleach\" Movie|author=|date=|website=crunchyroll.com}}</ref>\n\n==Creation and conception==\nWhen drawing the manga series, Kubo commented that [[Rukia Kuchiki]], the first ''Bleach'' character he introduced, was originally intended to be the [[protagonist]].

The team that scores more goals on aggregate over the two legs advances to the next round. If the aggregate score is level, the [[away goals rule]] is applied, i.e. the team that scores more goals away from home over the two legs advances. If away goals are also equal, then [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] is not played and the winners are decided by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].

The seeded teams are drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group cannot be drawn against each other, while teams from the same association can be drawn against each other.\n*In the draws for semi-finals, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association can be drawn against each other. As the draws for the quarter-finals and semi-finals are held together before the quarter-finals are played, the identity of the quarter-final winners is not known at the time of the semi-final

She claims to have at least one sister and one brother although neither are ever seen (not even in the occasional flashbacks). She had a sister who died at the age of six.\n\nAlly attended [[Harvard Law School]] with Billy Thomas (played by [[Gil Bellows]]), with whom she had had a relationship since they were eight years old so that she could be with him. Billy, however, left Harvard to attend [[University of Michigan Law School]], thereby breaking Ally's heart. The next thing the audience knows about Ally is that she lives with district attorney Ren\u00e9e Radick, and she is employed in a Boston law firm.\n\nAlly quit the law firm because her boss harassed her and was then recruited by old classmate Richard Fish to join his law firm, Cage & Fish. To her own surprise and horror, she found out that Billy, now married to fellow lawyer (and University of Michigan classmate), Georgia, is working at Cage & Fish. She falls in love with him again, to the horror of Georgia. However, Ally and Georgia become friends and Ally learns to work side by side with Billy.\n\nThroughout the series Ally dated lots of men. Because Billy remained the love of her life, no relationship ever got serious until she met Dr. Greg Butters (played by [[Jesse L. Martin]]). Greg and Ally got quite serious until the two were spotted kissing by Billy. Billy felt so jealous that he imagined himself to be in love with Ally after which he declared his undying love for her. The two subsequently engaged in a short affair, which Ally finally broke off. Nonetheless, Greg broke off the relationship after finding out.\n\nThe third season began with Ally engaging in sex with a guy at a car wash, it later turns out that he is the fianc\u00e9e of a client, whom Ally subsequently tells of the liaison on her wedding day. Later, Billy discovers he has a brain tumor, and grows closer to Ally again. However, before anything can be done about it, Billy dies in Ally's arms in court after giving a passionate closing describing his life (though in reality he is hallucinating and describing the life he wishes he had shared with Ally.) When Georgia later asks Ally if Billy had said anything before he died, she lies to her in order to spare her feelings.\n\nAlly started dating again, finally meeting a British lawyer named Brian Selig (played by [[Tim Dutton]]). The two started dating and ended up having a six-month relationship. When, after six months, Brian asked Ally to move in with him, Ally realized Brian was much too boring for her and then broke off the relationship.\n\nShortly after that, she fell in love with fellow lawyer Larry Paul. They initially met when she walked into his office by mistake, and spent much time talking about her issues before she discovered he was a lawyer and not the therapist with whom she had an appointment.<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION/RADIO; Delivering Something Real To 'Ally McBeal'|work= The New York Times|date=2001-03-18|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/television-radio-delivering-something-real-to-ally-mcbeal.html?scp=16&sq=ally%20mcbeal&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-20 | first=Steve | last=Vineberg}}</ref> The two started a serious but rocky relationship. Although initially troubled by the fact that Larry had an ex-wife with whom he was still close and an ex-girlfriend (played by [[Famke Janssen]]) who was also the mother of his child, it was soon evident that Larry was her soulmate. The two agreed to take the relationship long distance between Detroit and Boston when Larry's son visited and met Ally and told her he missed his dad at home.  Ally then encouraged Larry to move back to Detroit to be in his son's life. Larry agreed and the two parted with the understanding that the relationship would remain and that each would visit the other until such a time that Ally was ready to move to Detroit. He left a note pinned to a snowman outside Ally's door on the evening he left for Detroit that said, \"I will be back.\" (Initially Ally was supposed to marry Larry at the end of season 4. But when actor [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] was arrested on drug-related charges and sent to jail, the network fired Downey, canceling the marriage storyline.)\n\nWhile in college, Ally, in need of money, donated an egg for research, only to find out years later that it wound up getting adopted. One day a little girl (played by [[Hayden Panettiere]]) shows up on her doorstep, claiming to be her daughter, prompting Ally to faint. She gets to know her daughter over the course of several episodes. Her most significant love interest for this final season was Victor Morrison (played by [[Jon Bon Jovi]]) but the relationship deteriorated quite quickly as it was evident that Ally was still in love with Larry. Subsequently, her daughter Madison is harassed by schoolmates and mourns her anonymous father, so Ally accepting her bigger role now is to prioritize her child over her job and quest for love decides to move to her daughter's home city of New York.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}\nOpinion on Ally McBeal was that she was demeaning to women (specifically professional women<ref>Michelle L. Hammers, \"Cautionary Tales of Liberation and Female Professionalism: The Case ''Against Ally McBeal''\" ''Western Journal of Communication'' '''69''' 2, April (2005): 168. \"The ease with which ''McBeal''s depictions of women are reincorporated into dominant masculinist discourses ... is particularly to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, ''McBeal'' operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body.</ref>) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr062598.html|title=Is Feminism Dead?

She claims to have at least one sister and one brother although neither are ever seen (not even in the occasional flashbacks). She had a sister who died at the age of six.\n\nAlly attended [[Harvard Law School]] with Billy Thomas (played by [[Gil Bellows]]), with whom she had had a relationship since they were eight years old so that she could be with him. Billy, however, left Harvard to attend [[University of Michigan Law School]], thereby breaking Ally's heart. The next thing the audience knows about Ally is that she lives with district attorney Ren\u00e9e Radick, and she is employed in a Boston law firm.\n\nAlly quit the law firm because her boss harassed her and was then recruited by old classmate Richard Fish to join his law firm, Cage & Fish. To her own surprise and horror, she found out that Billy, now married to fellow lawyer (and University of Michigan classmate), Georgia, is working at Cage & Fish. She falls in love with him again, to the horror of Georgia. However, Ally and Georgia become friends and Ally learns to work side by side with Billy.\n\nThroughout the series Ally dated lots of men. Because Billy remained the love of her life, no relationship ever got serious until she met Dr. Greg Butters (played by [[Jesse L. Martin]]). Greg and Ally got quite serious until the two were spotted kissing by Billy. Billy felt so jealous that he imagined himself to be in love with Ally after which he declared his undying love for her. The two subsequently engaged in a short affair, which Ally finally broke off. Nonetheless, Greg broke off the relationship after finding out.\n\nThe third season began with Ally engaging in sex with a guy at a car wash, it later turns out that he is the fianc\u00e9e of a client, whom Ally subsequently tells of the liaison on her wedding day. Later, Billy discovers he has a brain tumor, and grows closer to Ally again. However, before anything can be done about it, Billy dies in Ally's arms in court after giving a passionate closing describing his life (though in reality he is hallucinating and describing the life he wishes he had shared with Ally.) When Georgia later asks Ally if Billy had said anything before he died, she lies to her in order to spare her feelings.\n\nAlly started dating again, finally meeting a British lawyer named Brian Selig (played by [[Tim Dutton]]). The two started dating and ended up having a six-month relationship. When, after six months, Brian asked Ally to move in with him, Ally realized Brian was much too boring for her and then broke off the relationship.\n\nShortly after that, she fell in love with fellow lawyer Larry Paul. They initially met when she walked into his office by mistake, and spent much time talking about her issues before she discovered he was a lawyer and not the therapist with whom she had an appointment.<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION/RADIO; Delivering Something Real To 'Ally McBeal'|work= The New York Times|date=2001-03-18|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/television-radio-delivering-something-real-to-ally-mcbeal.html?scp=16&sq=ally%20mcbeal&st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-20 | first=Steve | last=Vineberg}}</ref> The two started a serious but rocky relationship. Although initially troubled by the fact that Larry had an ex-wife with whom he was still close and an ex-girlfriend (played by [[Famke Janssen]]) who was also the mother of his child, it was soon evident that Larry was her soulmate. The two agreed to take the relationship long distance between Detroit and Boston when Larry's son visited and met Ally and told her he missed his dad at home.  Ally then encouraged Larry to move back to Detroit to be in his son's life. Larry agreed and the two parted with the understanding that the relationship would remain and that each would visit the other until such a time that Ally was ready to move to Detroit. He left a note pinned to a snowman outside Ally's door on the evening he left for Detroit that said, \"I will be back.\" (Initially Ally was supposed to get married to Larry at the end of season 4. But when actor [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] was arrested on drug-related charges and sent to jail, the network fired Downey, canceling the marriage storyline.)\n\nWhile in college, Ally, in need of money, donated an egg for research, only to find out years later that it wound up getting adopted. One day a little girl (played by [[Hayden Panettiere]]) shows up on her doorstep, claiming to be her daughter, prompting Ally to faint. She gets to know her daughter over the course of several episodes. Her most significant love interest for this final season was Victor Morrison (played by [[Jon Bon Jovi]]) but the relationship deteriorated quite quickly as it was evident that Ally was still in love with Larry. Subsequently, her daughter Madison is harassed by schoolmates and mourns her anonymous father, so Ally accepting her bigger role now is to prioritize her child over her job and quest for love decides to move to her daughter's home city of New York.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}\nOpinion on Ally McBeal was that she was demeaning to women (specifically professional women<ref>Michelle L. Hammers, \"Cautionary Tales of Liberation and Female Professionalism: The Case ''Against Ally McBeal''\" ''Western Journal of Communication'' '''69''' 2, April (2005): 168. \"The ease with which ''McBeal''s depictions of women are reincorporated into dominant masculinist discourses ... is particularly to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, ''McBeal'' operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body.</ref>) because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, short skirts,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/community/transcripts/chattr062598.html|title=Is Feminism Dead?

{"title_page": "Volume of an n-ball", "text_new": "{{Short description|Generalizing the notion of 3-dimensional volume to regions of points in n-dimensional Euclidean space with distance to a center less than a constant}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Volume of an ''n''-ball}}\n{{hypersphere_volume_and_surface_area_graphs.svg|250px}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''[[ball (mathematics)|ball]]''' is a region in space comprising all points within a fixed distance from a given point; that is, it is the region enclosed by a [[sphere]] or [[hypersphere]]. An {{math|''n''}}-ball is a ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The '''volume of a unit {{math|''n''}}-ball''' is an important expression that occurs in formulas throughout mathematics; it generalizes the notion of the volume enclosed by a sphere in 3-dimensional space.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== The volume ===\nThe {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:<ref>Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.19#E4, Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.</ref>\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n,</math>\nwhere {{math|\u0393}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]].  The gamma function extends the [[factorial]] function to non-integer arguments.  It satisfies {{math|\u0393(''n'') {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 1)!}} if {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and {{math|\u0393(''n'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|1|2}}) \u00b7 (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|3|2}}) \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u03c0<sup>1/2</sup>}} if {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative integer.\n\n=== Alternative forms ===\nUsing explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &= \\frac{\\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}, \\\\\nV_{2k+1}(R) &= \\frac{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \\frac{2(k!)(4\\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\nIn the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!! {{=}} 1 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 (2''k'' \u2212 1) \u00b7 (2''k'' + 1)}}. \n\nInstead of expressing the volume {{math|''V''}} of the ball in terms of its radius {{math|''R''}}, the formula can be [[Inverse function|inverted]] to express the radius as a function of the volume:\n:<math>R_n(V) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)^\\frac{1}{n}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}V^\\frac{1}{n}.</math>\nThis formula, too, can be separated into even- and odd-dimensional cases using factorials and double factorials in place of the gamma function:\n:<math>\\begin{align}R_{2k}(V) &= \\frac{(k!V)^\\frac{1}{2k}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}, \\\\\nR_{2k+1}(V) &= \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)!!V}{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Recursions ===\nThe volume satisfies several recursive formulas. These formulas can either be proved directly or proved as consequences of the general volume formula above. The simplest to state is a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of the same radius:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R).</math>\n\nThere is also a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball of the same radius:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\nUsing explicit formulas for the gamma function again shows that the one-dimension recursion formula can also be written as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_{2k}(R) &= R\\pi \\frac{(2k - 1)!!}{2^k k!} V_{2k-1}(R) = R\\pi \\frac{(2k-1)(2k-3) \\cdots 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}{(2k)(2k - 2) \\cdots 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2} V_{2k-1}(R), \\\\[10px]\nV_{2k+1}(R) &= 2R\\frac{2^k k!}{(2k+1)!!} V_{2k}(R) = 2R\\frac{(2k)(2k - 2) \\cdots 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2}{(2k+1)(2k-1) \\cdots 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1} V_{2k}(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} may be expressed recursively in terms of the radius of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball or an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball.

Then the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} approaches zero as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity. This can be shown using the two-dimension recursion formula. At each step, the new factor being multiplied into the volume is proportional to {{math|1 / ''n''}}, where the constant of proportionality {{math|2\u03c0''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is independent of {{math|''n''}}. Eventually, {{math|''n''}} is so large that the new factor is less than 1. From then on, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball must decrease at least geometrically, and therefore it tends to zero. A variant on this proof uses the one-dimension recursion formula. Here, the new factor is proportional to a quotient of gamma functions. [[Gautschi's inequality]] bounds this quotient above by {{math|''n''<sup>\u22121/2</sup>}}. The argument concludes as before by showing that the volumes decrease at least geometrically.\n\nA more precise description of the high dimensional behavior of the volume can be obtained using [[Stirling's approximation]]. It implies the [[asymptotic formula]]:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\pi}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi e}{n}\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}R^n.</math>\nThe error in this approximation is a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. Stirling's approximation is in fact an underestimate of the gamma function, so the above formula is an upper bound. This provides another proof that the volume of the ball decreases exponentially: When {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, the factor {{math|''R''{{sqrt|2\u03c0''e''/''n''}}}} is less than one, and then the same argument as before applies.\n\nIf instead {{math|''V''}} is fixed while {{math|''n''}} is large, then by Stirling's approximation again, the radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} is approximately\n:<math>R_n(V) \\sim (\\pi n)^{\\frac{1}{2n}}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2\\pi e}}V^{\\frac{1}{n}}.</math>\nThis expression is a lower bound for {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}}, and the error is again a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. As {{math|''n''}} increases, {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}} grows as <math>\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).</math>\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nLet {{math|''A{{sub|n}}''(''R'')}} denote the surface area of the [[n-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]] of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is a union of concentric spheres, and consequently the surface area and the volume are related by:\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{d}{dR}V_{n+1}(R).</math>\nCombining this with the explicit formula for the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball gives\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n + 1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\big(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\big)}R^n.</math>\n\nSince the volume is proportional to a power of the radius, the above relation leads to a simple equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball. By applying the two-dimension recursion formula, it also gives an equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball.  These formulas, together with the volume and surface area of zero-dimensional balls, can be used as a system of recurrence relations for the volumes and surface areas of balls:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_0(R) &= 1, \\\\\nA_0(R) &= 2, \\\\\nV_{n+1}(R) &= \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R), \\\\\nA_{n+1}(R) &= (2\\pi R)V_n(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Dimension maximizing the volume of a fixed-radius ball ===\nSuppose that {{math|''R''}} is a fixed positive real number, and consider the volume {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} as a function of the positive integer {{nowrap|dimension {{math|''n''}}.}} Since the volume of a ball with fixed positive radius tends to zero as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}, the maximum volume is achieved for some value of {{mvar|n}}. The dimension in which this happens depends on the radius {{math|''R''}}.\n\nTo find the {{mvar|n}} for which the maximum occurs, interpolate the function <math>n \\mapsto V_n(R)</math> to all real {{math|''x'' > 0}} by defining\n:<math>V(x, R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{x}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right)}R^x.</math>\nWhen {{math|''x''}} is not a positive integer, this function has no obvious geometric interpretation. However, it is smooth, so the techniques of calculus can be used to find maxima. \n\nThe extrema of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} for fixed {{mvar|R}} may occur only at the critical points or at the boundaries {{math|''x'' \u2192 0<sup>+</sup>}} and {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}}.  Because the logarithm is monotonically increasing, the critical points of <math>V(x, R)</math> are the same as those of its logarithm.  The derivative of <math>\\log V(x, R)</math> with respect to {{mvar|x}} is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(\\log V(x, R)\\big) = \\frac{\\log \\pi}{2} + \\log R - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c8}} is the [[digamma function]], the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the [[gamma function]].  The critical points of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} therefore occur at the solutions of\n:<math>\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R.</math>\n\nBecause the gamma function is [[logarithmically convex]] on the positive real axis, the digamma function is monotonically increasing there, so the above equation has at most one solution.  Because <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\psi(x) = -\\infty</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\psi(x) = +\\infty</math>, there is at least one positive real solution.  Therefore the above equation has a unique solution.  Denoting the solution by {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, we have\n:<math>x_0 =  2\\psi^{-1}(\\log \\pi + 2\\log R) - 2.</math>\n\nThe monotonicity of the digamma function along the positive real axis further implies that {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is increasing for all {{math|''x'' < ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and decreasing for all {{math|''x'' > ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.  It follows that {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is the unique maximum of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and that the maxima of {{math|''n'' \u21a6 ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} are contained in the set <math>\\{\\lfloor x_0\\rfloor, \\lceil x_0\\rceil\\}</math>.  If {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is an integer, then this set has only one element, and this element is the unique maximum of both {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}.  Otherwise, the set has two elements, and either {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} assumes its unique maximum at one of the two elements in the set, or {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is maximized at both these elements.\n\nMore explicit, though less precise, estimates may be derived by bounding the digamma function.  For {{math|''y'' > 1}}, the digamma function satisfies:<ref>N. Elezovic, C. Giordano and J. Pecaric, ''The best bounds in Gautschi\u2019s inequality'', Math. Inequal. Appl. 3 (2000), 239\u2013252.</ref>\n:<math>\\log\\left(y - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi(y) < \\log(y + e^{-\\gamma} - 1),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]].  Applying these bounds with {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''<sub>0</sub>|2}} + 1}} yields\n:<math>\\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R < \\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + e^{-\\gamma}\\right),</math>\nwhence\n:<math>2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma} < x_0 < 2\\pi R^2 - 1.</math>\n\nTherefore the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is achieved for some integer {{mvar|n}} such that\n:<math>\\lfloor 2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma}\\rfloor \\le n \\le \\lceil 2\\pi R^2 - 1\\rceil.</math>\nTo find the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}, it suffices to maximize it over all {{math|''n''}} in this interval.  Because <math>|2e^{-\\gamma} - 1| < 0.2</math>, this interval contains at most three integers and often only two.\n\nFor example, when {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1}}, these bounds imply that the maximum volume is achieved for some {{mvar|n}} for which {{math|\u230a5.08\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23085.28\u2309}}, that is, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}} or {{math|''n'' {{=}} 6}}.  An examination of the table above shows that it is achieved at the lower bound, in dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}}.  When {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1.1}}, the bounds are {{math|\u230a6.48\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.60\u2309}}, and the maximum is achieved at the upper bound, that is, when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}.  Finally, if <math>R = \\exp(11/12 - \\gamma/2) / \\sqrt\\pi \\approx 1.057</math>, then the bounds are {{math|\u230a5.90\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.02\u2309}}, so the interval of possible {{math|''n''}} contains three integers, and the maximum of both {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} and {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is achieved at the integer {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 6}}.\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere are many proofs of the above formulas.\n\n=== The volume is proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius ===\nAn important step in several proofs about volumes of {{math|''n''}}-balls, and a generally useful fact besides, is that the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is proportional to {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\propto R^n.</math>\nThe proportionality constant is the volume of the unit ball.\n\nThis is a special case of a general fact about volumes in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space: If {{math|''K''}}\nis a body (measurable set) in that space and {{math|''RK''}} is the body obtained by stretching in all directions by the factor {{math|''R''}} then the volume of {{math|''RK''}} equals {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}} times the volume of {{math|''K''}}. This is a direct consequence of the change of variables formula:\n:<math> V(RK) = \\int_{RK} dx = \\int_K R^n\\, dy = R^n V(K) </math>\nwhere {{math|1=''dx'' = ''dx''<sub>1</sub>\u2026''dx<sub>n</sub>''}} and the substitution {{math|1=''x'' = ''Ry''}} was made.\n\nAnother proof of the above relation, which avoids multi-dimensional integration, uses induction: The base case is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, where the proportionality is obvious. For the inductive case, assume that proportionality is true in dimension {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. Note that the intersection of an {{math|''n''}}-ball with a hyperplane is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. When the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball is written as an integral of volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\\right) \\,dx,</math>\nit is possible by the inductive assumption to remove a factor of {{math|''R''}} from the radius of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball to get:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^{n-1} \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2}\\right) \\,dx.</math>\nMaking the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|x|R}}''}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^n \\int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - t^2}\\right) \\,dt = R^n V_n(1),</math>\nwhich demonstrates the proportionality relation in dimension {{math|''n''}}. By induction, the proportionality relation is true in all dimensions.\n\n=== The two-dimension recursion formula ===\nA proof of the recursion formula relating the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball can be given using the proportionality formula above and integration in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]. Fix a plane through the center of the ball. Let {{math|''r''}} denote the distance between a point in the plane and the center of the sphere, and let {{math|''\u03b8''}} denote the azimuth. Intersecting the {{math|''n''}}-ball with the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-dimensional plane defined by fixing a radius and an azimuth gives an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of radius {{math|{{sqrt|''R''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. The volume of the ball can therefore be written as an iterated integral of the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls over the possible radii and azimuths:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R V_{n-2}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\right) \\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta,</math>\nThe azimuthal coordinate can be immediately integrated out. Applying the proportionality relation shows that the volume equals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\int_0^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,r\\,dr.</math>\nThe integral can be evaluated by making the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 \u2212 (''{{sfrac|r|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}} to get:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_n(R) &= 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\cdot \\left[-\\frac{R^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}\\right]_{r=0}^{r=R} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R),\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich is the two-dimension recursion formula.\n\nThe same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula. The base cases of the induction are the 0-ball and the 1-ball, which can be checked directly using the facts {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|{{sqrt|\u03c0}}|2}}}}. The inductive step is similar to the above, but instead of applying proportionality to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls, the inductive assumption is applied instead.\n\n=== The one-dimension recursion formula ===\nThe proportionality relation can also be used to prove the recursion formula relating the volumes of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. As in the proof of the proportionality formula, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball can be written as an integral over the volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls. Instead of making a substitution, however, the proportionality relation can be applied to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls in the integrand:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\int_{-R}^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-1}{2} \\,dx.</math>\nThe integrand is an [[even function]], so by symmetry the interval of integration can be restricted to {{math|[0, ''R'']}}. On the interval {{math|[0, ''R'']}}, it is possible to apply the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''{{sfrac|x|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}}. This transforms the expression into:\n:<math>V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-u)^\\frac{n-1}{2}u^{-\\frac12}\\,du</math>\nThe integral is a value of a well-known [[special function]] called the [[beta function]] {{math|\u0392(''x,y'')}}, and the volume in terms of the beta function is:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\Beta\\left(\\tfrac{n + 1}{2}, \\tfrac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta function can be expressed in terms of the gamma function in much the same way that factorials are related to [[binomial coefficient]]s. Applying this relationship gives:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nUsing the value {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} gives the one-dimension recursion formula:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\n\nAs with the two-dimension recursive formula, the same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula.\n\n=== Direct integration in spherical coordinates ===\nThe volume can be computed by integrating the volume element in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The spherical coordinate system has a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular coordinates {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}}, where the domain of each {{math|''\u03c6''}} except {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, \u03c0)}}, and the domain of {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, 2\u03c0)}}. The spherical volume element is:\n:<math>dV = r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\sin^{n-3}(\\varphi_2) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,dr\\,d\\varphi_1\\,d\\varphi_2 \\cdots d\\varphi_{n-1},</math>\nand the volume is the integral of this quantity over {{math|''r''}} between 0 and {{math|''R''}} and all possible angles:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi \\cdots \\int_0^{2\\pi} r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,d\\varphi_{n-1} \\cdots d\\varphi_1\\,dr.</math>\nEach of the factors in the integrand depends on only a single variable, and therefore the iterated integral can be written as a product of integrals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^{n-1}\\,dr\\right)\\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nThe integral over the radius is {{math|''{{sfrac|R<sup>n</sup>|n}}''}}. The intervals of integration on the angular coordinates can, by symmetry, be changed to {{math|[0, {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}]}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\left(2\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(4\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nEach of the remaining integrals is now a particular value of the beta function:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\cdots \\Beta\\left(1, \\frac12\\right) \\cdot 2\\Beta\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta functions can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac32\\right)} \\cdot 2 \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)}.</math>\nThis product telescopes. Combining this with the values {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} and {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\n\n=== Gaussian integrals ===\nThe volume formula can be proven directly using [[Gaussian integral]]s. Consider the function:\n:<math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right).</math>\nThis function is both rotationally invariant and a product of functions of one variable each. Using the fact that it is a product and the formula for the Gaussian integral gives:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 x_i^2\\right)\\,dx_i\\right) = (2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2},</math>\nwhere {{math|''dV''}} is the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume element. Using rotational invariance, the same integral can be computed in spherical coordinates:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{S^{n-1}(r)} \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right) \\,dA\\,dr,</math>\nwhere {{math|''S''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup>(''r'')}} is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dA''}} is the area element (equivalently, the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-dimensional volume element). The surface area of the sphere satisfies a proportionality equation similar to the one for the volume of a ball: If {{math|''A''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>(''r'')}} is the surface area of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}}, then:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(r) = r^{n-1} A_{n-1}(1).</math>\nApplying this to the above integral gives the expression:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right)\\,r^{n-1}\\,dr.</math>\nBy substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''r''<sup>2</sup>|2}}}}, the expression is transformed into:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) 2^\\frac{n-2}{2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-t} t^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,dt.</math>\nThis is the gamma function evaluated at {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}.\n\nCombining the two integrations shows that:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nTo derive the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} from this formula, integrate the surface area of a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} for {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 ''R''}} and apply the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\,r^{n-1}\\,dr = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}R^n = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n.</math>\n\n=== Geometric proof ===\n\nThe relations <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math> and <math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> and thus the volumes of ''n''-balls and areas of ''n''-spheres can also be derived geometrically.  As noted above, because a ball of radius <math>R</math> is obtained from a unit ball <math>B_n</math> by rescaling all directions in <math>R</math> times, <math>V_n(R)</math> is proportional to <math>R^n</math>, which implies <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR} = \\frac{n}{R} V_n(R)</math>.  Also, <math display=\"inline\">A_{n-1}(R) = \\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR}</math> because a ball is a union of concentric spheres and increasing radius by ''\u03b5'' corresponds to a shell of thickness ''\u03b5''.  Thus, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n}(R) = \\frac{R}{n}A_{n-1}(R)</math>; equivalently, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math>.\n\n<math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> follows from existence of a volume-preserving bijection between the unit sphere <math>S_{n+1}</math> and <math> S_1 \\times B_n</math>:\n: <math>(x,y,\\vec{z}) \\rarr \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\vec{z}\\right)</math>\n(<math>\\vec{z}</math> is an ''n''-tuple; <math>|(x,y,\\vec{z})|=1</math>; we are ignoring sets of measure 0).  Volume is preserved because at each point, the difference from [[isometry]] is a stretching in the ''xy'' plane (in <math display=\"inline\">1/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math> times in the direction of constant <math>x^2+y^2</math>) that exactly matches the compression in the direction of the [[gradient]] of <math>|\\vec{z}|</math> on <math>S_n</math> (the relevant angles being equal).  For <math>S_2</math>, a similar argument was originally made by [[Archimedes]] in [[On the Sphere and Cylinder]].\n\n== Balls in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norms ==\nThere are also explicit expressions for the volumes of balls in [[Lp space|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm]]s. The {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm of the vector {{math|''x'' {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is:\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n | x_i |^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p},</math>\nand an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball is the set of all vectors whose {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm is less than or equal to a fixed number called the radius of the ball. The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} is the standard Euclidean distance function, but other values of {{math|''p''}} occur in diverse contexts such as [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[dimensional regularization]].\n\nThe volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\frac{\\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{p} + 1\\right)R\\right)^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nThese volumes satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one dimension recurrence for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{p} + 1\\right) R\\right) \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{p} + 1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)} V^p_{n-1}(R).</math>\nFor {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, one recovers the recurrence for the volume of a Euclidean ball because {{math|2\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}}.\n\nFor example, in the cases {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, the volumes are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} V^1_n(R) &= \\frac{2^n}{n!}R^n, \\\\ V^\\infty_n(R) &= (2R)^n. \\end{align}</math>\nThese agree with elementary calculations of the volumes of [[cross-polytope]]s and [[hypercubes]].\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nFor most values of {{math|''p''}}, the surface area, <math>A_n^p(R)</math>, of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} (the boundary of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}}) cannot be calculated by differentiating the volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball with respect to its radius. While the volume can be expressed as an integral over the surface areas using the [[coarea formula]], the coarea formula contains a correction factor that accounts for how the {{math|''p''}}-norm varies from point to point. For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, this factor is one. However, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} then the correction factor is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}: the surface area of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} times the derivative of the volume of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} ball.  This can be seen most simply by applying the [[divergence theorem]] to the vector field {{math|'''F'''(x) {{=}} x}} to get\n\n:<math>nV^1_n(R) = </math>{{oiint\n| preintegral = <math>\\iiint_V\\left(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{F}\\right)\\,dV=</math>\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = </math> {{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}(|x_1|+\\cdots+|x_n|)\\,dS </math>\n}}  <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} </math>{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} A^1_n(R) </math>.\nFor other values of {{math|''p''}}, the constant is a complicated integral.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe volume formula can be generalized even further. For positive real numbers {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, define the unit {{math|(''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} ball to be:\n:<math>B_{p_1, \\ldots, p_n} = \\left\\{ x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n : \\vert x_1 \\vert^{p_1} + \\cdots + \\vert x_n \\vert^{p_n} \\le 1 \\right\\}.</math>\nThe volume of this ball has been known since the time of Dirichlet:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirichlet|first=P.

An {{math|''n''}}-ball is a ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The '''volume of a unit {{math|''n''}}-ball''' are important constants that occurs in formulas throughout mathematics; it generalizes the notion of the volume enclosed by a sphere in 3-dimensional space.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== The volume ===\nThe {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:<ref>Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.19#E4, Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.</ref>\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n,</math>\nwhere {{math|\u0393}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]].

Then the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} approaches zero as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity. This can be shown using the two-dimension recursion formula. At each step, the new factor being multiplied into the volume is proportional to {{math|1 / ''n''}}, where the constant of proportionality {{math|2\u03c0''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is independent of {{math|''n''}}. Eventually, {{math|''n''}} is so large that the new factor is less than 1. From then on, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball must decrease at least geometrically, and therefore it tends to zero. A variant on this proof uses the one-dimension recursion formula. Here, the new factor is proportional to a quotient of gamma functions. [[Gautschi's inequality]] bounds this quotient above by {{math|''n''<sup>\u22121/2</sup>}}. The argument concludes as before by showing that the volumes decrease at least geometrically.\n\nA more precise description of the high dimensional behavior of the volume can be obtained using [[Stirling's approximation]]. It implies the [[asymptotic formula]]:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\pi}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi e}{n}\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}R^n.</math>\nThe error in this approximation is a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. Stirling's approximation is in fact an underestimate of the gamma function, so the above formula is an upper bound. This provides another proof that the volume of the ball decreases exponentially: When {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, the factor {{math|''R''{{sqrt|2\u03c0''e''/''n''}}}} is less than one, and then the same argument as before applies.\n\nIf instead {{math|''V''}} is fixed while {{math|''n''}} is large, then by Stirling's approximation again, the radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} is approximately\n:<math>R_n(V) \\sim (\\pi n)^{\\frac{1}{2n}}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2\\pi e}}V^{\\frac{1}{n}}.</math>\nThis expression is a lower bound for {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}}, and the error is again a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. As {{math|''n''}} increases, {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}} grows as <math>\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).</math>\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nLet {{math|''A{{sub|n}}''(''R'')}} denote the surface area of the [[n-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]] of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is a union of concentric spheres, and consequently the surface area and the volume are related by:\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{d}{dR}V_{n+1}(R).</math>\nCombining this with the explicit formula for the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball gives\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n + 1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\big(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\big)}R^n.</math>\n\nSince the volume is proportional to a power of the radius, the above relation leads to a simple equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball. By applying the two-dimension recursion formula, it also gives an equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball.  These formulas, together with the volume and surface area of zero-dimensional balls, can be used as a system of recurrence relations for the volumes and surface areas of balls:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_0(R) &= 1, \\\\\nA_0(R) &= 2, \\\\\nV_{n+1}(R) &= \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R), \\\\\nA_{n+1}(R) &= (2\\pi R)V_n(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Dimension maximizing the volume of a fixed-radius ball ===\nSuppose that {{math|''R''}} is a fixed positive real number, and consider the volume {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} as a function of the positive integer {{nowrap|dimension {{math|''n''}}.}} Since the volume of a ball with fixed positive radius tends to zero as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}, the maximum volume is achieved for some value of {{mvar|n}}. The dimension in which this happens depends on the radius {{math|''R''}}.\n\nTo find the {{mvar|n}} for which the maximum occurs, interpolate the function <math>n \\mapsto V_n(R)</math> to all real {{math|''x'' > 0}} by defining\n:<math>V(x, R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{x}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right)}R^x.</math>\nWhen {{math|''x''}} is not a positive integer, this function has no obvious geometric interpretation. However, it is smooth, so the techniques of calculus can be used to find maxima. \n\nThe extrema of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} for fixed {{mvar|R}} may occur only at the critical points or at the boundaries {{math|''x'' \u2192 0<sup>+</sup>}} and {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}}.  Because the logarithm is monotonically increasing, the critical points of <math>V(x, R)</math> are the same as those of its logarithm.  The derivative of <math>\\log V(x, R)</math> with respect to {{mvar|x}} is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(\\log V(x, R)\\big) = \\frac{\\log \\pi}{2} + \\log R - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c8}} is the [[digamma function]], the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the [[gamma function]].  The critical points of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} therefore occur at the solutions of\n:<math>\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R.</math>\n\nBecause the gamma function is [[logarithmically convex]] on the positive real axis, the digamma function is monotonically increasing there, so the above equation has at most one solution.  Because <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\psi(x) = -\\infty</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\psi(x) = +\\infty</math>, there is at least one positive real solution.  Therefore the above equation has a unique solution.  Denoting the solution by {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, we have\n:<math>x_0 =  2\\psi^{-1}(\\log \\pi + 2\\log R) - 2.</math>\n\nThe monotonicity of the digamma function along the positive real axis further implies that {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is increasing for all {{math|''x'' < ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and decreasing for all {{math|''x'' > ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.  It follows that {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is the unique maximum of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and that the maxima of {{math|''n'' \u21a6 ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} are contained in the set <math>\\{\\lfloor x_0\\rfloor, \\lceil x_0\\rceil\\}</math>.  If {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is an integer, then this set has only one element, and this element is the unique maximum of both {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}.  Otherwise, the set has two elements, and either {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} assumes its unique maximum at one of the two elements in the set, or {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is maximized at both these elements.\n\nMore explicit, though less precise, estimates may be derived by bounding the digamma function.  For {{math|''y'' > 1}}, the digamma function satisfies:<ref>N. Elezovic, C. Giordano and J. Pecaric, ''The best bounds in Gautschi\u2019s inequality'', Math. Inequal. Appl. 3 (2000), 239\u2013252.</ref>\n:<math>\\log\\left(y - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi(y) < \\log(y + e^{-\\gamma} - 1),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]].  Applying these bounds with {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''<sub>0</sub>|2}} + 1}} yields\n:<math>\\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R < \\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + e^{-\\gamma}\\right),</math>\nwhence\n:<math>2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma} < x_0 < 2\\pi R^2 - 1.</math>\n\nTherefore the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is achieved for some integer {{mvar|n}} such that\n:<math>\\lfloor 2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma}\\rfloor \\le n \\le \\lceil 2\\pi R^2 - 1\\rceil.</math>\nTo find the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}, it suffices to maximize it over all {{math|''n''}} in this interval.  Because <math>|2e^{-\\gamma} - 1| < 0.2</math>, this interval contains at most three integers and often only two.\n\nFor example, when {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1}}, these bounds imply that the maximum volume is achieved for some {{mvar|n}} for which {{math|\u230a5.08\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23085.28\u2309}}, that is, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}} or {{math|''n'' {{=}} 6}}.  An examination of the table above shows that it is achieved at the lower bound, in dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}}.  When {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1.1}}, the bounds are {{math|\u230a6.48\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.60\u2309}}, and the maximum is achieved at the upper bound, that is, when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}.  Finally, if <math>R = \\exp(11/12 - \\gamma/2) / \\sqrt\\pi \\approx 1.057</math>, then the bounds are {{math|\u230a5.90\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.02\u2309}}, so the interval of possible {{math|''n''}} contains three integers, and the maximum of both {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} and {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is achieved at the integer {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 6}}.\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere are many proofs of the above formulas.\n\n=== The volume is proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius ===\nAn important step in several proofs about volumes of {{math|''n''}}-balls, and a generally useful fact besides, is that the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is proportional to {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\propto R^n.</math>\nThe proportionality constant is the volume of the unit ball.\n\nThis is a special case of a general fact about volumes in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space: If {{math|''K''}}\nis a body (measurable set) in that space and {{math|''RK''}} is the body obtained by stretching in all directions by the factor {{math|''R''}} then the volume of {{math|''RK''}} equals {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}} times the volume of {{math|''K''}}. This is a direct consequence of the change of variables formula:\n:<math> V(RK) = \\int_{RK} dx = \\int_K R^n\\, dy = R^n V(K) </math>\nwhere {{math|1=''dx'' = ''dx''<sub>1</sub>\u2026''dx<sub>n</sub>''}} and the substitution {{math|1=''x'' = ''Ry''}} was made.\n\nAnother proof of the above relation, which avoids multi-dimensional integration, uses induction: The base case is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, where the proportionality is obvious. For the inductive case, assume that proportionality is true in dimension {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. Note that the intersection of an {{math|''n''}}-ball with a hyperplane is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. When the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball is written as an integral of volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\\right) \\,dx,</math>\nit is possible by the inductive assumption to remove a factor of {{math|''R''}} from the radius of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball to get:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^{n-1} \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2}\\right) \\,dx.</math>\nMaking the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|x|R}}''}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^n \\int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - t^2}\\right) \\,dt = R^n V_n(1),</math>\nwhich demonstrates the proportionality relation in dimension {{math|''n''}}. By induction, the proportionality relation is true in all dimensions.\n\n=== The two-dimension recursion formula ===\nA proof of the recursion formula relating the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball can be given using the proportionality formula above and integration in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]. Fix a plane through the center of the ball. Let {{math|''r''}} denote the distance between a point in the plane and the center of the sphere, and let {{math|''\u03b8''}} denote the azimuth. Intersecting the {{math|''n''}}-ball with the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-dimensional plane defined by fixing a radius and an azimuth gives an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of radius {{math|{{sqrt|''R''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. The volume of the ball can therefore be written as an iterated integral of the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls over the possible radii and azimuths:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R V_{n-2}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\right) \\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta,</math>\nThe azimuthal coordinate can be immediately integrated out. Applying the proportionality relation shows that the volume equals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\int_0^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,r\\,dr.</math>\nThe integral can be evaluated by making the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 \u2212 (''{{sfrac|r|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}} to get:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_n(R) &= 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\cdot \\left[-\\frac{R^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}\\right]_{r=0}^{r=R} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R),\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich is the two-dimension recursion formula.\n\nThe same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula. The base cases of the induction are the 0-ball and the 1-ball, which can be checked directly using the facts {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|{{sqrt|\u03c0}}|2}}}}. The inductive step is similar to the above, but instead of applying proportionality to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls, the inductive assumption is applied instead.\n\n=== The one-dimension recursion formula ===\nThe proportionality relation can also be used to prove the recursion formula relating the volumes of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. As in the proof of the proportionality formula, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball can be written as an integral over the volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls. Instead of making a substitution, however, the proportionality relation can be applied to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls in the integrand:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\int_{-R}^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-1}{2} \\,dx.</math>\nThe integrand is an [[even function]], so by symmetry the interval of integration can be restricted to {{math|[0, ''R'']}}. On the interval {{math|[0, ''R'']}}, it is possible to apply the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''{{sfrac|x|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}}. This transforms the expression into:\n:<math>V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-u)^\\frac{n-1}{2}u^{-\\frac12}\\,du</math>\nThe integral is a value of a well-known [[special function]] called the [[beta function]] {{math|\u0392(''x,y'')}}, and the volume in terms of the beta function is:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\Beta\\left(\\tfrac{n + 1}{2}, \\tfrac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta function can be expressed in terms of the gamma function in much the same way that factorials are related to [[binomial coefficient]]s. Applying this relationship gives:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nUsing the value {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} gives the one-dimension recursion formula:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\n\nAs with the two-dimension recursive formula, the same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula.\n\n=== Direct integration in spherical coordinates ===\nThe volume can be computed by integrating the volume element in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The spherical coordinate system has a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular coordinates {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}}, where the domain of each {{math|''\u03c6''}} except {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, \u03c0)}}, and the domain of {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, 2\u03c0)}}. The spherical volume element is:\n:<math>dV = r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\sin^{n-3}(\\varphi_2) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,dr\\,d\\varphi_1\\,d\\varphi_2 \\cdots d\\varphi_{n-1},</math>\nand the volume is the integral of this quantity over {{math|''r''}} between 0 and {{math|''R''}} and all possible angles:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi \\cdots \\int_0^{2\\pi} r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,d\\varphi_{n-1} \\cdots d\\varphi_1\\,dr.</math>\nEach of the factors in the integrand depends on only a single variable, and therefore the iterated integral can be written as a product of integrals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^{n-1}\\,dr\\right)\\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nThe integral over the radius is {{math|''{{sfrac|R<sup>n</sup>|n}}''}}. The intervals of integration on the angular coordinates can, by symmetry, be changed to {{math|[0, {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}]}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\left(2\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(4\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nEach of the remaining integrals is now a particular value of the beta function:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\cdots \\Beta\\left(1, \\frac12\\right) \\cdot 2\\Beta\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta functions can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac32\\right)} \\cdot 2 \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)}.</math>\nThis product telescopes. Combining this with the values {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} and {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\n\n=== Gaussian integrals ===\nThe volume formula can be proven directly using [[Gaussian integral]]s. Consider the function:\n:<math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right).</math>\nThis function is both rotationally invariant and a product of functions of one variable each. Using the fact that it is a product and the formula for the Gaussian integral gives:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 x_i^2\\right)\\,dx_i\\right) = (2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2},</math>\nwhere {{math|''dV''}} is the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume element. Using rotational invariance, the same integral can be computed in spherical coordinates:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{S^{n-1}(r)} \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right) \\,dA\\,dr,</math>\nwhere {{math|''S''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup>(''r'')}} is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dA''}} is the area element (equivalently, the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-dimensional volume element). The surface area of the sphere satisfies a proportionality equation similar to the one for the volume of a ball: If {{math|''A''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>(''r'')}} is the surface area of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}}, then:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(r) = r^{n-1} A_{n-1}(1).</math>\nApplying this to the above integral gives the expression:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right)\\,r^{n-1}\\,dr.</math>\nBy substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''r''<sup>2</sup>|2}}}}, the expression is transformed into:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) 2^\\frac{n-2}{2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-t} t^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,dt.</math>\nThis is the gamma function evaluated at {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}.\n\nCombining the two integrations shows that:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nTo derive the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} from this formula, integrate the surface area of a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} for {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 ''R''}} and apply the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\,r^{n-1}\\,dr = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}R^n = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n.</math>\n\n=== Geometric proof ===\n\nThe relations <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math> and <math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> and thus the volumes of ''n''-balls and areas of ''n''-spheres can also be derived geometrically.  As noted above, because a ball of radius <math>R</math> is obtained from a unit ball <math>B_n</math> by rescaling all directions in <math>R</math> times, <math>V_n(R)</math> is proportional to <math>R^n</math>, which implies <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR} = \\frac{n}{R} V_n(R)</math>.  Also, <math display=\"inline\">A_{n-1}(R) = \\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR}</math> because a ball is a union of concentric spheres and increasing radius by ''\u03b5'' corresponds to a shell of thickness ''\u03b5''.  Thus, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n}(R) = \\frac{R}{n}A_{n-1}(R)</math>; equivalently, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math>.\n\n<math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> follows from existence of a volume-preserving bijection between the unit sphere <math>S_{n+1}</math> and <math> S_1 \\times B_n</math>:\n: <math>(x,y,\\vec{z}) \\rarr \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\vec{z}\\right)</math>\n(<math>\\vec{z}</math> is an ''n''-tuple; <math>|(x,y,\\vec{z})|=1</math>; we are ignoring sets of measure 0).  Volume is preserved because at each point, the difference from [[isometry]] is a stretching in the ''xy'' plane (in <math display=\"inline\">1/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math> times in the direction of constant <math>x^2+y^2</math>) that exactly matches the compression in the direction of the [[gradient]] of <math>|\\vec{z}|</math> on <math>S_n</math> (the relevant angles being equal).  For <math>S_2</math>, a similar argument was originally made by [[Archimedes]] in [[On the Sphere and Cylinder]].\n\n== Balls in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norms ==\nThere are also explicit expressions for the volumes of balls in [[Lp space|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm]]s. The {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm of the vector {{math|''x'' {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is:\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n | x_i |^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p},</math>\nand an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball is the set of all vectors whose {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm is less than or equal to a fixed number called the radius of the ball. The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} is the standard Euclidean distance function, but other values of {{math|''p''}} occur in diverse contexts such as [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[dimensional regularization]].\n\nThe volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\frac{\\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{p} + 1\\right)R\\right)^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nThese volumes satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one dimension recurrence for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{p} + 1\\right) R\\right) \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{p} + 1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)} V^p_{n-1}(R).</math>\nFor {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, one recovers the recurrence for the volume of a Euclidean ball because {{math|2\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}}.\n\nFor example, in the cases {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, the volumes are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} V^1_n(R) &= \\frac{2^n}{n!}R^n, \\\\ V^\\infty_n(R) &= (2R)^n. \\end{align}</math>\nThese agree with elementary calculations of the volumes of [[cross-polytope]]s and [[hypercubes]].\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nFor most values of {{math|''p''}}, the surface area, <math>A_n^p(R)</math>, of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} (the boundary of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}}) cannot be calculated by differentiating the volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball with respect to its radius. While the volume can be expressed as an integral over the surface areas using the [[coarea formula]], the coarea formula contains a correction factor that accounts for how the {{math|''p''}}-norm varies from point to point. For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, this factor is one. However, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} then the correction factor is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}: the surface area of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} times the derivative of the volume of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} ball.  This can be seen most simply by applying the [[divergence theorem]] to the vector field {{math|'''F'''(x) {{=}} x}} to get\n\n:<math>nV^1_n(R) = </math>{{oiint\n| preintegral = <math>\\iiint_V\\left(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{F}\\right)\\,dV=</math>\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = </math> {{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}(|x_1|+\\cdots+|x_n|)\\,dS </math>\n}}  <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} </math>{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} A^1_n(R) </math>.\nFor other values of {{math|''p''}}, the constant is a complicated integral.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe volume formula can be generalized even further. For positive real numbers {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, define the unit {{math|(''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} ball to be:\n:<math>B_{p_1, \\ldots, p_n} = \\left\\{ x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n : \\vert x_1 \\vert^{p_1} + \\cdots + \\vert x_n \\vert^{p_n} \\le 1 \\right\\}.</math>\nThe volume of this ball has been known since the time of Dirichlet:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirichlet|first=P.
