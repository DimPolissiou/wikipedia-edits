From left to right:  [[ENIAC]] board, [[EDVAC]] board, [[ORDVAC]] board, and [[BRLESC]]-I board, showing the trend toward miniaturization.]]\nThe '''history of computing hardware''' covers the developments from early simple devices to aid calculation to modern day [[computers]]. Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans. Early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations, like the [[abacus]], were called \"calculating machines\", called by proprietary names, or referred to as [[calculator]]s. The machine operator was called the computer.\n\nThe first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, then manipulate the device to obtain the result. Later, computers represented numbers in a continuous form, for instance distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a voltage. Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanical mechanism. Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, it greatly increased the precision of results. The development of [[transistor]] technology and then the [[integrated circuit]] chip led to a series of breakthroughs, starting with [[#Transistor computers|transistor computers]] and then [[#Integrated circuit computers|integrated circuit computers]], causing digital computers to largely replace [[analog computer]]s. [[Metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (MOS) [[large-scale integration]] (LSI) then enabled [[semiconductor memory]] and the [[microprocessor]], leading to another key breakthrough, the miniaturized [[personal computer]] (PC), in the 1970s. The cost of computers gradually became so low that personal computers by the 1990s, and then [[mobile computers]] ([[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]]) in the 2000s, became ubiquitous.\n\n==Early devices==\n{{See also|Timeline of computing hardware before 1950}}\n\n===Ancient and medieval=== \n[[File:Os d'Ishango IRSNB.JPG|thumb|100px|The [[Ishango bone]] is thought to be a Paleolithic tally stick.<ref>The [[Ishango bone]] is a [[bone tool]], dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] era, about 18,000 to 20,000&nbsp;BC. It is a dark brown length of bone, the [[fibula]] of a baboon. It has a series of tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the tool. It was found in 1960 in Belgian Congo. \u2013[http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html A very brief history of pure mathematics: The Ishango Bone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721075947/http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~schultz/3M3/history.html |date=2008-07-21 }} University of Western Australia School of Mathematics \u2013 accessed January 2007.</ref> ]]\n[[File:Abacus 6.png|thumb|right|[[Suanpan]] (the number represented on this abacus is 6,302,715,408)]]\nDevices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, mostly using [[one-to-one correspondence]] with [[finger counting|fingers]]. The earliest counting device was probably a form of [[tally stick]]. Later record keeping aids throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers.<ref>According to {{harvnb|Schmandt-Besserat|1981}}, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a [[bill of lading]] or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, first, clay impressions of the tokens were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count; the shapes of the impressions were abstracted into stylized marks; finally, the abstract marks were systematically used as numerals; these numerals were finally formalized as numbers. Eventually ([https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/files/2014/01/evolution_writing.pdf Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 5000 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130084757/http://www.laits.utexas.edu/ghazal/Chap1/dsb/chapter1.html |date=2012-01-30 }}) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.</ref><ref>{{Citation|first=Eleanor|last=Robson|author-link=Eleanor Robson|year=2008|title=Mathematics in Ancient Iraq|isbn=978-0-691-09182-2}}. p. 5: calculi were in use in Iraq for primitive accounting systems as early as 3200\u20133000 BCE, with commodity-specific counting representation systems.

What we now call the [[Roman abacus]] was used in [[Babylonia]] as early as c. 2700\u20132300 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European [[counting house]], a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.\n\nSeveral [[analog computer]]s were constructed in ancient and medieval times to perform astronomical calculations. These included the [[astrolabe]] and [[Antikythera mechanism]] from the [[Hellenistic world]] (c. 150\u2013100 BC).<ref>{{harvnb|Lazos|1994}}</ref> In [[Roman Egypt]], [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10\u201370 AD) made mechanical devices including automata and a programmable cart.<ref>{{citation |title=A programmable robot from 60 AD |author=Noel Sharkey|publisher=New Scientist|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blog/technology/2007/07/programmable-robot-from-60ad.html|date= July 4, 2007 |volume=2611}}</ref>  Other early mechanical devices used to perform one or another type of calculations include the [[planisphere]] and other mechanical computing devices invented by [[Abu Rayhan al-Biruni]] (c.

While producing the first logarithmic tables, Napier needed to perform many tedious multiplications. It was at this point that he designed his '[[Napier's bones]]', an abacus-like device that greatly simplified calculations that involved multiplication and division.<ref>A Spanish implementation of [[Napier's bones]] (1617), is documented in {{harvnb|Montaner|Simon|1887|pp=19\u201320}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Sliderule 2005.png|thumb|left|A slide rule]]\nSince [[real number]]s can be represented as distances or intervals on a line, the [[slide rule]] was invented in the 1620s, shortly after Napier's work, to allow multiplication and division operations to be carried out significantly faster than was previously possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Kells|Kern|Bland|1943|p=92}}</ref> [[Edmund Gunter]] built a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale at the [[University of Oxford]]. His device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations, including multiplication and division. [[William Oughtred]] greatly improved this in 1630 with his circular slide rule. He followed this up with the modern slide rule in 1632, essentially a combination of two [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s, held together with the hands. Slide rules were used by generations of engineers and other mathematically involved professional workers, until the invention of the [[pocket calculator]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kells|Kern|Bland|1943|p=82}}</ref>\n\n===Mechanical calculators===\n[[Wilhelm Schickard]], a German [[polymath]], designed a calculating machine in 1623 which combined a mechanised form of Napier's rods with the world's first mechanical adding machine built into the base. Because it made use of a single-tooth gear there were circumstances in which its carry mechanism would jam.<ref>\"...the single-tooth gear, like that used by Schickard, would not do for a general carry mechanism.  The single-tooth gear works fine if the carry is only going to be propagated a few places but, if the carry has to be propagated several places along the accumulator, the force needed to operate the machine would be of such magnitude that it would do damage to the delicate gear works.\" {{harvnb|Williams|1997|p=128}}</ref> A fire destroyed at least one of the machines in 1624 and it is believed Schickard was too disheartened to build another.\n[[File:Pascaline calculator.jpg|thumb|View through the back of [[Pascal's calculator]].

He attempted to create a machine that could be used not only for addition and subtraction but would utilise a moveable carriage to enable long multiplication and division. Leibniz once said \"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\"<ref>As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref> However, Leibniz did not incorporate a fully successful carry mechanism.   Leibniz also described the [[binary numeral system]],<ref>{{harvnb|Leibniz|1703}}</ref> a central ingredient of all modern computers. However, up to the 1940s, many subsequent designs (including [[Charles Babbage]]'s machines of the 1822 and even [[ENIAC]] of 1945) were based on the decimal system.<ref>[[Binary-coded decimal]] (BCD) is a numeric representation, or [[character encoding]], which is still widely used.</ref>\n\nAround 1820, [[Charles Xavier Thomas|Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar]] created what would over the rest of the century become the first successful, mass-produced mechanical calculator, the Thomas [[Arithmometer]]. It could be used to add and subtract, and with a moveable carriage the operator could also multiply, and divide by a process of long multiplication and long division.<ref>[http://www.cis.cornell.edu/boom/2005/ProjectArchive/arithometer/ Discovering the Arithmometer], [[Cornell University]]</ref> It utilised a stepped drum similar in conception to that invented by Leibniz. Mechanical calculators remained in use until the 1970s.\n\n===Punched-card data processing===\nIn 1804, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard|Joseph-Marie Jacquard]] developed [[Jacquard loom|a loom]] in which the pattern being woven was controlled by a paper tape constructed from [[punched cards]]. The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms. Punched cards were preceded by punch bands, as in the machine proposed by [[Basile Bouchon]]. These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently [[numerical control]] machine tools.\n\n[[File:Early SSA accounting operations.jpg|thumb|left|[[IBM]] punched-card accounting machines, 1936]]\nIn the late 1880s, the American [[Herman Hollerith]] invented data storage on [[punched card]]s that could then be read by a machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History \u2014 Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-30}}</ref> To process these punched cards, he invented the [[tabulating machine|tabulator]] and the [[keypunch]] machine.

After working on his revolutionary [[difference engine]], designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an [[Analytical Engine]], was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via [[punched card]]s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical [[loom]]s such as the [[Jacquard loom]]. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary [[base-10]] fixed-point arithmetic.\n\nThe Engine incorporated an [[arithmetic logic unit]], [[control flow]] in the form of [[conditional branching]] and [[program loop#Loops|loops]], and integrated [[computer memory|memory]], making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as [[Turing-complete]].<ref name=\"babbageonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/onlinestuff/stories/babbage.aspx?page=5|title=Babbage|work=Online stuff|publisher=Science Museum|date=2007-01-19 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827915.500-lets-build-babbages-ultimate-mechanical-computer.html|title=Let's build Babbage's ultimate mechanical computer|work=opinion|publisher=New Scientist|date= 23 December 2010|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nThere was to be a store, or memory, capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each (ca. 16.7 [[Kilobyte|kB]]).

Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been [[Turing-complete]] as later defined by [[Alan Turing]]. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.\n\nThe machine was about a century ahead of its time. However, the project was slowed by various problems including disputes with the chief machinist building parts for it. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand\u2014this was a major problem for a machine with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. [[Ada Lovelace]] translated and [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|added notes]] to the \"''Sketch of the Analytical Engine''\" by [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]].

When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for [[Coriolis effect]], weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying.

He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.\n\nHe also introduced the notion of a \"universal machine\" (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing\u2014insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.</ref> Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].

Like the Colossus, a \"program\" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the [[stored program]] electronic machines that came later.

Although substantially similar to Turing's design and containing comparatively little engineering detail, the computer architecture it outlined became known as the \"[[von Neumann architecture]]\". Turing presented a more detailed paper to the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) Executive Committee in 1946, giving the first reasonably complete design of a [[stored-program computer]], a device he called the [[Automatic Computing Engine]] (ACE). However, the better-known [[EDVAC]] design of [[John von Neumann]], who knew of Turing's theoretical work, received more publicity, despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas.<ref name=\"stanf\"/>\n\nTuring thought that the speed and the size of [[computer memory]] were crucial elements, so he proposed a high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 [[Kibibyte|KB]], accessed at a speed of 1 [[Hertz|MHz]].

Thirty-four patents resulted from the machine's development, and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the {{nowrap|[[IBM 701]]}} and [[IBM 702|702]] as well as the Ferranti Mark 1. The chief designers, [[Frederic Calland Williams|Frederic C.

Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat. Silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer service life.  Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space. Transistors greatly reduced computers' size, initial cost, and [[operating cost]]. Typically, second-generation computers were composed of large numbers of [[printed circuit board]]s such as the [[IBM Standard Modular System]],<ref name=IBM_SMS>{{harvnb|IBM_SMS|1960}}</ref> each carrying one to four [[logic gate]]s or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]].\n\nAt the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were [[germanium]] [[point-contact transistor]]s, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=34\u201335|ps=}} Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]], and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]],<ref name=LavingtonP37>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=37}}</ref> and a second version was completed there in April 1955.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=37|ps=}} The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[diode]]s, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125&nbsp;kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic [[drum memory]], so it was not the first completely transistorized computer.\n\nThat distinction goes to the [[Harwell CADET]] of 1955,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301|title=Some early transistor applications in the UK|journal=Engineering Science & Education Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=100\u2013106|year=1998|last1=Cooke-Yarborough|first1=E.H.}}</ref> built by the electronics division of the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]].

The second generation [[disk storage|disk data storage units]] were able to store tens of millions of letters and digits.  Next to the [[fixed disk]] storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable [[disk pack]] can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]] provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.\n\nMany second-generation CPUs delegated peripheral device communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled [[Unit record equipment|card reading and punching]], the main CPU executed calculations and binary [[branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. One [[Bus (computing)|databus]] would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's [[fetch-execute cycle]] rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the [[PDP-1]], the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took at least two memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the [[operand]] data fetch.\n\nDuring the second generation [[Remote Digital Terminal|remote terminal]] units (often in the form of [[Teleprinter]]s like a [[Friden Flexowriter]]) saw greatly increased use.<ref>[[Allen Newell]] used remote terminals to communicate cross-country with the [[RAND]] computers, as noted in {{harvnb|Simon|1991}}</ref>  Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center.

The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an [[Intel]] 8742, is an [[8-bit]] [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip.\n\nDuring the 1960s there was considerable overlap between second and third generation technologies.<ref>In the defense field, considerable work was done in the computerized implementation of equations such as {{harvnb|Kalman|1960|pp= 35\u201345}}</ref>  IBM implemented its [[IBM Solid Logic Technology]] modules in [[hybrid circuit]]s for the IBM System/360 in 1964. As late as 1975, Sperry Univac continued the manufacture of second-generation machines such as the UNIVAC 494. The [[Burroughs large systems]] such as the B5000 were [[stack machine]]s, which allowed for simpler programming. These [[pushdown automaton]]s were also implemented in minicomputers and microprocessors later, which influenced programming language design. Minicomputers served as low-cost computer centers for industry, business and universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Eckhouse|Morris|1979|pp= 1\u20132}}</ref> It became possible to simulate analog circuits with the ''simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis'', or [[SPICE]] (1971) on minicomputers, one of the programs for electronic design automation ([[:Category:Electronic design automation software|EDA]]).\nThe microprocessor led to the development of the [[microcomputer]], small, low-cost computers that could be owned by individuals and small businesses. Microcomputers, the first of which appeared in the 1970s, became ubiquitous in the 1980s and beyond.\n\n[[File:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|right|thumb|Altair 8800]]\nWhile which specific system is considered the first microcomputer is a matter of debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the [[Intel 4004]] and its successor, the [[Intel 8008]], the first commercially available microcomputer kit was the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]], which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of ''[[Popular Electronics]]''. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of [[DRAM]] in its initial package and no input-output except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as [[Cromemco]] and [[Processor Technology]] soon began supplying additional [[S-100 bus]] hardware for the Altair 8800.\n\nIn April 1975 at the [[Hannover Messe|Hannover Fair]], [[Olivetti]] presented the [[Olivetti P6060|P6060]], the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system. The central processing unit consisted of two cards, code named PUCE1 and PUCE2, and unlike most other personal computers was built with [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] components rather than a microprocessor. It had one or two 8\" [[floppy disk]] drives, a 32-character [[plasma display]], 80-column graphical [[thermal printer]], 48 Kbytes of [[RAM]], and [[BASIC]] language. It weighed {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. As a complete system, this was a significant step from the Altair, though it never achieved the same success. It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1977, most microcomputers, such as the [[KIM-1|MOS Technology KIM-1]], the [[Altair 8800]], and some versions of the [[Apple I]], were sold as kits for do-it-yourselfers. Pre-assembled systems did not gain much ground until 1977, with the introduction of the [[Apple II]], the [[Tandy TRS-80]], the first [[SWTPC]] computers, and the [[Commodore PET]]. Computing has evolved with microcomputer architectures, with features added from their larger brethren, now dominant in most market segments.\n\nA NeXT Computer and its [[object-oriented]] development tools and libraries were used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and [[Robert Cailliau]] at [[CERN]] to develop the world's first [[web server]] software, [[CERN httpd]], and also used to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]].\n\nSystems as complicated as computers require very high [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable \u2013 installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. [[Hot plugging|Hot-pluggable]] hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when [[server farm]]s are the delivery platform.<ref>\"Since 2005, its [Google's] data centers have been composed of standard shipping containers\u2014each with 1,160 servers and a power consumption that can reach 250 kilowatts.\"&nbsp;\u2014 Ben Jai of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2009}}</ref> Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working on the concept of replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.<ref>\"If you're running 10,000 machines, something is going to die every day.\" \u2014Jeff Dean of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2008}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/a7640a2743922dcf?pli=1|title=Google Groups|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, [[multi-core]] CPUs became commercially available.<ref>Intel has unveiled a [http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=825 single-chip version of a 48-core CPU] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814203128/http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=825 |date=2010-08-14 }} for software and circuit research in cloud computing: accessdate=2009-12-02.

Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS [[logic gates]] developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically.

Before the 20th century, most calculations were done by humans. Early mechanical tools to help humans with digital calculations, like the [[abacus]], were called \"calculating machines\", called by proprietary names, or referred to as [[calculator]]s. The machine operator was called the computer.\n\nThe first aids to computation were purely mechanical devices which required the operator to set up the initial values of an elementary arithmetic operation, then manipulate the device to obtain the result. Later, computers represented numbers in a continuous form, for instance distance along a scale, rotation of a shaft, or a voltage. Numbers could also be represented in the form of digits, automatically manipulated by a mechanical mechanism. Although this approach generally required more complex mechanisms, it greatly increased the precision of results. The development of [[transistor]] technology and then the [[integrated circuit]] chip led to a series of breakthroughs, starting with [[#Transistor computers|transistor computers]] and then [[#Integrated circuit computers|integrated circuit computers]], causing digital computers to largely replace [[analog computer]]s.

He attempted to create a machine that could be used not only for addition and subtraction but would utilise a moveable carriage to enable long multiplication and division. Leibniz once said \"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labour of calculation which could safely be relegated to anyone else if machines were used.\"<ref>As quoted in {{harvnb|Smith|1929|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref> However, Leibniz did not incorporate a fully successful carry mechanism.

Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards.\n\nThe machine was about a century ahead of its time. However, the project was slowed by various problems including disputes with the chief machinist building parts for it. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand\u2014this was a major problem for a machine with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing, but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. [[Ada Lovelace]] translated and [[Ada Byron's notes on the analytical engine|added notes]] to the \"''Sketch of the Analytical Engine''\" by [[Luigi Federico Menabrea]].

When gunnery ranges increased dramatically in the late 19th century it was no longer a simple matter of calculating the proper aim point, given the flight times of the shells. Various spotters on board the ship would relay distance measures and observations to a central plotting station. There the fire direction teams fed in the location, speed and direction of the ship and its target, as well as various adjustments for [[Coriolis effect]], weather effects on the air, and other adjustments; the computer would then output a firing solution, which would be fed to the turrets for laying. In 1912, British engineer [[Arthur Pollen]] developed the first electrically powered mechanical [[analogue computer]] (called at the time the Argo Clock).{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} It was used by the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] in [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The alternative [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Table]] fire control system was fitted to British capital ships by mid-1916.\n\nMechanical devices were also used to aid the [[bombsight|accuracy of aerial bombing]]. [[Drift Sight]] was the first such aid, developed by [[Harry Wimperis]] in 1916 for the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]; it measured the [[wind speed]] from the air, and used that measurement to calculate the wind's effects on the trajectory of the bombs. The system was later improved with the [[Course Setting Bomb Sight]], and reached a climax with [[World War II]] bomb sights, [[Mark XIV bomb sight]] ([[RAF Bomber Command]]) and the [[Norden bombsight|Norden]]<ref>{{harvnb|Norden}}</ref> ([[United States Army Air Forces]]).\n\nThe art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the [[differential analyzer]],<ref>{{harvnb|Coriolis|1836|pp=5\u20139}}</ref> built by H.

Online versions: [http://plms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s2-42/1/230 Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society] [http://www.thocp.net/biographies/papers/turing_oncomputablenumbers_1936.pdf Another version online.]</ref> ''On Computable Numbers''. Turing reformulated [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing G\u00f6del's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.\n\nHe also introduced the notion of a \"universal machine\" (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other machine, or in other words, it is provably capable of computing anything that is computable by executing a program stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasized to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing\u2014insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.</ref> Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]]. Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be [[Turing-complete]], which is to say, they have [[algorithm]] execution capability equivalent to a [[universal Turing machine]].\n\n===Electromechanical computers===\n{{further|Mechanical computer#Electro-mechanical computers}}\nThe era of modern computing began with a flurry of development before and during World War II. Most digital computers built in this period were electromechanical \u2013 electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation.

His 1945 report \u2018Proposed Electronic Calculator\u2019 was the first specification for such a device.\n\nMeanwhile, [[John von Neumann]] at the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], circulated his ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' in 1945. Although substantially similar to Turing's design and containing comparatively little engineering detail, the computer architecture it outlined became known as the \"[[von Neumann architecture]]\". Turing presented a more detailed paper to the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) Executive Committee in 1946, giving the first reasonably complete design of a [[stored-program computer]], a device he called the [[Automatic Computing Engine]] (ACE). However, the better-known [[EDVAC]] design of [[John von Neumann]], who knew of Turing's theoretical work, received more publicity, despite its incomplete nature and questionable lack of attribution of the sources of some of the ideas.<ref name=\"stanf\"/>\n\nTuring thought that the speed and the size of [[computer memory]] were crucial elements, so he proposed a high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 [[Kibibyte|KB]], accessed at a speed of 1 [[Hertz|MHz]]. The ACE implemented [[subroutine]] calls, whereas the EDVAC did not, and the ACE also used ''Abbreviated Computer Instructions,'' an early form of [[programming language]].\n\n===Manchester Baby===\n{{Main|Manchester Baby}}\n[[File:SSEM Manchester museum close up.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Three tall racks containing electronic circuit boards|A section of the rebuilt [[Manchester Baby]], the first electronic stored-program computer]]\nThe [[Manchester Baby]] was the world's first electronic [[stored-program computer]].

Thirty-four patents resulted from the machine's development, and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the {{nowrap|[[IBM 701]]}} and [[IBM 702|702]] as well as the Ferranti Mark 1.

Typically, second-generation computers were composed of large numbers of [[printed circuit board]]s such as the [[IBM Standard Modular System]],<ref name=IBM_SMS>{{harvnb|IBM_SMS|1960}}</ref> each carrying one to four [[logic gate]]s or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]].\n\nAt the [[University of Manchester]], a team under the leadership of [[Tom Kilburn]] designed and built a machine using the newly developed [[transistor]]s instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were [[germanium]] [[point-contact transistor]]s, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|pp=34\u201335|ps=}} Their first [[transistor computer|transistorised computer]], and the first in the world, was [[Manchester computers#Transistor Computer|operational by 1953]],<ref name=LavingtonP37>{{Harvnb|Lavington|1998|p=37}}</ref> and a second version was completed there in April 1955.{{sfnp|Lavington|1998|p=37|ps=}} The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[diode]]s, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125&nbsp;kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic [[drum memory]], so it was not the first completely transistorized computer.\n\nThat distinction goes to the [[Harwell CADET]] of 1955,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1049/esej:19980301|title=Some early transistor applications in the UK|journal=Engineering Science & Education Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=100\u2013106|year=1998|last1=Cooke-Yarborough|first1=E.H.}}</ref> built by the electronics division of the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] at [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]. The design featured a 64-kilobyte magnetic [[drum memory]] store with multiple moving heads that had been designed at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]]. By 1953 this team had transistor circuits operating to read and write on a smaller magnetic drum from the [[Royal Radar Establishment]]. The machine used a low clock speed of only 58&nbsp;kHz to avoid having to use any valves to generate the clock waveforms.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cooke-Yarborough | first = E.H. | title = Introduction to Transistor Circuits | publisher = Oliver and Boyd | year = 1957 | location = Edinburgh | pages = 139}}</ref><ref name=\"ieeexplore.ieee\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1049/esej:19980301| title = Some early transistor applications in the UK| journal = Engineering Science & Education Journal| volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 100\u2013106| year = 1998| last1 = Cooke-Yarborough| first1 = E.H.}}</ref>\n\nCADET used 324 [[point-contact transistor]]s provided by the UK company [[Standard Telephones and Cables]]; 76 [[Bipolar junction transistor|junction transistor]]s were used for the first stage amplifiers for data read from the drum, since [[point-contact transistor]]s were too noisy.

IBM installed more than ten thousand 1401s between 1960 and 1964.\n\n===Transistor peripherals===\nTransistorized electronics improved not only the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (Central Processing Unit), but also the [[peripheral|peripheral devices]]. The second generation [[disk storage|disk data storage units]] were able to store tens of millions of letters and digits.  Next to the [[fixed disk]] storage units, connected to the CPU via high-speed data transmission, were removable disk data storage units. A removable [[disk pack]] can be easily exchanged with another pack in a few seconds. Even if the removable disks' capacity is smaller than fixed disks, their interchangeability guarantees a nearly unlimited quantity of data close at hand. [[Magnetic tape data storage|Magnetic tape]] provided archival capability for this data, at a lower cost than disk.\n\nMany second-generation CPUs delegated peripheral device communications to a secondary processor. For example, while the communication processor controlled [[Unit record equipment|card reading and punching]], the main CPU executed calculations and binary [[branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. One [[Bus (computing)|databus]] would bear data between the main CPU and core memory at the CPU's [[fetch-execute cycle]] rate, and other databusses would typically serve the peripheral devices. On the [[PDP-1]], the core memory's cycle time was 5 microseconds; consequently most arithmetic instructions took 10 microseconds (100,000 operations per second) because most operations took at least two memory cycles; one for the instruction, one for the [[operand]] data fetch.\n\nDuring the second generation [[Remote Digital Terminal|remote terminal]] units (often in the form of [[Teleprinter]]s like a [[Friden Flexowriter]]) saw greatly increased use.<ref>[[Allen Newell]] used remote terminals to communicate cross-country with the [[RAND]] computers, as noted in {{harvnb|Simon|1991}}</ref>  Telephone connections provided sufficient speed for early remote terminals and allowed hundreds of kilometers separation between remote-terminals and the computing center. Eventually these stand-alone computer networks would be generalized into an interconnected ''[[history of the Internet|network of networks]]''\u2014the Internet.<ref>[[Robert Taylor (computer scientist)|Bob Taylor]] conceived of a generalized protocol to link together multiple networks to be viewed as a single session regardless of the specific network: \"Wait a minute.

The integrated circuit in the image on the right, for example, an [[Intel]] 8742, is an [[8-bit]] [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip.\n\nDuring the 1960s there was considerable overlap between second and third generation technologies.<ref>In the defense field, considerable work was done in the computerized implementation of equations such as {{harvnb|Kalman|1960|pp= 35\u201345}}</ref>  IBM implemented its [[IBM Solid Logic Technology]] modules in [[hybrid circuit]]s for the IBM System/360 in 1964. As late as 1975, Sperry Univac continued the manufacture of second-generation machines such as the UNIVAC 494. The [[Burroughs large systems]] such as the B5000 were [[stack machine]]s, which allowed for simpler programming. These [[pushdown automaton]]s were also implemented in minicomputers and microprocessors later, which influenced programming language design. Minicomputers served as low-cost computer centers for industry, business and universities.<ref>{{harvnb|Eckhouse|Morris|1979|pp= 1\u20132}}</ref> It became possible to simulate analog circuits with the ''simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis'', or [[SPICE]] (1971) on minicomputers, one of the programs for electronic design automation ([[:Category:Electronic design automation software|EDA]]).\nThe microprocessor led to the development of the [[microcomputer]], small, low-cost computers that could be owned by individuals and small businesses. Microcomputers, the first of which appeared in the 1970s, became ubiquitous in the 1980s and beyond.\n\n[[File:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|right|thumb|Altair 8800]]\nWhile which specific system is considered the first microcomputer is a matter of debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the [[Intel 4004]] and its successor, the [[Intel 8008]], the first commercially available microcomputer kit was the [[Intel 8080]]-based [[Altair 8800]], which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of ''[[Popular Electronics]]''. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of [[DRAM]] in its initial package and no input-output except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as [[Cromemco]] and [[Processor Technology]] soon began supplying additional [[S-100 bus]] hardware for the Altair 8800.\n\nIn April 1975 at the [[Hannover Messe|Hannover Fair]], [[Olivetti]] presented the [[Olivetti P6060|P6060]], the world's first complete, pre-assembled personal computer system. The central processing unit consisted of two cards, code named PUCE1 and PUCE2, and unlike most other personal computers was built with [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] components rather than a microprocessor. It had one or two 8\" [[floppy disk]] drives, a 32-character [[plasma display]], 80-column graphical [[thermal printer]], 48 Kbytes of [[RAM]], and [[BASIC]] language. It weighed {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. As a complete system, this was a significant step from the Altair, though it never achieved the same success. It was in competition with a similar product by IBM that had an external floppy disk drive.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1977, most microcomputers, such as the [[KIM-1|MOS Technology KIM-1]], the [[Altair 8800]], and some versions of the [[Apple I]], were sold as kits for do-it-yourselfers. Pre-assembled systems did not gain much ground until 1977, with the introduction of the [[Apple II]], the [[Tandy TRS-80]], the first [[SWTPC]] computers, and the [[Commodore PET]]. Computing has evolved with microcomputer architectures, with features added from their larger brethren, now dominant in most market segments.\n\nA NeXT Computer and its [[object-oriented]] development tools and libraries were used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and [[Robert Cailliau]] at [[CERN]] to develop the world's first [[web server]] software, [[CERN httpd]], and also used to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]].\n\nSystems as complicated as computers require very high [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. ENIAC remained on, in continuous operation from 1947 to 1955, for eight years before being shut down. Although a vacuum tube might fail, it would be replaced without bringing down the system. By the simple strategy of never shutting down ENIAC, the failures were dramatically reduced. The vacuum-tube SAGE air-defense computers became remarkably reliable \u2013 installed in pairs, one off-line, tubes likely to fail did so when the computer was intentionally run at reduced power to find them. [[Hot plugging|Hot-pluggable]] hard disks, like the hot-pluggable vacuum tubes of yesteryear, continue the tradition of repair during continuous operation. Semiconductor memories routinely have no errors when they operate, although operating systems like Unix have employed memory tests on start-up to detect failing hardware. Today, the requirement of reliable performance is made even more stringent when [[server farm]]s are the delivery platform.<ref>\"Since 2005, its [Google's] data centers have been composed of standard shipping containers\u2014each with 1,160 servers and a power consumption that can reach 250 kilowatts.\"&nbsp;\u2014 Ben Jai of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2009}}</ref> Google has managed this by using fault-tolerant software to recover from hardware failures, and is even working on the concept of replacing entire server farms on-the-fly, during a service event.<ref>\"If you're running 10,000 machines, something is going to die every day.\" \u2014Jeff Dean of Google, as quoted in {{harvnb|Shankland|2008}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/google-appengine/browse_thread/thread/a7640a2743922dcf?pli=1|title=Google Groups|accessdate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century, [[multi-core]] CPUs became commercially available.<ref>Intel has unveiled a [http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=825 single-chip version of a 48-core CPU] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814203128/http://www.pcper.com/article.php?aid=825 |date=2010-08-14 }} for software and circuit research in cloud computing: accessdate=2009-12-02.

Currently, CAMs (or associative arrays) in software are programming-language-specific. Semiconductor memory cell arrays are very regular structures, and manufacturers prove their processes on them; this allows price reductions on memory products. During the 1980s, CMOS [[logic gates]] developed into devices that could be made as fast as other circuit types; computer power consumption could therefore be decreased dramatically. Unlike the continuous current draw of a gate based on other logic types, a [[CMOS]] gate only draws significant current during the 'transition' between logic states<!--<ref>{{harvnb|Mead |Conway|1980|pp= 0}}</ref>-->, except for leakage.\n\nThis has allowed computing to become a [[commodity]] which is now ubiquitous, embedded in [[embedded system|many forms]], from greeting cards and [[Mobile phone|telephone]]s to [[Satellite communications#History|satellites]].

It is a small, plump bird about {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} long. Males have black plumage with a blue back and a red crown, and the two central tail feathers are greatly elongated.. Females and juveniles are olive-green with paler underparts. At breeding time, males are involved in a cooperative [[Lek mating|lekking]] behaviour with a complex coordinated courtship dance. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has rated its conservation status as being of \"[[Least-concern species|least concern]]\".\n\n==Description==\nLarge for a [[manakin]], the long-tailed measures about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and weighs {{convert|18|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=NeoBirds/>\n\nThe male is mostly a rich black. This is contrasted by a bright red crown and legs. The back is bright blue. The two central tail feathers are narrow and greatly elongated. The female is olive green, paler below and on the chin and throat. Some females have a small amount of red in the crown.<ref name=NeoBirds/>\n\nIt closely resembles the [[lance-tailed manakin|lance-tailed manakin (''C. lanceolata'')]], the [[blue-backed manakin|blue-backed manakin (''C. pareola'')]], the [[swallow-tailed manakin|swallow-tailed manakin (''C. caudata'')]], and the [[Yungas manakin|Yungas manakin (''C. boliviana'')]], which all have the same red crown and blue back. There is, however, no overlap in range with these four species.<ref name=NeoBirds/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe long-tailed manakin is found in [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], and [[Nicaragua]]. Its natural [[habitat]]s are [[subtropical or tropical dry forest]], [[subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest]], and heavily degraded former forest.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe manakin species are very interesting in their family life. Long-tailed manakin males form a long-term partnership duo or trio. Together they sing in synchrony and, for any female who is attracted by their singing, perform a complex coordinated courtship dance. If she mates, only the alpha male inseminates her. Among many displaying male partnerships in a locality (a dispersed lek), only one or a very few males may account for the vast majority of matings in a given breeding season. As in other lekking species, the female then builds the nest and raises the young without involvement by males.<ref name=Monteverde/>\n\n==Status==\nThis bird has a very wide range, is fairly common and is presumed to have a large total population. The population trend is thought to be stable and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has rated the bird's conservation status as being of \"[[Least-concern species|least concern]]\".<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n* <ref name=NeoBirds>{{cite web |url=http://neotropical.birds.cornell.edu/portal/species/overview?p_p_spp=503116 |title=Long-tailed Manakin (''Chiroxiphia linearis'') |last1=Kanaski |first1=Alina |last2=Stuligross |first2=Clara |last3=Pareja |first3=Jose |last4=Tori |first4=Wendy |editor-last=Schulenberg |editor-first=T.S. |date=2012  |work=Neotropical Birds Online |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell Lab of Ornithology |accessdate=14 August 2014}}</ref>\n* <ref name=Monteverde>{{cite book |title=Monteverde: Ecology And Conservation Of A Tropical Cloud Forest |editor1-last=Nadkarni |editor1-first=Nalini M. |editor2-last=Wheelwright |editor2-first=Nathaniel T. |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-19-509560-9 |last=McDonald |first=David B. |contribution=Cooperation Between Male Long-tailed Manakins |pages=204\u2013205}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Chiroxiphia linearis}}\n{{Wikispecies|Chiroxiphia linearis}}\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7891243.stm BBC article and video of males cooperating in courtship]\n* [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Chiroxiphia_linearis/ Long-tailed manakin profile at Animal Diversity Web]\n* {{InternetBirdCollection|long-tailed-manakin-chiroxiphia-linearis|Long-tailed manakin}}\n* {{VIREO|Long-tailed+manakin}}\n* {{IUCN_Map|22701071|Chiroxiphia linearis}}\n* [http://www.gaianicaragua.org/chiroxiphialinearis.html Long-tailed Manakin in Laguna de Apoyo Nature Reserve, Nicaragua]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q942728}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:manakin, long-tailed}}\n[[Category:Chiroxiphia|long-tailed manakin]]\n[[Category:Native birds of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Birds of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Birds of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Birds of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Birds of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1838|long-tailed manakin]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| name = Long-tailed manakin\n| image = Flickr - Rainbirder - Long-tailed Manakin (Chiroxiphia linearis).jpg\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=iucn>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22701071/0 |title=''Chiroxiphia linearis'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Chiroxiphia\n| species = linearis\n| authority = ([[Charles Lucien Bonaparte|Bonaparte]], 1838)\n| synonyms = \n}}\n\nThe '''long-tailed manakin''' (''Chiroxiphia linearis'') is a species of [[bird]] in the [[Pipridae]] family native to Central America where it inhabits both wet and dry tropical and subtropical forests.
