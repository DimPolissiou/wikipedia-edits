The teleplay was written by [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]], based on a story by [[Marc Scott Zicree]], and directed by [[Avery Brooks]]. Almost the full cast of ''DS9'' portrays human characters, without their alien costumes.\n\nThe stress of [[Dominion War|the war]] is getting to Benjamin Sisko and his dream-like visions recur during a visit from his father. Inside Sisko's mind, reality and fantasy mix into a vision set in mid-20th century New York City. The episode was novelized by [[Steven Barnes]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/farbeyondstars0000barn|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Far Beyond the Stars|first=Steven|last=Barnes|authorlink=Steven Barnes|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0671024307|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDistraught by the death of a close friend in the [[Dominion War]], Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] speaks with his father about leaving [[Starfleet]], but as the two talk, Sisko is distracted by a vision of a man dressed in 20th-century clothes. When Sisko's visions become more frequent and pervasive, [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] examines him, and finds similar brain activity to a prior episode of visions Sisko experienced (in the episode \"[[Rapture (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rapture]]\").\n\nSuddenly, Sisko is taken over by his vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s [[New York City]]. Russell writes for the science fiction magazine ''Incredible Tales'' and most of the people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. He runs into his coworker Albert Macklin ([[Colm Meaney]]/[[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]]) and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff ([[Armin Shimerman]]/[[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]/[[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K. C. Hunter ([[Nana Visitor]]/[[Kira Nerys|Kira]]) and Julius Eaton ([[Alexander Siddig]]/[[Julian Bashir|Bashir)]] banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse ([[J. G. Hertzler]]/[[Martok]]) arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay \"sleep late\" that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell objects, realizing that he will be excluded too, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.\n\nLeaving the office that night, a gust of wind takes Russell's drawing, which lands at the feet of two police officers, Burt Ryan ([[Marc Alaimo]]/[[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]) and Kevin Mulkahey ([[Jeffrey Combs]]/Weyoun). The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nMuch work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production.

The teleplay was written by [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]], based on a story by [[Marc Scott Zicree]], and directed by [[Avery Brooks]]. Almost the full cast of ''DS9'' portrays human characters, without their alien costumes.\n\nThe stress of [[Dominion War|the war]] is getting to Benjamin Sisko and his dream-like visions recur during a visit from his father. Inside Sisko's mind, reality and fantasy mix into a vision set in mid-20th century New York City. The episode was novelized by [[Steven Barnes]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/farbeyondstars0000barn|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Far Beyond the Stars|first=Steven|last=Barnes|authorlink=Steven Barnes|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0671024307|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDistraught by the death of a close friend in the [[Dominion War]], Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] speaks with his father about leaving [[Starfleet]], but as the two talk, Sisko is distracted by a vision of a man dressed in 20th-century clothes. When Sisko's visions become more frequent and pervasive, [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] examines him, and finds similar brain activity to a prior episode of visions Sisko experienced (in the episode \"[[Rapture (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rapture]]\").\n\nSuddenly, Sisko is taken over by his vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s [[New York City]]. Russell writes for the science fiction magazine ''Incredible Tales'' and most of the people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. He runs into his coworker Albert Macklin ([[Colm Meaney]]/[[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]]) and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff ([[Armin Shimerman]]/[[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]/[[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K. C. Hunter ([[Nana Visitor]]/[[Kira Nerys|Kira]]) and Julius Eaton ([[Alexander Siddig]]/[[Julian Bashir|Bashir)]] banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse ([[J. G. Hertzler]]/[[Martok]]) arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay \"sleep late\" that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell objects, realizing that he will be excluded too, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.\n\nLeaving the office that night, a gust of wind takes Russell's drawing, which lands at the feet of two police officers, Burt Ryan ([[Marc Alaimo]]/[[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]) and Kevin Mulkahey ([[Jeffrey Combs]]/Weyoun). The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nA large amount of work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production.

The line was extended to its present terminus of \u014cminato Station by September 25 1921. In 1922 the line was nationalised, and renamed the \u014cminato Line of the [[Japanese Government Railway]] (JGR, later [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]]).\n\nExpress ''Natsudomari'' operations began from [[Aomori Station]] on a seasonal basis in 1968. The express was later downgraded to rapid service and renamed the ''Usori'', and later the [[Shimokita (train)|''Shimokita'']]. All freight operations ceased on February 1 1984. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1 1984 the line came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company. On December 4 1999 a new [[centralized traffic control]] (CTC) system became operational. In 2002, seasonal excursion train ''Kirakira Michinoku'' operations commenced and a limited number of ''Shimokita'' trains were extended to terminate at [[Hachinohe Station]] instead of Noheji. The ''Shimokita'' service operates a daily round trip to Aomori and 3 round trips to Hachinohe in conjunction with the [[Aoimori Railway]].<ref name=\"Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jreast-timetable.jp/1802/train/015/016891.html|title=Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)|website=www.jreast.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nThe [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]], including Noheji was transferred from JR East to Aoimori Railway on December 4 2010 following the extension of the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] from Hachinohe to Shin-Aomori.<ref>Tetsudo Hobidas: [http://rail.hobidas.com/news/info/article/109792.html \"JR\u6771\u65e5\u672c \u6771\u5317\u672c\u7dda\u516b\u6238\u2015\u9752\u68ee\u9593\u306e\u5ec3\u6b62\u3092\u5c4a\u51fa \" (November 27, 2009)].

The [[Seikan Tunnel]] was originally proposed to utilise the roadbed of the uncompleted \u014cma line (as well as that of the uncompleted Toi line near [[Hakodate Main Line|Hakodate]]) but in 1968 the route was changed to the alignment subsequently built. Freight services ceased on the \u014chata line in 1979, and operation of it was transferred to [[Shimokita Koutsu]] in 1985. The line closed in 2001.\n\n==References==\nThis article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia.\n* ''JTB Timetable'' December 2010 issue\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ JR East website]\n\n{{commons category|\u014cminato Line}}\n\n{{East Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ominato Line}}\n[[Category:Rail transport in Aomori Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Lines of East Japan Railway Company]]\n[[Category:\u014cminato Line|*]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1921]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox rail line\n|name= \u014cminato Line\n| native_name = \u5927\u6e4a\u7dda\n| native_name_lang = ja\n| color       = 808080 <!-- Gray-->\n| logo        = \n| image       = JR East KiHa 100-205 Ominato Station 20091025.jpg\n| image_width = 300px\n| caption     = A KiHa 100 series DMU at Ominato Station on a ''Shimokita'' rapid service in October 2009\n|type=[[Heavy rail]]\n|start={{STN|Noheji}}\n|end={{STN|\u014cminato}}\n|stations=11\n|owner=[[East Japan Railway Company]]\n|operator=\n|open=1921\n|stock= [[KiHa 100 series]]\n|linelength= {{convert|58.4|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n|gauge= {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}}\n|electrification=none\n| map         = {{BS-map\n|map = \n{{BS||||[[Image:Arrow Blue Up 001.jpeg|10px|Up]][[Nambu J\u016bkan Railway]] (defunct)|}}\n{{BS2|exSTRl|exKBHFeq|||[[Image:Arrow Blue Left 001.jpeg|10px|Left]][[Aoimori Railway Line]][[Image:Arrow Blue Right 001.jpeg|10px|Right]]|}}\n{{BS2|ABZq+l|BHFq|0.0|{{STN|Noheji}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||2.8|{{STN|Kita-Noheji}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||9.6|{{STN|Arito}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||23.0|{{STN|Fukkoshi}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||30.1|{{STN|Mutsu-Yokohama}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||26.0|{{STN|Arihata}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||42.7|{{STN|Chikagawa}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||47.7|{{STN|Kanayasawa}}||}}\n{{BS2|BHF||53.2|{{STN|Akagawa}}||}}\n{{BS2|eABZg+r||||[[Image:Arrow Blue Left 001.jpeg|10px|Left]][[\u014chata Line]] (defunct)|}}\n{{BS2|BHF||55.5|{{STN|Shimokita}}||}}\n{{BS2|KBHFe||58.4|{{STN|\u014cminato}}|}}\n}}\n| map_state   = collapsed\n}}\n[[File:JR Ominato Line linemap.svg|thumb]]\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''\u014cminato Line'''|\u5927\u6e4a\u7dda|\u014cminato-sen}} is a railway route operated by [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East).

The line was extended to its present terminus of \u014cminato Station by September 25 1921. In 1922 the line was nationalised, and renamed the \u014cminato Line of the [[Japanese Government Railway]] (JGR, later [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]]).\n\nExpress ''Natsudomari'' operations began from [[Aomori Station]] on a seasonal basis in 1968. The express was later downgraded to rapid service and renamed the ''Usori'', and later the [[Shimokita (train)|''Shimokita'']]. All freight operations ceased on February 1 1984. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1 1984 the line came under the control of the East Japan Railway Company. On December 4 1999 a new [[centralized traffic control]] (CTC) system became operational. In 2002, seasonal excursion train ''Kirakira Michinoku'' operations commenced and a limited number of ''Shimokita'' trains were extended to terminate at [[Hachinohe Station]] instead of Noheji. The ''Shimokita'' service operates a daily round trip to Aomori and 3 round trips to Hachinohe in conjunction with the [[Aoimori Railway]].<ref name=\"Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jreast-timetable.jp/1802/train/015/016891.html|title=Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)|website=www.jreast.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nThe [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]], including Noheji was transferred from JR East to Aoimori Railway on December 4 2010 following the extension of the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] from Hachinohe to Shin-Aomori.<ref>Tetsudo Hobidas: [http://rail.hobidas.com/news/info/article/109792.html \"JR\u6771\u65e5\u672c \u6771\u5317\u672c\u7dda\u516b\u6238\u2015\u9752\u68ee\u9593\u306e\u5ec3\u6b62\u3092\u5c4a\u51fa \" (November 27, 2009)]. Retrieved February 7 2018. {{in lang|ja}}</ref> This resulted in the isolation of the \u014cminato Line, a branch of the T\u014dhoku Main Line,  from the rest of the JR East network with the exception of the ''Shimokita'' service from Aomori where it connects with the [[\u014cu Main Line]] and [[Tsugaru Line]].<ref name=\"Rapid (Ominato - Noheji - Aomori)\"/>\n\n===Former connecting lines===\n* Akagawa station - The Aomori Prefectural Government operated a 4km 762mm (2'6\") gauge line to Tanabu-Yanagicho between 1921 and 1941.\n\n* Shimokita station - A 18km line to Ohata ([[:ja:\u4e0b\u5317\u4ea4\u901a\u5927\u7551\u7dda|\u5927\u7551\u7dda]]) opened in 1939, and construction continued toward Oma to service a proposed naval base to protect the [[Tsugaru Strait]], and was well advanced when work was suspended in 1943 due to a shortage of materials. The [[Seikan Tunnel]] was originally proposed to utilise the roadbed of the uncompleted Oma line (as well as that of the uncompleted Toi line near [[Hakodate Main Line|Hakodate]]) but in 1968 the route was changed to the alignment subsequently built. Freight services ceased on the Ohata line in 1979, and operation of it was transferred to [[Shimokita Koutsu]] in 1985. The line closed in 2001.\n\n==References==\nThis article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia.\n* ''JTB Timetable'' December 2010 issue\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ JR East website]\n\n{{commons category|\u014cminato Line}}\n\n{{East Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ominato Line}}\n[[Category:Rail transport in Aomori Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Lines of East Japan Railway Company]]\n[[Category:\u014cminato Line|*]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1921]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Hms1103", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFormer connecting lines:Proper romanization for the Japanese letters \u304a\u304a", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cminato_Line"}

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R. I.|title=The Formation of a Persecuting Society|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, Massachusetts| edition=second|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4051-2964-0}}</ref> Concepts of heresy firmed up in Christian thought alongside concepts of orthodoxy.  Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].)

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

They began to harass the mercenaries and pilgrims of the crusader army. A brawl ensued. Soon the attackers from the town found themselves outnumbered and they retreated back into the town in disarray. The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians.

For the first time in history, Jews had to answer in public trial. There is no consensus in the sources as to who instigated the trial against the Talmud, but in June of 1239, [[Gregory IX]] (1237-1241) issued letters to various Archbishops and Kings across Europe to seize all Jewish books and take them to the Dominicans for examination.  The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

During [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], Christians considered [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Dissenter|dissent]] punishable offenses. However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by deists like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Contemporary Christians generally agree that heresy and dissent are not punishable offenses.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought.<ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\nConstantine used forced conversion and his Bishop Alcuin wrote him a rebuke against it.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200\u2013201}}\n\nThe crusades evidence a dramatic shift in Christian thought on tolerance and persecution.\n\n====High Middle Ages====\n\nFeudalism declined and persecution changed during the High Middle Ages as kings began centralizing power into themselves and the state.  Under feudalism, a noble Lord gave military support to his king, but when so many nobles sold or leased their land and left for the East on crusade, kings began building armies of mercenaries for themselves and taking over legal processes that had traditionally been local. This process led to the development of persecution of minorities between the tenth to the thirteenth centuries in Europe.<ref name =\"Moore\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=R.

Inquisitions were formed. The church began passing the punishment of heretics to the civil authorities who practiced corporal punishments and death.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] continued to pitch Christians and Muslims against each other in wars lasting into the late middle ages with massacres and atrocities on both sides.\n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nAfter the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and the later [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]]s in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were banned. This persecution only ended during the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century.\n\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to grant Muslims the right to freely practice their religion in 1492, this promise was frequently broken. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 the Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

Clouse:<ref name=\"Clouse\"/>{{rp|18}}<blockquote>It is clear from the crusades that what finally overpowered the early Christian teaching against violence was not merely a just war theory but rather a merger of violence and holiness at all levels of Christian life. ... The liturgy was expanded to include the blessing of weapons and standards. Knights were consecrated by ceremonies which were often a revival of old pagan customs.  There were new militant religious orders established such as the Templars who promised to fight the enemies of God in addition to taking the normal vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  When violence became sacred, the enemy was believed to be diabolical.  Thus the Turks were looked upon as opponents of the kingdom of God, a fulfillment of the forces of the antichrist as predicted in the book of Revelation.</blockquote>\n\nThis view of holiness and violence as merged in Christian thought is supported in Riley-Smith who says the crusades were products of the renewed spirituality of the central Middle Ages, with its concern for living the [[Vita apostolica|''vita apostolica'']] and expressing Christian ideals in active works of charity, exemplified by the new hospitals, the pastoral work of the Augustinians and Premonstratensians, and the service of the friars.

All the men who marched from town to town, burning, killing, raping and looting, were from northern France.  And, under law in the Middle Ages, the lands of defeated barons could be legally confiscated. Moore says the Pope supplied an excuse for something the king wanted anyway.

The mercenaries quickly took advantage of the chaos and followed their retreat, storming the walls of the city that were not yet properly manned. The walls were easily taken, and the mercenaries entered the gate, seemingly without orders from their leaders. The crusader knights, soon realizing that the defenses had been broken, joined the mercenaries in battle, easily overwhelming the town garrison. The mercenaries began  rampaging through the streets, killing and plundering, while those citizens who could run, sought refuge in the churches and cathedrals, but there was no safety from the raging mob of mercenaries.

The roles of evidence collector, prosecutor, and judge were combined in the inquisitor.  This inquisitorial process was in place when the Roman Empire converted to Christianity in the fourth century and it is the system that was revived in the middle ages. As a result, in his decretal of 1199, ''Vergentis in senium'', [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]] (1198\u20131216), took the crucial step of combining heresy with the Roman-law doctrine of ''l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9'', thereby accusing heretics of treason against God.<ref name=\"Monter\"/>\n\n===The Jews===\nIn the centuries after the fall of the Roman empire, Jews established small communities, engaged in commerce, and were seldom singled out as targets of verbal abuse or physical violence.<ref name=\"Berger\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=D|title=New Perspectives on Jewish-Christian Relations: In Honor of David Berger| year=2012|publisher=Brill|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-9-00422-117-8}}</ref>{{rp|2}}  However, historians agree that the eleventh to the thirteenth century was a turning point in Jewish-Christian relations.<blockquote> \"[[Bernard of Clairvaux]], (1090-1153) pillar of European monasticism and powerful twelfth century preacher, provides a perfect example of a Christian thinker balancing on a precipice, preaching hateful images of Jews at the same time as he sounded Scripture based admonitions that they must be protected despite their nature.<ref name=\"Berger\"/>{{rp|2}}</blockquote> Low level theological repartee had long existed between Jews and Christians.

The order was heeded only in Paris where, on June 25th, the Royal court was opened to hear the case. Eventually, each side claimed victory; a final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced until May of 1248, but the books had been burned six years before.<ref name=\"Rosenthal\">{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first= Judah M.|title=The Talmud on Trial: The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240|journal= The Jewish Quarterly Review|volume= 47| issue= 1|year= 1956|pages=58\u201376|publisher= JSTOR|doi= 10.2307/1453186|jstor= 1453186}}</ref>{{rp|68-72}}  \n\nAs a result of this trial, the people of Europe thought that, even if they had once had an obligation to preserve the Jews for the sake of the Old Testament, Talmudic Judaism was so different from its biblical sources that the old obligation no longer applied.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15</ref> The region's inhabitants resisted conquest, and, even once subjected, rebelled repeatedly in an effort to reject Christianity and reverse the conquest. As part of these campaigns, forced conversions were widespread; massacre and atrocity, combined with the capture and killing of hostages to compel surrender and conversion, were commonly used tactics.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

Medieval Germany: 1056-1273. Trans. Helga Braun and Richard Mortimer. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988. p.g. 157-158</ref> An example of how the use of forced conversion was justified, in the medieval Church, as compatible with previous Church doctrine on the subject can be found for instance in a statement made by [[Pope Innocent III]] in 1201 about those who agreed to be baptized to avoid torture and intimidation:\n\n<blockquote>[T]hose who are immersed even though reluctant, do belong to ecclesiastical jurisdiction at least by reason of the sacrament, and might therefore be reasonably compelled to observe the rules of the Christian Faith. It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= The English Reformation|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]]. Anglicans who argued against persecution were: [[John Locke]], [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]], [[Jeremy Taylor]],  [[Henry More]], [[John Tillotson]] and [[Gilbert Burnet]].<ref>This list is taken from: Coffey (2000), 50</ref>\n\nAll of these considered themselves Christians or were actual churchmen. John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.
