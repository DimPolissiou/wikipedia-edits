Faced with disappointment, the group changed direction from their [[science fiction]] themes and produced a more conceptual emotion-based third album in 1984 called ''[[The Story of a Young Heart]]'', with \"[[The More You Live, the More You Love]]\" as the lead single. Despite heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music video shows at that time, the single was only moderately successful, and the album's other two singles \u2013 \"Never Again (The Dancer)\" and \"Remember David\" (released only in a few European countries) \u2013 did not make any headway. Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction, the band continued to consider their options whilst touring.

In November 2003, the original lineup of Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series ''[[Bands Reunited]]''. In September 2004, they reformed again and did a brief tour in the United States. Though the tour continued to be advertised as the \"original lineup\", later shows no longer included the original band, but was Mike Score's continuation of the newer band; which by this point consisted of Score, Rodriguez, and new recruits Michael Brahm (drums), and Pando (bass guitar). In 2005, this version of the group starred in the American version of the entertainment show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby, One More Time]]'', where they performed \"I Ran\" and a cover of [[Ryan Cabrera]]'s song, \"[[On the Way Down|On The Way Down]]\" for a chance to have $20,000 donated to a charity of their choice.\n\nIn June 2011, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds performed at [[Croxteth Hall|Croxteth Park]] music festival in Liverpool, under the name 'A Flock of Seagulls'.<ref>{{cite web|title= 80's Band A Flock of Seagulls top Croxteth Free Music Festival lineup |website= LLTV |date= 25 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 August 2019 |url= http://liverpool-live.tv/uncategorized/80s-band-a-flock-of-seagulls-top-croxteth-free-music-festival-lineup/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Jade |last= Wright |title= Jade Wright recommends . . .Croxteth Park Free Music Festival |newspaper= [[Liverpool Echo]] |date= 10 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 August 2019 |url= https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music/jade-wright-recommends---3372111}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 February 2013, Mike Score indicated via his YouTube account that he was pursuing his solo career.

Despite heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music video shows at that time, the single was only moderately successful, and the album's other two singles \u2013 \"Never Again (The Dancer)\" and \"Remember David\" (released only in a few European countries) \u2013 did not make any headway. Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction, the band continued to consider their options whilst touring.

In September 2004, they reformed again and did a brief tour in the United States. Though the tour continued to be advertised as the \"original lineup\", later shows no longer included the original band, but was Mike Score's continuation of the newer band; which by this point consisted of Score, Rodriguez, and new recruits Michael Brahm (drums), and Pando (bass guitar).

Historically, they emerged from an amalgamation of two [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-speaking peoples, the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (or ''[[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]]'') in the 9th century. Later, the neighbouring Celtic-speaking [[Britons (historical)|Cumbrians]], as well as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], were incorporated into the Scottish nation.\n\nIn modern usage, \"Scottish people\" or \"Scots\" is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland.

Emigration, influenced by factors such as the [[Highland Clearances|Highland]] and [[Lowland Clearances]], Scottish participation in the [[British Empire]], and latterly [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and unemployment, have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world. Scottish emigrants took with them their [[Scottish languages]] and [[Scottish culture|culture]]. Large populations of Scottish people settled the new-world lands of [[North America|North]] and South America, Australia and [[New Zealand]].

[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxons, arrived beginning in the 7th century, while the Norse settled parts of Scotland from the 8th century onwards. In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], from the reign of [[David I of Scotland]], there was some emigration from France, England and the [[Low Countries]] to Scotland. Some famous Scottish family names, including those bearing names which became [[Bruce]], [[House of Balliol|Balliol]], [[Murray (surname)|Murray]] and [[Stewart (name)|Stewart]], came to Scotland at this time. Today, Scotland is the second-largest and second most-populous [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and the majority of people living there are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe highest concentrations of people of Scottish descent in the world outside of Scotland are located in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada, [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] in New Zealand, the [[Falklands Islands]], and [[Northern Ireland]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Ethnic groups of Scotland==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the British Isles|Prehistoric Scotland|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], Scotland saw several ethnic or cultural groups mentioned in contemporary sources, namely the [[Picts]], the [[Gaels]], the [[Brythons|Britons]], and the [[Angles]], with the last of these settling in the southeast of the country. Culturally, these peoples are grouped according to language. Most of Scotland until the 13th century spoke [[Celtic languages]], and these included, at least initially, the [[Brythons|Britons]], as well as the [[Gaels]] and the [[Picts]].<ref>Jackson, \"The Language of the Picts\", discussed by Forsyth, ''Language in Pictland''.</ref> [[Germanic peoples]] included the Angles of [[Northumbria]], who settled in south-eastern Scotland in the region between the [[Firth of Forth]] to the north and the [[River Tweed]] to the south. They also occupied the south-west of Scotland up to and including the Plain of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]]. Their language, [[Old English]], was the earliest form of the language which eventually became known as [[Scots language|Scots]].\n\nUse of the Gaelic language spread throughout nearly the whole of Scotland by the 9th century,<ref name=\"bord-na-gaidhlig1\">{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Thomas Owen|author-link=Thomas Owen Clancy|url=http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|title=Gaelic Scotland: a brief history|publisher=bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=21 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232223/http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|archivedate=11 September 2007}}</ref> reaching a peak in the 11th to 13th centuries, but was never the language of the south-east of the country.<ref name=\"bord-na-gaidhlig1\" /> [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] divided the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] between Scotland and England; at least, most medieval historians now accept the 'gift' by Edgar. In any case, after the later [[Battle of Carham]] the Scottish kingdom encompassed many English people, with even more quite possibly arriving after the [[Norman invasion of England]] in 1066. South-east of the [[Firth of Forth]], then in [[Lothian]] and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] ([[Old English language|OE:]] ''Lo\u00f0ene''), a northern variety of [[Old English language|Old English]], also known as [[Early Scots]], was spoken.\n\n[[File:St-Kildans.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kildans]] sitting on the village street, 1886]]\nAs a result of [[David I of Scotland|David I, King of Scots']] return from exile in England in 1113, ultimately to assume the throne in 1124 with the help of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] military force, David invited Anglo-Norman families from France and England to settle in lands he granted them to spread a ruling class loyal to him.<ref>Barrow, \"The Balance of New and Old\", p. 13.</ref> This [[Davidian Revolution]], as many historians call it, brought a European style of [[feudalism]] to Scotland along with an influx of people of French descent \u2013 by invitation, unlike [[Norman conquest of England|England]] where it was by conquest. To this day, many of the [[Scottish surnames|common family names of Scotland]] can trace ancestry to Normans from this period, such as the [[Stewart (name)|Stewarts]], the [[Bruce]]s, the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamiltons]], the [[Clan Wallace#Origins of the clan|Wallaces]] and the [[Melville (name)|Melvilles]].\n\nThe [[Northern Isles]] and some parts of [[Caithness]] were [[Norn language|Norn]]-speaking (the west of Caithness was Gaelic-speaking into the 20th century, as were some small communities in parts of the Central Highlands). From 1200 to 1500 the [[Early Scots]] language spread across the lowland parts of Scotland between [[Galloway]] and the Highland line, being used by [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] in his historical epic ''[[The Brus]]'' in the late 14th century in Aberdeen.\n\nFrom 1500 on, Scotland was commonly divided by language into two groups of people, [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic-speaking]] \"[[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]]s\" (the language formerly called Scottis by English speakers and known by many Lowlanders in the 18th century as \"Irish\") and the [[Early Scots|Inglis]]-speaking \"[[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlander]]s\" (a language later to be called [[Scots language|Scots]]).

There are some other minority languages of the Scottish people, such as Spanish, used by the population of Scots in [[Argentina]].\n\nThe [[Norn language]] was spoken in the [[Northern Isles]] into the early modern period \u2013 the current dialects of [[Shetlandic]] and Orcadian are heavily influenced by it, to this day.\n\nThere is still debate whether Scots is a dialect or a language in its own right, as there is no clear line to define the two. Scots is usually regarded as a midway between the two, as it is highly mutually intelligible with English, particularly the dialects spoken in the North of England as well as those spoken in Scotland, but is treated as a language in some laws.\n\n====Scottish English====\n{{Main|Scottish English}}\nAfter the [[Union of Crowns]] in 1603, the Scottish Court moved with [[James I of England|James VI & I]] to London and English vocabulary began to be used by the Scottish upper classes.<ref name=Crystal /> With the introduction of the [[printing press]], spellings became standardised. [[Scottish English]], a Scottish variation of southern [[English English]], began to replace the Scots language. Scottish English soon became the dominant language.

[[Scottish Gaelic]] comes from [[Old Irish]]. It was originally spoken by the [[Gaels]] of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and the [[Rhinns of Galloway]], later being adopted by the [[Pictish]] people of central and eastern Scotland. Gaelic (''lingua Scottica'', ''Scottis'') became the ''de facto'' language of the whole [[Kingdom of Alba]], giving its name to the country (''Scotia'', \"Scotland\"). Meanwhile, Gaelic independently spread from [[Galloway]] into [[Dumfriesshire]]. It is unclear if the Gaelic of 12th-century [[Clydesdale]] and [[Selkirkshire]] came from Galloway or other parts of Scotland. The predominance of Gaelic began to decline in the 13th century, and by the end of the Middle Ages, Scotland was divided into two linguistic zones, the English/Scots-speaking Lowlands and the Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Galloway. Gaelic continued to be spoken widely throughout the Highlands until the 19th century. The [[Highland clearances]] actively discouraged the use of Gaelic, and caused the numbers of Gaelic speakers to fall.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |last=Pagoeta\n  |first=Mikel Morris\n  |title=Europe Phrasebook\n  |publisher=Lonely Planet\n  |year=2001\n  |page=416\n  |isbn=978-1741799736}}</ref> Many Gaelic speakers emigrated to countries such as Canada or moved to the industrial cities of [[lowland Scotland]]. Communities where the language is still spoken natively are restricted to the west coast of Scotland; and especially the [[Hebrides]]. However, some Gaelic speakers also live in the cities of [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. A report in 2005 by the Registrar General for Scotland based on the [[2001 UK Census]] showed about 92,400 people or 1.9% of the population can speak Gaelic, while the number of people able to read and write it rose by 7.5% and 10% respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/4326424.stm |title=UK &#124; Mixed report on Gaelic language |work=BBC News|date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> Outwith Scotland, there are communities of Scottish Gaelic speakers such as the [[Canadian Gaelic]] community; though their numbers have also been declining rapidly. Gaelic language is recognised as a minority language by the [[European Union]]. The [[Scottish parliament]] is also seeking to increase the use of Gaelic in Scotland through the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]]. Gaelic is now used as a first language in some schools and is prominently seen in use on [[Gaelic road signs in Scotland|dual language road signs]] throughout the Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland. It is recognised as an official language of Scotland with \"equal respect\" to English.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Religion in Scotland}}\nThe modern people of Scotland remain a mix of different religions and no religion.

This reflected the gradual spread of English, initially in the form of [[Early Scots]], from around the 13th century onwards, through Scotland beyond its traditional area in the Lothians. It also reflected some deliberate political attempts{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} to promote the English language in the outlying regions of Scotland, including following the Union of the Crowns under King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1603, and then the [[Acts of Union of 1707]] and the subsequent defeat of rebellions.{{who|date=December 2016}}\n\nHowever, many Scottish surnames have remained predominantly [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] albeit written according to English [[orthography|orthographic]] practice (as with Irish surnames). Thus ''MacAoidh'' in Gaelic is ''Mackay'' in English, and ''MacGill-Eain'' in Gaelic is ''MacLean'' and so on. ''Mac'' (sometimes ''Mc'') is common as, effectively, it means \"son of\". ''MacDonald'', ''MacDougal'', ''MacAulay'', ''Gilmore'', ''Gilmour'', ''MacKinley'', ''Macintosh'', ''MacKenzie'', ''MacNeill'', ''MacPherson'', ''MacLear'', ''MacAra'', ''Bruce'', ''Campbell'', ''Fraser'', ''Oliver'', ''Craig'', ''Lauder'', ''Menzies'', ''Stewart'', ''Galloway'' and ''Duncan'' are just a few of many examples of traditional Scottish surnames. There are, of course, also the many surnames, like ''Wallace'' and ''Morton'', stemming from parts of Scotland which were settled by peoples other than the [[Scoti|(Gaelic) Scots]]. The most common surnames in Scotland are ''Smith'' and ''Brown'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/births/popular-names/archive/100-most-common-surnames|title=100 Most Common Surnames|work=National Records of Scotland|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> which each come from more than one origin: e.g. Smith might be a translation of Mac a' Ghobhainn (thence also e.g. MacGowan), and Brown can refer to the colour, or be akin to MacBrayne.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAnglicisation is not restricted to language. In his ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, future British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] wrote: \"The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past, and, being\ndeprived of the inspiration of its nationality, is also deprived of its communal sense.\"<ref name=\"MacDonald1921\">{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|authorlink=Ramsay MacDonald|title=Socialism: Critical and Constructive|chapter-url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/download/SocialismCriticalandConstructive_10094299.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2016|year=1921|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|page=249|chapter=CHAPTER VI Political Construction: The Democratic State}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{See also|Scotia}}\n\nOriginally the Romans used Scotia to refer to the Gaels living in Ireland.<ref name=\"Lehane1994\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Lehane\n|first=Brendan\n|title=The Quest of Three Abbots: The Golden Age of Celtic Christianity\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTT8WOnWl7wC\n|year=1994\n|publisher=SteinerBooks\n|isbn=978-0-940262-65-2\n|page=121\n}}\n</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} [[Bede|The Venerable Bede]] (c. 672 or 673 \u2013 27 May, 735) uses the word ''Scottorum'' for the nation from Ireland who settled part of the [[Pictish]] lands: \"''Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit''.\"  This we can infer to mean the arrival of the people, also known as the [[Gaels]], in the Kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata, in the western edge of Scotland.

Historically, they emerged from an amalgamation of two [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-speaking peoples, the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels]], who founded the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (or ''[[Kingdom of Alba|Alba]]'') in the 9th century. Later, the neighbouring Celtic-speaking [[Britons (historical)|Cumbrians]], as well as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking [[Anglo-Saxons]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]], were incorporated into the Scottish nation.\n\nIn modern usage, \"Scottish people\" or \"Scots\" is used to refer to anyone whose linguistic, cultural, family ancestral or genetic origins are from Scotland.

Emigration, influenced by factors such as the [[Highland Clearances|Highland]] and [[Lowland Clearances]], Scottish participation in the [[British Empire]], and latterly [[deindustrialization|industrial decline]] and unemployment, have resulted in Scottish people being found throughout the world. Scottish emigrants took with them their [[Scottish languages]] and [[Scottish culture|culture]]. Large populations of Scottish people settled the new-world lands of [[North America|North]] and South America, Australia and [[New Zealand]].

[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxons, arrived beginning in the 7th century, while the Norse settled parts of Scotland from the 8th century onwards. In the [[Scotland in the High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]], from the reign of [[David I of Scotland]], there was some emigration from France, England and the [[Low Countries]] to Scotland. Some famous Scottish family names, including those bearing names which became [[Bruce]], [[House of Balliol|Balliol]], [[Murray (surname)|Murray]] and [[Stewart (name)|Stewart]], came to Scotland at this time. Today, Scotland is the second-largest and second most-populous [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and the majority of people living there are [[British nationality law|British citizens]].\n\nThe highest concentrations of people of Scottish descent in the world outside of Scotland are located in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] in Canada, [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] in New Zealand, the [[Falklands Islands]], and [[Northern Ireland]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Ethnic groups of Scotland==\n{{Further|Genetic history of the British Isles|Prehistoric Scotland|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], Scotland saw several ethnic or cultural groups mentioned in contemporary sources, namely the [[Picts]], the [[Gaels]], the [[Brythons|Britons]], and the [[Angles]], with the last of these settling in the southeast of the country. Culturally, these peoples are grouped according to language. Most of Scotland until the 13th century spoke [[Celtic languages]], and these included, at least initially, the [[Brythons|Britons]], as well as the [[Gaels]] and the [[Picts]].<ref>Jackson, \"The Language of the Picts\", discussed by Forsyth, ''Language in Pictland''.</ref> [[Germanic peoples]] included the Angles of [[Northumbria]], who settled in south-eastern Scotland in the region between the [[Firth of Forth]] to the north and the [[River Tweed]] to the south. They also occupied the south-west of Scotland up to and including the Plain of [[Kyle, Ayrshire|Kyle]]. Their language, [[Old English]], was the earliest form of the language which eventually became known as [[Scots language|Scots]].\n\nUse of the Gaelic language spread throughout nearly the whole of Scotland by the 9th century,<ref name=\"bord-na-gaidhlig1\">{{cite web|last=Clancy|first=Thomas Owen|author-link=Thomas Owen Clancy|url=http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|title=Gaelic Scotland: a brief history|publisher=bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk|date=13 July 2006|accessdate=21 September 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232223/http://www.bord-na-gaidhlig.org.uk/about-gaelic/history.html|archivedate=11 September 2007}}</ref> reaching a peak in the 11th to 13th centuries, but was never the language of the south-east of the country.<ref name=\"bord-na-gaidhlig1\"/> [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] divided the [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] between Scotland and England; at least, most medieval historians now accept the 'gift' by Edgar. In any case, after the later [[Battle of Carham]] the Scottish kingdom encompassed many English people, with even more quite possibly arriving after the [[Norman invasion of England]] in 1066. South-east of the [[Firth of Forth]], then in [[Lothian]] and the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] ([[Old English language|OE:]] ''Lo\u00f0ene''), a northern variety of [[Old English language|Old English]], also known as [[Early Scots]], was spoken.\n\n[[File:St-Kildans.jpg|thumb|right|[[St Kilda, Scotland|St. Kildans]] sitting on the village street, 1886]]\nAs a result of [[David I of Scotland|David I, King of Scots']] return from exile in England in 1113, ultimately to assume the throne in 1124 with the help of [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] military force, David invited Anglo-Norman families from France and England to settle in lands he granted them to spread a ruling class loyal to him.<ref>Barrow, \"The Balance of New and Old\", p. 13.</ref> This [[Davidian Revolution]], as many historians call it, brought a European style of [[feudalism]] to Scotland along with an influx of people of French descent \u2013 by invitation, unlike [[Norman conquest of England|England]] where it was by conquest. To this day, many of the [[Scottish surnames|common family names of Scotland]] can trace ancestry to Normans from this period, such as the [[Stewart (name)|Stewarts]], the [[Bruce]]s, the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamiltons]], the [[Clan Wallace#Origins of the clan|Wallaces]] and the [[Melville (name)|Melvilles]].\n\nThe [[Northern Isles]] and some parts of [[Caithness]] were [[Norn language|Norn]]-speaking (the west of Caithness was Gaelic-speaking into the 20th century, as were some small communities in parts of the Central Highlands). From 1200 to 1500 the [[Early Scots]] language spread across the lowland parts of Scotland between [[Galloway]] and the Highland line, being used by [[John Barbour (poet)|Barbour]] in his historical epic ''[[The Brus]]'' in the late 14th century in Aberdeen.\n\nFrom 1500 on, Scotland was commonly divided by language into two groups of people, [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic-speaking]] \"[[Scottish Highlands|Highlander]]s\" (the language formerly called Scottis by English speakers and known by many Lowlanders in the 18th century as \"Irish\") and the [[Early Scots|Inglis]]-speaking \"[[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlander]]s\" (a language later to be called [[Scots language|Scots]]).

After the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|wars of independence]], the English used by Lowland Scots speakers evolved in a different direction from that of Modern [[English language in England|English]]. Since 1424, this language, known to its speakers as ''Inglis'', was used by the [[Scottish Parliament]] in its statutes.<ref name=Crystal>{{Cite book\n  |last=Crystal\n  |first=David\n  |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language\n  |publisher=Cambridge University Press\n  |date=25 August 2003\n  |id=ISBN}}</ref> By the middle of the 15th century, the language's name had changed from ''Inglis'' to ''Scottis''.

[[Scottish Gaelic]] comes from [[Old Irish]]. It was originally spoken by the [[Gaels]] of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] and the [[Rhinns of Galloway]], later being adopted by the [[Pictish]] people of central and eastern Scotland. Gaelic (''lingua Scottica'', ''Scottis'') became the ''de facto'' language of the whole [[Kingdom of Alba]], giving its name to the country (''Scotia'', \"Scotland\"). Meanwhile, Gaelic independently spread from [[Galloway]] into [[Dumfriesshire]]. It is unclear if the Gaelic of 12th-century [[Clydesdale]] and [[Selkirkshire]] came from Galloway or other parts of Scotland. The predominance of Gaelic began to decline in the 13th century, and by the end of the Middle Ages, Scotland was divided into two linguistic zones, the English/Scots-speaking Lowlands and the Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Galloway. Gaelic continued to be spoken widely throughout the Highlands until the 19th century. The [[Highland clearances]] actively discouraged the use of Gaelic, and caused the numbers of Gaelic speakers to fall.<ref>{{Cite book\n  |last=Pagoeta\n  |first=Mikel Morris\n  |title=Europe Phrasebook\n  |publisher=Lonely Planet\n  |year=2001\n  |page=416\n  |isbn=978-1741799736}}</ref> Many Gaelic speakers emigrated to countries such as Canada or moved to the industrial cities of [[lowland Scotland]]. Communities where the language is still spoken natively are restricted to the west coast of Scotland; and especially the [[Hebrides]]. However, some Gaelic speakers also live in the cities of [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. A report in 2005 by the Registrar General for Scotland based on the [[2001 UK Census]] showed about 92,400 people or 1.9% of the population can speak Gaelic, while the number of people able to read and write it rose by 7.5% and 10% respectively.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/scotland/4326424.stm |title=UK &#124; Mixed report on Gaelic language |work=BBC News|date=10 October 2005 |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> Outwith Scotland, there are communities of Scottish Gaelic speakers such as the [[Canadian Gaelic]] community; though their numbers have also been declining rapidly. Gaelic language is recognised as a minority language by the [[European Union]]. The [[Scottish parliament]] is also seeking to increase the use of Gaelic in Scotland through the [[Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005]]. Gaelic is now used as a first language in some schools and is prominently seen in use on [[Gaelic road signs in Scotland|dual language road signs]] throughout the Gaelic speaking parts of Scotland. It is recognised as an official language of Scotland with \"equal respect\" to English.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Religion in Scotland}}\nThe modern people of Scotland remain a mix of different religions and no religion.

This reflected the gradual spread of English, initially in the form of [[Early Scots]], from around the 13th century onwards, through Scotland beyond its traditional area in the Lothians. It also reflected some deliberate political attempts{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} to promote the English language in the outlying regions of Scotland, including following the Union of the Crowns under King [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]] in 1603, and then the [[Acts of Union of 1707]] and the subsequent defeat of rebellions.{{who|date=December 2016}}\n\nHowever, many Scottish surnames have remained predominantly [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] albeit written according to English [[orthography|orthographic]] practice (as with Irish surnames). Thus ''MacAoidh'' in Gaelic is ''Mackay'' in English, and ''MacGill-Eain'' in Gaelic is ''MacLean'' and so on. ''Mac'' (sometimes ''Mc'') is common as, effectively, it means \"son of\". ''MacDonald'', ''MacDougal'', ''MacAulay'', ''Gilmore'', ''Gilmour'', ''MacKinley'', ''Macintosh'', ''MacKenzie'', ''MacNeill'', ''MacPherson'', ''MacLear'', ''MacAra'', ''Bruce'', ''Campbell'', ''Fraser'', ''Oliver'', ''Craig'', ''Lauder'', ''Menzies'', ''Stewart'', ''Galloway'' and ''Duncan'' are just a few of many examples of traditional Scottish surnames. There are, of course, also the many surnames, like ''Wallace'' and ''Morton'', stemming from parts of Scotland which were settled by peoples other than the [[Scoti|(Gaelic) Scots]]. The most common surnames in Scotland are ''Smith'' and ''Brown'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/births/popular-names/archive/100-most-common-surnames|title=100 Most Common Surnames|work=National Records of Scotland|date=25 September 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> which each come from more than one origin: e.g. Smith might be a translation of Mac a' Ghobhainn (thence also e.g. MacGowan), and Brown can refer to the colour, or be akin to MacBrayne.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAnglicisation is not restricted to language. In his ''Socialism: critical and constructive'', published in 1921, future British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] wrote: \"The Anglification of Scotland has been proceeding apace to the damage of its education, its music, its literature, its genius, and the generation that is growing up under this influence is uprooted from its past, and, being\ndeprived of the inspiration of its nationality, is also deprived of its communal sense.\"<ref name=\"MacDonald1921\">{{cite book|last=MacDonald|first=James Ramsay|authorlink=Ramsay MacDonald|title=Socialism: Critical and Constructive|chapter-url=https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/download/SocialismCriticalandConstructive_10094299.pdf|accessdate=12 July 2016|year=1921|publisher=Cassell and Company Ltd|page=249|chapter=CHAPTER VI Political Construction: The Democratic State}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{See also|Scotia}}\n\nOriginally the Romans used Scotia to refer to the Gaels living in Ireland.<ref name=\"Lehane1994\">\n{{cite book\n|last=Lehane\n|first=Brendan\n|title=The Quest of Three Abbots: The Golden Age of Celtic Christianity\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PTT8WOnWl7wC\n|year=1994\n|publisher=SteinerBooks\n|isbn=978-0-940262-65-2\n|page=121\n}}\n</ref>{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} [[Bede|The Venerable Bede]] (c. 672 or 673 \u2013 27 May, 735) uses the word ''Scottorum'' for the nation from Ireland who settled part of the [[Pictish]] lands: \"''Scottorum nationem in Pictorum parte recipit''.\"  This we can infer to mean the arrival of the people, also known as the [[Gaels]], in the Kingdom of D\u00e1l Riata, in the western edge of Scotland.
