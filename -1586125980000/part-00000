In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop.

In the end, all three competitors, who were atop ladders, managed to unhook the gold hook with the titles still intact. After a scuffle, Jimmy and Kingston performed a headbutt on Morrison, who fell down atop a ladder wedged between the rope and a second ladder.

The match ended via a disqualification win for Owens, as Rollins attacked him with the ring bell. Owens then taunted Rollins to face him again in a [[no disqualification match]], which was accepted.

A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match.

{"title_page": "Radio-frequency identification", "text_new": "{{short description|Technology using electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects}}\n{{Redirect|Gen 2|the related terms|Second generation (disambiguation)}}\n'''Radio-frequency identification''' ('''RFID''') uses [[electromagnetic field]]s to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects.  An RFID tag consists of a tiny radio transponder; a radio receiver and transmitter.  When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.  This number can be used to inventory goods.  There are two types.  ''Passive tags'' are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating [[radio wave]]s.  ''Active tags'' are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader; up to hundreds of meters.  Unlike a [[barcode]], the tag doesn't need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).<ref>[http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505190510/http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification |date=May 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRFID tags are used in many industries. For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and [[Microchip implant (animal)|implanting RFID microchips]] in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.\n\nSince RFID tags can be attached to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.<ref name=\"Angell\">{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=90\u201396 |title=RFID and the end of cash? |author=Angell, I., Kietzmann, J. |doi=10.1145/1183236.1183237 |url=http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224155226/http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues.  [[ISO/IEC 18000]] and ISO/IEC 29167 use on-chip [[cryptography]] methods for untraceability, tag and reader [[authentication]], and over-the-air privacy. [[ISO/IEC 20248]] specifies a [[digital signature]] data structure for RFID and [[barcodes]] providing data, source and read method authenticity.  This work is done within [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31 Automatic identification and data capture techniques]]. Tags can also be used in shops to expedite checkout, and to prevent theft by customers and employees.\n\nIn 2014, the world RFID market was worth US$8.89 billion, up from US$7.77 billion in 2013 and US$6.96 billion in 2012. This figure includes tags, readers, and software/services for RFID cards, labels, fobs, and all other form factors.

The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.\n\nRFID tags can be either passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an on-board battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than an active tag for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.\n\nTags may either be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user. Field programmable tags may be write-once, read-multiple; \"blank\" tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user.\n\nThe RFID tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.\n\n===Readers===\n\nRFID systems can be classified by the type of tag and reader. A '''Passive Reader Active Tag''' ('''PRAT''') system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The reception range of a PRAT system reader can be adjusted from {{convert|1|-|2000|ft|-2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-do-rfid-tags-work/|title=How Does RFID Technology Work?|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>, allowing flexibility in applications such as asset protection and supervision.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Passive Tag''' ('''ARPT''') system has an active reader, which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Active Tag''' ('''ARAT''') system uses active tags awoken with an interrogator signal from the active reader. A variation of this system could also use a Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag's return reporting signal.\n\nFixed readers are set up to create a specific interrogation zone which can be tightly controlled. This allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone.

Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away. In this [[Near and far field|near field]] region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can [[backscatter]] a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.<ref name=Dobkin08>Daniel M. Dobkin, ''The RF in RFID: Passive UHF RFID In Practice'', Newnes 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8209-1}}, chapter 8</ref>\n\nAn [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) is one common type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag contains a 96-bit string of data.  The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages the data for this tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]], the total electronic product code number can be used as a key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.<ref>John R. Vacca ''Computer and information security handbook'', Morgan Kaufmann, 2009 {{ISBN|0-12-374354-0}}, page 208</ref>\n\nOften more than one tag will respond to a tag reader, for example, many individual products with tags may be shipped in a common box or on a common pallet. Collision detection is important to allow reading of data.  Two different types of protocols are used to [[Singulation|\"singulate\"]] a particular tag, allowing its data to be read in the midst of many similar tags.  In a [[ALOHAnet|slotted Aloha]] system, the reader broadcasts an initialization command and a parameter that the tags individually use to pseudo-randomly delay their responses. When using an \"adaptive binary tree\" protocol, the reader sends an initialization symbol and then transmits one bit of ID data at a time; only tags with matching bits respond, and eventually only one tag matches the complete ID string.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt ,''RFID essentials'',  O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}}, pages 88\u201389</ref>\n[[File:RFID search environment.png|thumb|right|An example of a binary tree method of identifying an RFID tag]]\nBoth methods have drawbacks when used with many tags or with multiple overlapping readers.\n\n===Bulk reading===\n\"Bulk reading\" is a strategy for interrogating multiple tags at the same time, but lacks sufficient precision for inventory control.  A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. Bulk reading is a possible use of [[High frequency|HF]] (ISO 18000-3), [[UHF]] (ISO 18000-6) and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] (ISO 18000-4) RFID tags. However, as tags respond strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs|title=Frequently Asked Questions - RFID Journal|website=www.rfidjournal.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nA group of tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility; if any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. The response conditions for inductively coupled [[High frequency|HF]] RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.\n\nUnder operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management. However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, a bunch of RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a [[Fuzzy mathematics|fuzzy]] method for process support. From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.com/files/SGTF_Report_Final_posted_v1.1.pdf|title=STGF Report}}</ref>\n\n===Miniaturization===\nRFID tags are easy to conceal or incorporate in other items.

It can be made out of copper, aluminum, or silver strips. The antenna can take different shapes: a spiral, a single [[dipole antenna]], two dipoles with one dipole perpendicular to another, or a folded dipole. The antenna length and geometry depends on the frequency at which the tag operates.<ref name=\"constr\"/> \n\nChip and antenna are embedded onto a thin plastic substrate of 100 to 200 nm, for example polymer, PVC, Polyethylenetherephtalate (PET), phenolics, polyesters, styrene, or paper via copper etching or [[hot stamping]].

The tag can be read if passed near a reader, even if it is covered by the object or not visible. The tag can be read inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can be read hundreds at a time. Bar codes can only be read one at a time using current devices.\n\nIn 2011, the cost of passive tags started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or withstand gamma sterilization, can go up to US$5. Active tags for tracking containers, medical assets, or monitoring environmental conditions in data centers start at US$50 and can go up over US$100 each. Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tags are in the US$3\u201310 range and also have sensor capability like temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eptls.org/rfid.html|title=EPTLS {{!}} The Electronic Product Tag & Labelling Scheme|website=eptls.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nRFID can be used in a variety of applications,<ref>{{cite web|author=Martein Meints|date=June 2007|title= D3.7 A Structured Collection on Information and Literature on Technological and Usability Aspects of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), FIDIS deliverable 3(7)|url=http://www.fidis.net/resources/deliverables/hightechid/#c1782|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paolo Magrassi|author-link=Paolo Magrassi|year=2001|url=http://www.gartner.com|title=A World Of Smart Objects: The Role Of Auto Identification Technologies|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> such as:\n\n[[File:RFkey.jpg|thumb|Electronic key for RFID based lock system]]\n* Access management\n* Tracking of goods\n* Tracking of persons and animals<ref>Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., & Lucas, M.

The tag can contain identifying information or may just be a key into a database. An RFID system may replace or supplement bar codes and may offer another method of inventory management and self-service checkout by patrons. It can also act as a [[security]] device, taking the place of the more traditional [[electronic article surveillance|electromagnetic security strip]].<ref name=\"butters\">{{cite journal |last1=Butters |first1=Alan |title=Radio Frequency Identification: An Introduction for Library Professionals |journal=Australasian Public Libraries and Information Services |volume=19 |issue=4 | date=December 2006 |pages=164\u201374 |url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=312996058408409;res=IELHSS |issn=1030-5033}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that over 30 million library items worldwide now contain RFID tags, including some in the [[Vatican Library]] in [[Rome]].<ref name=\"singh\">{{cite journal |doi=10.6017/ital.v25i1.3326 |title=The State of RFID Applications in Libraries |year=2013 |last1=Sing |first1=Jay |last2=Brar |first2=Navjit |last3=Fong |first3=Carmen |journal=Information Technology and Libraries |volume=25\u201332|page=24 }}</ref>\n\nSince RFID tags can be read through an item, there is no need to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, and a stack of books can be read simultaneously.  Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a [[conveyor belt]], which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Radio Frequency Identification |first1=Rachel |last1=Wadham |journal=Library Mosaics |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=2003 |page=22}}</ref>\nHowever, as of 2008 this technology remained too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period has been estimated at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of \u20ac50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off,<ref name=\"singh\"/> but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation to compensate for the reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.\n\nPrivacy concerns have been raised surrounding library use of RFID. Because some RFID tags can be read from up to {{convert|100|m}}, there is some concern over whether sensitive information could be collected from an unwilling source. However, library RFID tags do not contain any patron information,<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Dorman |title=RFID Poses No Problem for Patron Privacy |journal=American Libraries |volume=34 |issue=11 | date=December 2003 |page=86 |url=http://www.ala.org/PrinterTemplate.cfm?section=archive&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=50931}}</ref> and the tags used in the majority of libraries use a frequency only readable from approximately {{convert|10|ft}}.<ref name=\"butters\"/> Further, another non-library agency could potentially record the RFID tags of every person leaving the library without the library administrator's knowledge or consent. One simple option is to let the book transmit a code that has meaning only in conjunction with the library's database. Another possible enhancement would be to give each book a new code every time it is returned. In future, should readers become ubiquitous (and possibly networked), then stolen books could be traced even outside the library. Tag removal could be made difficult if the tags are so small that they fit invisibly inside a (random) page, possibly put there by the publisher.\n\n====Museums====\nRFID technologies are now also implemented in end-user applications in museums. An example was the custom-designed temporary research application, \"eXspot,\" at the [[Exploratorium]], a science museum in [[San Francisco, California]]. A visitor entering the museum received an RF Tag that could be carried as a card. The eXspot system enabled the visitor to receive information about specific exhibits. Aside from the exhibit information, the visitor could take photographs of themselves at the exhibit. It was also intended to allow the visitor to take data for later analysis. The collected information could be retrieved at home from a \"personalized\" website keyed to the RFID tag.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1081992.1082021 |title=RFID enhances visitors' museum experience at the Exploratorium |year=2005 |last1=Hsi |first1=Sherry |last2=Fait |first2=Holly |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=60\u20135}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and universities====\nSchool authorities in the Japanese city of [[Osaka]] are now chipping children's clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school.<ref name=LAN>{{cite web|url=http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |title=Schoolchildren to be RFID-chipped |publisher=Networks.silicon.com |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427003216/http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}</ref> A school in [[Doncaster]], [[England]] is piloting a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/kid_chipping_doncaster_go/ |title=Schoolkid chipping trial 'a success' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref> [[List of further education colleges in England#S|St Charles Sixth Form College]] in west [[London]], England, started in 2008, uses an RFID card system to check in and out of the main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance. Similarly, [[Whitcliffe Mount School]] in [[Cleckheaton]], England uses RFID to track pupils and staff in and out of the building via a specially designed card. In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books. Gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a school shop and canteen. RFID is also used in the library, and to sign in and out for student and teacher attendance.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:2008 Nike+ Human Race in Taipei the ChampionChip.jpg|thumb|ChampionChip]]\n[[Transponder timing|RFID for timing races]] began in the early 1990s with pigeon racing, introduced by the company [[Deister Electronics]] in Germany. RFID can provide race start and end timings for individuals in large races where it is impossible to get accurate stopwatch readings for every entrant.\n\nIn the race, the racers wear tags that are read by antennas placed alongside the track or on mats across the track. UHF tags provide accurate readings with specially designed antennas. Rush error, lap count errors and accidents at start time are avoided since anyone can start and finish any time without being in a batch mode.\n[[File:Marathon Zeitnahme.JPG|thumb|left|[[jchip|J-Chip]] 8-channel receiver next to timing mat. The athlete wears a chip on a strap around his ankle. [https://web.archive.org/web/19961218232821/http://www.ironman.de/ Ironman Germany] 2007 in Frankfurt.]]\n\nThe design of chip+antenna controls the range from which it can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe or velcro strapped to the ankle. These need to be about 400mm from the mat and so give very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (125mm square) antenna can be incorporated into the bib number worn on the athlete's chest at about 1.25m height.\n\nPassive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as [[Orienteering]], [[Enduro]] and [[Hare and Hound (Motorcycle Race)|Hare and Hounds]] racing. Riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.\n\nRFID is being adapted by many recruitment agencies which have a PET (physical endurance test) as their qualifying procedure, especially in cases where the candidate volumes may run into millions (Indian Railway recruitment cells, police and power sector).\n\nA number of [[ski resort]]s have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers hands-free access to [[ski lift]]s. Skiers do not have to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 megahertz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix, use these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cliqology.com/2010/09/epic-mix-skiiers-and-snowboards-social-media-dream/ |title=Epic Mix \u2013 Skiiers [sic] and Snowboarders Social Media Dream |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |title=Vail Resorts Launches Epic Mix &#124; SNOWBOARD MAGAZINE |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904085254/http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |accessdate=2020-03-01|archive-date=2010-09-04 }}</ref><ref>Kinsella, Bret.

They may never completely replace barcodes, due in part to their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, ''e.g.'' via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline [[boarding passes]]. The new [[Electronic Product Code|EPC]], along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.\n\nThe storage of data associated with tracking items will require many [[terabyte]]s. Filtering and categorizing RFID data is needed to create useful information. It is likely that goods will be tracked by the pallet using RFID tags, and at package level with Universal Product Code ([[Universal Product Code|UPC]]) or [[European Article Number|EAN]] from unique barcodes.\n\nThe unique identity is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special choice of the numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft and other forms of product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that is well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.\n\n===Waste management===\nRFID use has recently developed in the [[waste management]] industry. RFID tags are installed on waste collection carts, linking carts to the owner's account for easy billing and service verification. The tag is embedded into a garbage and recycle container, and the RFID reader is affixed to the garbage and recycle trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste360.com/route-optimization/rfid-still-early-stages-adoption-waste-industry|title=RFID Still In Early Stages of Adoption by Waste Industry|last=|first=|date=2016-08-10|website=|access-date=}}</ref> RFID also measures a customer's set-out rate and provides insight as to the number of carts serviced by each waste collection vehicle. This RFID process replaces traditional \"[[pay as you throw]]\" (PAYT) [[municipal solid waste]] usage-pricing models.\n\n===Telemetry===\nActive RFID tags have the potential to function as low-cost remote sensors that broadcast [[telemetry]] back to a base station. Applications of tagometry data could include sensing of road conditions by implanted [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|beacons]], weather reports, and noise level monitoring.<ref>{{ISSN search link|0001-0782}}</ref>\n\nPassive RFID tags can also report sensor data.

Two tag air interfaces (the protocol for exchanging information between a tag and a reader) were defined (but not ratified) by EPCglobal prior to 2003.

A large amount of data may be generated that is not useful for managing inventory or other applications. For example, a customer moving a product from one shelf to another, or a pallet load of articles that passes several readers while being moved in a warehouse, are events that do not produce data that are meaningful to an inventory control system.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt, ''RFID Essentials'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}} page 43</ref>\n\nEvent filtering is required to reduce this data inflow to a meaningful depiction of moving goods passing a threshold. Various concepts{{Examples|date=June 2010}} have been designed, mainly offered as ''[[middleware]]'' performing the filtering from noisy and redundant raw data to significant processed data.\n\n===Global standardization===\nThe frequencies used for UHF RFID in the USA are as of 2007 incompatible with those of Europe or Japan. Furthermore, no emerging standard has yet become as universal as the [[barcode]].<ref>{{cite news|date = 7 June 2007|title = Radio Silence|url = http://economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9249278|newspaper = The Economist}}</ref> To address international trade concerns, it is necessary to use a tag that is operational within all of the international frequency domains.\n\n===Security concerns===\nA primary RFID security concern is the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised with respect to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s recent adoption of RFID tags for [[supply chain management]].<ref>{{cite web|work = Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)|title = What's New|date = 4 April 2007|url = http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228101133/http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|archivedate = 28 February 2006}}</ref> More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to [[RFID skimming|skimming]] and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.<ref name=Hancke>{{cite journal|last=Hancke|first=Gerhard P|title=Practical eavesdropping and skimming attacks on high-frequency RFID tokens|journal=Journal of Computer Security|year=2011|volume=19|issue=2|pages=259\u2013288|doi=10.3233/JCS-2010-0407|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527141257/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|archivedate=27 May 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9341}}</ref>\n\nA second method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a [[cryptographic]]ally coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be [[symmetric key cryptography|symmetric]], or may use [[public key cryptography]].<ref name=RFIDHbook1>{{cite book|last=Ilyas|first=edited by Syed Ahson, Mohammad|title=RFID handbook : applications, technology, security, and privacy|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781420054996|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4aCyZnq0cwC&pg=PA478&lpg=PA478&dq=Rather,+the+reader+issues+a+challenge+to+the+tag,+which+responds+with+a+result+computed+using+a+cryptographic+circuit+keyed+with+some+secret+value&source=bl&ots=nL2ORy_M-7&sig=mo9QSZyOeEEwnO9xqgAAg5cnx08&hl=en&sa=X&ei=82YhUIjwGeWg0QXp6oDwBQ&ved=0CGMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Rather%2C%20the%20reader%20issues%20a%20challenge%20to%20the%20tag%2C%20which%20responds%20with%20a%20result%20computed%20using%20a%20cryptographic%20circuit%20keyed%20with%20some%20secret%20value&f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|accessdate=7 August 2012|page=478|chapter=26.5}}</ref>\n\nUnauthorized reading of RFID tags presents a risk to privacy and to business secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/proceedings-en/453168007.html|title=Business risks from naive use of RFID in tracking, tracing and logistics - Conference papers - VDE Publishing House|website=www.vde-verlag.de|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Unauthorized readers can potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or the contents of a package.<ref name=RFIDHbook1/> Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|title = RFID Privacy and Security|publisher = RSA Laboratories|accessdate = 2013-09-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061218210709/http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|archivedate = 2006-12-18}}</ref> as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://avoine.net/rfid/|title = RFID Security and Privacy Lounge|publisher=Avoine.net|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> There are also concerns that the database structure of [[Object Naming Service]] may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to [[denial-of-service attack]]s, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Adi|last=Tedjasaputra|url=http://www.rfid-asia.info/2007/02/putting-rfid-network-security-in.htm|title=Putting RFID Network Security in Perspective|publisher=RFID Asia|date=2006-12-11|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nMicrochip\u2013induced tumors have been noted during animal trials.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microchip-induced tumors in laboratory rodents and dogs: A review of the literature 1990\u20132006 |pages=337\u2013349 |last=Albrecht |first=Katherine |year=2010 |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514622|isbn=978-1-4244-7777-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html |title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors |last=Lewan |first=Todd |newspaper=Washington Post |date=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Shielding===\n{{Further information|Aluminium foil#Electromagnetic shielding}}\nIn an effort to prevent the passive \u201c[[RFID skimming|skimming]]\u201d of RFID-enabled cards or passports, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) issued a set of test procedures for evaluating electromagnetically opaque sleeves.<ref>{{cite web|title = Electromagnetically Opaque Sleeve Test Procedure version 3.0.0|publisher = GSA|url = http://fips201ep.cio.gov/documents/Electromagnetically%20Opaque%20Sleeve_Test%20Procedure_v3.0.0.pdf}}</ref> For shielding products to be in compliance with FIPS-201 guidelines, they must meet or exceed this published standard;

[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2\u20134&nbsp;cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the incident wave at the tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falkensecurenetworks.com/PDFs/A_Primer_on_RFID.pdf|title=A Primer on RFID}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{criticism section|date=June 2012}}\n[[Image:Stoprfid-logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the anti-RFID campaign by German privacy group [[digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD)]]\n\n===Privacy===\n\nThe use of RFID has engendered considerable controversy and even product [[boycott]]s by [[consumer privacy]] advocates. Consumer privacy experts [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]] are two prominent critics of the \"spychip\" technology. The two main privacy concerns regarding RFID are:\n* Since the owner of an item will not necessarily be aware of the presence of an RFID tag and the tag can be read at a distance without the knowledge of the individual, it becomes possible to gather sensitive data about an individual without consent.\n* If a tagged item is paid for by credit card or in conjunction with use of a [[loyalty card]], then it would be possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item (contained in the RFID tag). This is only true if the person doing the watching also had access to the loyalty card data and the credit card data, and the person with the equipment knows where the purchaser is going to be.\n\nMost concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags affixed to products remain functional even after the products have been purchased and taken home and thus can be used for [[surveillance]] and other purposes unrelated to their supply chain inventory functions.<ref>Markus Hansen, Sebastian Meissner: [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/2007-hansen-meissner-tracking-epc-rfid-ifip.pdf Identification and Tracking of Individuals and Social Networks using the Electronic Product Code on RFID Tags], IFIP Summer School, Karlstad, 2007, [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/20070807-ifip-hansen-meissner-tracking-rfid-epc.pdf Slides].</ref>\n\nThe RFID Network argued that these fears are unfounded in the first episode of their syndicated cable TV series by letting RF engineers demonstrate how RFID works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0y3v.errandrunner.org/onbqfGf|title=How to read data from rfid reader|website=0y3v.errandrunner.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> They provided images of RF engineers driving an RFID-enabled van around a building and trying to take an inventory of items inside. They discussed satellite tracking of a passive RFID tag, which is surprising since the maximum range is under 200m.\n\nThe concerns raised by the above may be addressed in part by use of the [[Clipped Tag]]. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by [[IBM]] researchers [[Paul Moskowitz]] and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range&nbsp;\u2013 less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.\n\nHowever, read range is a function of both the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.<ref>[http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040106/http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081350/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 privacy advocates from CASPIAN and the German privacy group [[digitalcourage|FoeBuD]] were invited to the METRO Future Store in [[Germany]], where an RFID pilot project was implemented.

An RFID tag consists of a tiny radio transponder; a radio receiver and transmitter.  When triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data, usually an identifying inventory number, back to the reader.  This number can be used to inventory goods.  There are two types.  ''Passive tags'' are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating [[radio wave]]s.  ''Active tags'' are powered by a battery and thus can be read at a greater range from the RFID reader; up to hundreds of meters.  Unlike a [[barcode]], the tag doesn't need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of [[automatic identification and data capture]] (AIDC).<ref>[http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification Automatic Identification and Data Collection (AIDC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505190510/http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/automatic-identification |date=May 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRFID tags are used in many industries. For example, an RFID tag attached to an automobile during production can be used to track its progress through the assembly line; RFID-tagged pharmaceuticals can be tracked through warehouses; and [[Microchip implant (animal)|implanting RFID microchips]] in livestock and pets enables positive identification of animals.\n\nSince RFID tags can be attached to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns.<ref name=\"Angell\">{{cite journal |journal=Communications of the ACM |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=12 |pages=90\u201396 |title=RFID and the end of cash? |author=Angell, I., Kietzmann, J. |doi=10.1145/1183236.1183237 |url=http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |accessdate=9 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224155226/http://beedie.sfu.ca/files/Research/Journal_Articles/Journal_Articles_misc/RFID_and_the_end_of_Cash.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These concerns resulted in standard specifications development addressing privacy and security issues.

The RFID tag includes either fixed or programmable logic for processing the transmission and sensor data, respectively.\n\nRFID tags can be either passive, active or battery-assisted passive. An active tag has an on-board battery and periodically transmits its ID signal. A battery-assisted passive has a small battery on board and is activated when in the presence of an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission. That makes a difference in interference and in exposure to radiation.\n\nTags may either be read-only, having a factory-assigned serial number that is used as a key into a database, or may be read/write, where object-specific data can be written into the tag by the system user. Field programmable tags may be write-once, read-multiple; \"blank\" tags may be written with an electronic product code by the user.\n\nThe RFID tag receives the message and then responds with its identification and other information. This may be only a unique tag serial number, or may be product-related information such as a stock number, lot or batch number, production date, or other specific information. Since tags have individual serial numbers, the RFID system design can discriminate among several tags that might be within the range of the RFID reader and read them simultaneously.\n\n===Readers===\n\nRFID systems can be classified by the type of tag and reader. A '''Passive Reader Active Tag''' ('''PRAT''') system has a passive reader which only receives radio signals from active tags (battery operated, transmit only). The reception range of a PRAT system reader can be adjusted from {{convert|1|-|2000|ft|-2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-do-rfid-tags-work/|title=How Does RFID Technology Work?|website=MakeUseOf|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>, allowing flexibility in applications such as asset protection and supervision.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Passive Tag''' ('''ARPT''') system has an active reader, which transmits interrogator signals and also receives authentication replies from passive tags.\n\nAn '''Active Reader Active Tag''' ('''ARAT''') system uses active tags awoken with an interrogator signal from the active reader. A variation of this system could also use a Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tag which acts like a passive tag but has a small battery to power the tag's return reporting signal.\n\nFixed readers are set up to create a specific interrogation zone which can be tightly controlled. This allows a highly defined reading area for when tags go in and out of the interrogation zone.

Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to the reader antenna because they are only a small percentage of a wavelength away. In this [[Near and far field|near field]] region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in the reader. The tag can modulate the field produced by the reader by changing the electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that the reader can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can [[backscatter]] a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.<ref name=Dobkin08>Daniel M. Dobkin, ''The RF in RFID: Passive UHF RFID In Practice'', Newnes 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-7506-8209-1}}, chapter 8</ref>\n\nAn [[Electronic Product Code]] (EPC) is one common type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag contains a 96-bit string of data.  The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages the data for this tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]], the total electronic product code number can be used as a key into a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.<ref>John R. Vacca ''Computer and information security handbook'', Morgan Kaufmann, 2009 {{ISBN|0-12-374354-0}}, page 208</ref>\n\nOften more than one tag will respond to a tag reader, for example, many individual products with tags may be shipped in a common box or on a common pallet. Collision detection is important to allow reading of data.  Two different types of protocols are used to [[Singulation|\"singulate\"]] a particular tag, allowing its data to be read in the midst of many similar tags.  In a [[ALOHAnet|slotted Aloha]] system, the reader broadcasts an initialization command and a parameter that the tags individually use to pseudo-randomly delay their responses. When using an \"adaptive binary tree\" protocol, the reader sends an initialization symbol and then transmits one bit of ID data at a time; only tags with matching bits respond, and eventually only one tag matches the complete ID string.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt ,''RFID essentials'',  O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}}, pages 88\u201389</ref>\n[[File:RFID search environment.png|thumb|right|An example of a binary tree method of identifying an RFID tag]]\nBoth methods have drawbacks when used with many tags or with multiple overlapping readers.\n\n===Bulk reading===\n\"Bulk reading\" is a strategy for interrogating multiple tags at the same time, but lacks sufficient precision for inventory control.  A group of objects, all of them RFID tagged, are read completely from one single reader position at one time. Bulk reading is a possible use of [[High frequency|HF]] (ISO 18000-3), [[UHF]] (ISO 18000-6) and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] (ISO 18000-4) RFID tags. However, as tags respond strictly sequentially, the time needed for bulk reading grows linearly with the number of labels to be read. This means it takes at least twice as long to read twice as many labels. Due to collision effects, the time required is greater. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rfidjournal.com/site/faqs|title=Frequently Asked Questions - RFID Journal|website=www.rfidjournal.com|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nA group of tags has to be illuminated by the interrogating signal just like a single tag. This is not a challenge concerning energy, but with respect to visibility; if any of the tags are shielded by other tags, they might not be sufficiently illuminated to return a sufficient response. The response conditions for inductively coupled [[High frequency|HF]] RFID tags and coil antennas in magnetic fields appear better than for UHF or SHF dipole fields, but then distance limits apply and may prevent success.\n\nUnder operational conditions, bulk reading is not reliable. Bulk reading can be a rough guide for logistics decisions, but due to a high proportion of reading failures, it is not (yet) suitable for inventory management. However, when a single RFID tag might be seen as not guaranteeing a proper read, a bunch of RFID tags, where at least one will respond, may be a safer approach for detecting a known grouping of objects. In this respect, bulk reading is a [[Fuzzy mathematics|fuzzy]] method for process support. From the perspective of cost and effect, bulk reading is not reported as an economical approach to secure process control in logistics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerc.com/files/SGTF_Report_Final_posted_v1.1.pdf|title=STGF Report}}</ref>\n\n===Miniaturization===\nRFID tags are easy to conceal or incorporate in other items.

The tag can be read if passed near a reader, even if it is covered by the object or not visible. The tag can be read inside a case, carton, box or other container, and unlike barcodes, RFID tags can be read hundreds at a time. Bar codes can only be read one at a time using current devices.\n\nIn 2011, the cost of passive tags started at US$0.09 each; special tags, meant to be mounted on metal or withstand gamma sterilization, can go up to US$5. Active tags for tracking containers, medical assets, or monitoring environmental conditions in data centers start at US$50 and can go up over US$100 each. Battery-Assisted Passive (BAP) tags are in the US$3\u201310 range and also have sensor capability like temperature and humidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eptls.org/rfid.html|title=EPTLS {{!}} The Electronic Product Tag & Labelling Scheme|website=eptls.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nRFID can be used in a variety of applications,<ref>{{cite web|author=Martein Meints|date=June 2007|title= D3.7 A Structured Collection on Information and Literature on Technological and Usability Aspects of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), FIDIS deliverable 3(7)|url=http://www.fidis.net/resources/deliverables/hightechid/#c1782|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Paolo Magrassi|author-link=Paolo Magrassi|year=2001|url=http://www.gartner.com|title=A World Of Smart Objects: The Role Of Auto Identification Technologies|accessdate=2007-06-24}}</ref> such as:\n\n[[File:RFkey.jpg|thumb|Electronic key for RFID based lock system]]\n* Access management\n* Tracking of goods\n* Tracking of persons and animals<ref>Silva, S., Lowry, M., Macaya-Solis, C., Byatt, B., & Lucas, M.

This combination of RFID [[real-time locating system]] hardware and software provides a powerful data collection tool for facilities seeking to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nThe trend is toward using ISO 18000-6c as the tag of choice and combining an active tagging system that relies on existing 802.11X wireless infrastructure for active tags.<ref>{{Citation|title=Systems, computer media, and methods for using electromagnetic frequency (EMF) identification (ID) devices for monitoring, collection, analysis, use and tracking of personal, medical, transaction, and location data for one or more individuals|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160189174A1/en|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref>\n\nSince 2004 a number of U.S. hospitals have begun implanting patients with RFID tags and using RFID systems, usually for workflow and inventory management.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Fisher, Jill A., Monahan, Torin|year= 2012|title= Evaluation of Real-time Location Systems in their Hospital Contexts|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.07.001|pmid= 22857790|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=81 |issue=10|pages= 705\u2013712|url=http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/Fisher_Monahan_IJMI-2012.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Fisher, Jill A., Monahan, Torin|year= 2008|title= Tracking the Social Dimensions of RFID Systems in Hospitals|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2007.04.010|pmid= 17544841|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=77 |issue=3|pages= 176\u2013183|url=http://publicsurveillance.com/papers/Fisher_Monahan_RFID_IJMI.pdf}}</ref><ref>Fisher, Jill A. 2006.

The 134&nbsp;kHz RFID chips, from VeriChip Corp. can incorporate personal medical information and could save lives and limit injuries from errors in medical treatments, according to the company. Anti-RFID activists [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]] discovered an [[FDA Warning Letter]] that spelled out health risks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spychips.com/devices/verichip-fda-report.html |title=Verichip Special Report |publisher=spychips.com |accessdate=2013-09-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323031257/http://www.spychips.com/devices/verichip-fda-report.html |archivedate=2012-03-23 }}</ref> According to the FDA, these include \"adverse tissue reaction\", \"migration of the implanted transponder\", \"failure of implanted transponder\", \"electrical hazards\" and \"magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] incompatibility.\"\n\n====Libraries====\n[[Image:RFID Tags.jpg|thumb|RFID tags used in libraries: square book tag, round CD/DVD tag and rectangular VHS tag]]\nLibraries have used RFID to replace the barcodes on library items. The tag can contain identifying information or may just be a key into a database. An RFID system may replace or supplement bar codes and may offer another method of inventory management and self-service checkout by patrons. It can also act as a [[security]] device, taking the place of the more traditional [[electronic article surveillance|electromagnetic security strip]].<ref name=\"butters\">{{cite journal |last1=Butters |first1=Alan |title=Radio Frequency Identification: An Introduction for Library Professionals |journal=Australasian Public Libraries and Information Services |volume=19 |issue=4 | date=December 2006 |pages=164\u201374 |url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=312996058408409;res=IELHSS |issn=1030-5033}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that over 30 million library items worldwide now contain RFID tags, including some in the [[Vatican Library]] in [[Rome]].<ref name=\"singh\">{{cite journal |doi=10.6017/ital.v25i1.3326 |title=The State of RFID Applications in Libraries |year=2013 |last1=Sing |first1=Jay |last2=Brar |first2=Navjit |last3=Fong |first3=Carmen |journal=Information Technology and Libraries |volume=25\u201332|page=24 }}</ref>\n\nSince RFID tags can be read through an item, there is no need to open a book cover or DVD case to scan an item, and a stack of books can be read simultaneously.  Book tags can be read while books are in motion on a [[conveyor belt]], which reduces staff time. This can all be done by the borrowers themselves, reducing the need for library staff assistance. With portable readers, inventories could be done on a whole shelf of materials within seconds.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Radio Frequency Identification |first1=Rachel |last1=Wadham |journal=Library Mosaics |volume=14 |issue=5 |year=2003 |page=22}}</ref>\nHowever, as of 2008 this technology remained too costly for many smaller libraries, and the conversion period has been estimated at 11 months for an average-size library. A 2004 Dutch estimate was that a library which lends 100,000 books per year should plan on a cost of \u20ac50,000 (borrow- and return-stations: 12,500 each, detection porches 10,000 each; tags 0.36 each). RFID taking a large burden off staff could also mean that fewer staff will be needed, resulting in some of them getting laid off,<ref name=\"singh\"/> but that has so far not happened in North America where recent surveys have not returned a single library that cut staff because of adding RFID. In fact, library budgets are being reduced for personnel and increased for infrastructure, making it necessary for libraries to add automation to compensate for the reduced staff size. Also, the tasks that RFID takes over are largely not the primary tasks of librarians. A finding in the Netherlands is that borrowers are pleased with the fact that staff are now more available for answering questions.\n\nPrivacy concerns have been raised surrounding library use of RFID. Because some RFID tags can be read from up to {{convert|100|m}}, there is some concern over whether sensitive information could be collected from an unwilling source. However, library RFID tags do not contain any patron information,<ref>{{cite journal |first=David |last=Dorman |title=RFID Poses No Problem for Patron Privacy |journal=American Libraries |volume=34 |issue=11 | date=December 2003 |page=86 |url=http://www.ala.org/PrinterTemplate.cfm?section=archive&template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=50931}}</ref> and the tags used in the majority of libraries use a frequency only readable from approximately {{convert|10|ft}}.<ref name=\"butters\"/> Further, another non-library agency could potentially record the RFID tags of every person leaving the library without the library administrator's knowledge or consent. One simple option is to let the book transmit a code that has meaning only in conjunction with the library's database. Another possible enhancement would be to give each book a new code every time it is returned. In future, should readers become ubiquitous (and possibly networked), then stolen books could be traced even outside the library. Tag removal could be made difficult if the tags are so small that they fit invisibly inside a (random) page, possibly put there by the publisher.\n\n====Museums====\nRFID technologies are now also implemented in end-user applications in museums. An example was the custom-designed temporary research application, \"eXspot,\" at the [[Exploratorium]], a science museum in [[San Francisco, California]]. A visitor entering the museum received an RF Tag that could be carried as a card. The eXspot system enabled the visitor to receive information about specific exhibits. Aside from the exhibit information, the visitor could take photographs of themselves at the exhibit. It was also intended to allow the visitor to take data for later analysis. The collected information could be retrieved at home from a \"personalized\" website keyed to the RFID tag.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1081992.1082021 |title=RFID enhances visitors' museum experience at the Exploratorium |year=2005 |last1=Hsi |first1=Sherry |last2=Fait |first2=Holly |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=60\u20135}}</ref>\n\n====Schools and universities====\nSchool authorities in the Japanese city of [[Osaka]] are now chipping children's clothing, backpacks, and student IDs in a primary school.<ref name=LAN>{{cite web|url=http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |title=Schoolchildren to be RFID-chipped |publisher=Networks.silicon.com |accessdate=2013-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427003216/http://networks.silicon.com/lans/0,39024663,39122042,00.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2012 }}</ref> A school in [[Doncaster]], [[England]] is piloting a monitoring system designed to keep tabs on pupils by tracking radio chips in their uniforms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/22/kid_chipping_doncaster_go/ |title=Schoolkid chipping trial 'a success' |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=2007-10-22 |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref> [[List of further education colleges in England#S|St Charles Sixth Form College]] in west [[London]], England, started in 2008, uses an RFID card system to check in and out of the main gate, to both track attendance and prevent unauthorized entrance. Similarly, [[Whitcliffe Mount School]] in [[Cleckheaton]], England uses RFID to track pupils and staff in and out of the building via a specially designed card. In the Philippines, some schools already use RFID in IDs for borrowing books. Gates in those particular schools have RFID ID scanners for buying items at a school shop and canteen. RFID is also used in the library, and to sign in and out for student and teacher attendance.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:2008 Nike+ Human Race in Taipei the ChampionChip.jpg|thumb|ChampionChip]]\n[[Transponder timing|RFID for timing races]] began in the early 1990s with pigeon racing, introduced by the company [[Deister Electronics]] in Germany. RFID can provide race start and end timings for individuals in large races where it is impossible to get accurate stopwatch readings for every entrant.\n\nIn the race, the racers wear tags that are read by antennas placed alongside the track or on mats across the track. UHF tags provide accurate readings with specially designed antennas. Rush error, lap count errors and accidents at start time are avoided since anyone can start and finish any time without being in a batch mode.\n[[File:Marathon Zeitnahme.JPG|thumb|left|[[jchip|J-Chip]] 8-channel receiver next to timing mat. The athlete wears a chip on a strap around his ankle. [https://web.archive.org/web/19961218232821/http://www.ironman.de/ Ironman Germany] 2007 in Frankfurt.]]\n\nThe design of chip+antenna controls the range from which it can be read. Short range compact chips are twist tied to the shoe or velcro strapped to the ankle. These need to be about 400mm from the mat and so give very good temporal resolution. Alternatively, a chip plus a very large (125mm square) antenna can be incorporated into the bib number worn on the athlete's chest at about 1.25m height.\n\nPassive and active RFID systems are used in off-road events such as [[Orienteering]], [[Enduro]] and [[Hare and Hound (Motorcycle Race)|Hare and Hounds]] racing. Riders have a transponder on their person, normally on their arm. When they complete a lap they swipe or touch the receiver which is connected to a computer and log their lap time.\n\nRFID is being adapted by many recruitment agencies which have a PET (physical endurance test) as their qualifying procedure, especially in cases where the candidate volumes may run into millions (Indian Railway recruitment cells, police and power sector).\n\nA number of [[ski resort]]s have adopted RFID tags to provide skiers hands-free access to [[ski lift]]s. Skiers do not have to take their passes out of their pockets. Ski jackets have a left pocket into which the chip+card fits. This nearly contacts the sensor unit on the left of the turnstile as the skier pushes through to the lift. These systems were based on high frequency (HF) at 13.56 megahertz. The bulk of ski areas in Europe, from Verbier to Chamonix, use these systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cliqology.com/2010/09/epic-mix-skiiers-and-snowboards-social-media-dream/ |title=Epic Mix \u2013 Skiiers [sic] and Snowboarders Social Media Dream |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |title=Vail Resorts Launches Epic Mix &#124; SNOWBOARD MAGAZINE |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100904085254/http://snowboard-mag.com/content/vail-resorts-launches-epic-mix-39814 |accessdate=2020-03-01|archive-date=2010-09-04 }}</ref><ref>Kinsella, Bret.

They may never completely replace barcodes, due in part to their higher cost and the advantage of multiple data sources on the same object. Also, unlike RFID labels, barcodes can be generated and distributed electronically, ''e.g.'' via e-mail or mobile phone, for printing or display by the recipient. An example is airline [[boarding passes]]. The new [[Electronic Product Code|EPC]], along with several other schemes, is widely available at reasonable cost.\n\nThe storage of data associated with tracking items will require many [[terabyte]]s. Filtering and categorizing RFID data is needed to create useful information. It is likely that goods will be tracked by the pallet using RFID tags, and at package level with Universal Product Code ([[Universal Product Code|UPC]]) or [[European Article Number|EAN]] from unique barcodes.\n\nThe unique identity is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special choice of the numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft and other forms of product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that is well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope with quality deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.\n\n===Waste management===\nRFID use has recently developed in the [[waste management]] industry. RFID tags are installed on waste collection carts, linking carts to the owner's account for easy billing and service verification. The tag is embedded into a garbage and recycle container, and the RFID reader is affixed to the garbage and recycle trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waste360.com/route-optimization/rfid-still-early-stages-adoption-waste-industry|title=RFID Still In Early Stages of Adoption by Waste Industry|last=|first=|date=2016-08-10|website=|access-date=}}</ref> RFID also measures a customer's set-out rate and provides insight as to the number of carts serviced by each waste collection vehicle. This RFID process replaces traditional \"[[pay as you throw]]\" (PAYT) [[municipal solid waste]] usage-pricing models.\n\n===Telemetry===\nActive RFID tags have the potential to function as low-cost remote sensors that broadcast [[telemetry]] back to a base station. Applications of tagometry data could include sensing of road conditions by implanted [[Bluetooth low energy beacon|beacons]], weather reports, and noise level monitoring.<ref>{{ISSN search link|0001-0782}}</ref>\n\nPassive RFID tags can also report sensor data. For example, the [[Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform]] is a passive tag that reports temperature, acceleration and capacitance to commercial Gen2 RFID readers.\n\nIt is possible that active or battery-assisted passive (BAP) RFID tags could broadcast a signal to an in-store receiver to determine whether the RFID tag (product) is in the store.\n\n==Regulation and standardization==\nTo avoid injuries to humans and animals RF transmission needs to be controlled.<ref name=\"regs\">{{Cite web |url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/basics-rfid-regulations/ |title=RFID Regulations |date=n.d |website=RFID4U |language=en-US |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\nA number of organizations have set standards for RFID, including the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), [[ASTM International]], the [[DASH7]] Alliance and [[EPCglobal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nSeveral specific industries also have set guidelines, including the Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) for tracking IT Assets with RFID, the Computer Technology Industry Association [[CompTIA]] for certifying RFID engineers, and the International Airlines Transport Association [[IATA]] for luggage in airports.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nEvery country can set its own rules for [[frequency allocation]] for RFID tags, and not all radio bands are available in all countries.

Two tag air interfaces (the protocol for exchanging information between a tag and a reader) were defined (but not ratified) by EPCglobal prior to 2003. These protocols, commonly known as Class 0 and Class 1, saw significant commercial implementation in 2002\u20132005.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://rfid4u.com/rfid-basics-resources/how-to-select-a-correct-rfid-tag-standards-mandates/ |title = RFID Standards and Mandates}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Hardware Action Group created a new protocol, the Class 1 Generation 2 interface, which addressed a number of problems that had been experienced with Class 0 and Class 1 tags. The EPC Gen2 standard was approved in December 2004. This was approved after a contention from [[Intermec]] that the standard may infringe a number of their RFID-related patents.

A large amount of data may be generated that is not useful for managing inventory or other applications. For example, a customer moving a product from one shelf to another, or a pallet load of articles that passes several readers while being moved in a warehouse, are events that do not produce data that are meaningful to an inventory control system.<ref>Bill Glover, Himanshu Bhatt, ''RFID Essentials'', O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2006 {{ISBN|0-596-00944-5}} page 43</ref>\n\nEvent filtering is required to reduce this data inflow to a meaningful depiction of moving goods passing a threshold. Various concepts{{Examples|date=June 2010}} have been designed, mainly offered as ''[[middleware]]'' performing the filtering from noisy and redundant raw data to significant processed data.\n\n===Global standardization===\nThe frequencies used for UHF RFID in the USA are as of 2007 incompatible with those of Europe or Japan.

Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised with respect to the [[United States Department of Defense]]'s recent adoption of RFID tags for [[supply chain management]].<ref>{{cite web|work = Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)|title = What's New|date = 4 April 2007|url = http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060228101133/http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/rfid/index.htm|archivedate = 28 February 2006}}</ref> More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with readers can be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to [[RFID skimming|skimming]] and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.<ref name=Hancke>{{cite journal|last=Hancke|first=Gerhard P|title=Practical eavesdropping and skimming attacks on high-frequency RFID tokens|journal=Journal of Computer Security|year=2011|volume=19|issue=2|pages=259\u2013288|doi=10.3233/JCS-2010-0407|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|accessdate=10 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527141257/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/xx855446h2kh84r2/|archivedate=27 May 2016|citeseerx=10.1.1.169.9341}}</ref>\n\nA second method of prevention is by using cryptography. [[Rolling code]]s and [[challenge-response authentication]] (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. Rolling codes rely upon the tag's id being changed after each interrogation, while CRA uses software to ask for a [[cryptographic]]ally coded response from the tag. The protocols used during CRA can be [[symmetric key cryptography|symmetric]], or may use [[public key cryptography]].<ref name=RFIDHbook1>{{cite book|last=Ilyas|first=edited by Syed Ahson, Mohammad|title=RFID handbook : applications, technology, security, and privacy|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781420054996|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q4aCyZnq0cwC&pg=PA478&lpg=PA478&dq=Rather,+the+reader+issues+a+challenge+to+the+tag,+which+responds+with+a+result+computed+using+a+cryptographic+circuit+keyed+with+some+secret+value&source=bl&ots=nL2ORy_M-7&sig=mo9QSZyOeEEwnO9xqgAAg5cnx08&hl=en&sa=X&ei=82YhUIjwGeWg0QXp6oDwBQ&ved=0CGMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Rather%2C%20the%20reader%20issues%20a%20challenge%20to%20the%20tag%2C%20which%20responds%20with%20a%20result%20computed%20using%20a%20cryptographic%20circuit%20keyed%20with%20some%20secret%20value&f=false|edition=[Online-Ausg.]|accessdate=7 August 2012|page=478|chapter=26.5}}</ref>\n\nUnauthorized reading of RFID tags presents a risk to privacy and to business secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vde-verlag.de/proceedings-en/453168007.html|title=Business risks from naive use of RFID in tracking, tracing and logistics - Conference papers - VDE Publishing House|website=www.vde-verlag.de|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Unauthorized readers can potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or the contents of a package.<ref name=RFIDHbook1/> Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|title = RFID Privacy and Security|publisher = RSA Laboratories|accessdate = 2013-09-22|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061218210709/http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2115|archivedate = 2006-12-18}}</ref> as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://avoine.net/rfid/|title = RFID Security and Privacy Lounge|publisher=Avoine.net|accessdate=2013-09-22}}</ref> There are also concerns that the database structure of [[Object Naming Service]] may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to [[denial-of-service attack]]s, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.<ref>{{cite web|first=Adi|last=Tedjasaputra|url=http://www.rfid-asia.info/2007/02/putting-rfid-network-security-in.htm|title=Putting RFID Network Security in Perspective|publisher=RFID Asia|date=2006-12-11|accessdate=2007-08-03}}</ref>\n\n===Health===\nMicrochip\u2013induced tumors have been noted during animal trials.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microchip-induced tumors in laboratory rodents and dogs: A review of the literature 1990\u20132006 |pages=337\u2013349 |last=Albrecht |first=Katherine |year=2010 |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/ISTAS.2010.5514622|isbn=978-1-4244-7777-7 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090800997_pf.html |title=Chip Implants Linked to Animal Tumors |last=Lewan |first=Todd |newspaper=Washington Post |date=8 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Shielding===\n{{Further information|Aluminium foil#Electromagnetic shielding}}\nIn an effort to prevent the passive \u201c[[RFID skimming|skimming]]\u201d of RFID-enabled cards or passports, the U.S. [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) issued a set of test procedures for evaluating electromagnetically opaque sleeves.<ref>{{cite web|title = Electromagnetically Opaque Sleeve Test Procedure version 3.0.0|publisher = GSA|url = http://fips201ep.cio.gov/documents/Electromagnetically%20Opaque%20Sleeve_Test%20Procedure_v3.0.0.pdf}}</ref> For shielding products to be in compliance with FIPS-201 guidelines, they must meet or exceed this published standard;

[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] Ultra-HighFID tags (pallets and cartons) are difficult to read when placed within a few millimetres of a metal surface, although their read range is actually increased when they are spaced 2\u20134&nbsp;cm from a metal surface due to positive reinforcement of the reflected wave and the incident wave at the tag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falkensecurenetworks.com/PDFs/A_Primer_on_RFID.pdf|title=A Primer on RFID}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n{{criticism section|date=June 2012}}\n[[Image:Stoprfid-logo.svg|thumb|Logo of the anti-RFID campaign by German privacy group [[digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD)]]\n\n===Privacy===\n\nThe use of RFID has engendered considerable controversy and even product [[boycott]]s by [[consumer privacy]] advocates. Consumer privacy experts [[Katherine Albrecht]] and [[Liz McIntyre (writer)|Liz McIntyre]] are two prominent critics of the \"spychip\" technology. The two main privacy concerns regarding RFID are:\n* Since the owner of an item will not necessarily be aware of the presence of an RFID tag and the tag can be read at a distance without the knowledge of the individual, it becomes possible to gather sensitive data about an individual without consent.\n* If a tagged item is paid for by credit card or in conjunction with use of a [[loyalty card]], then it would be possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item (contained in the RFID tag). This is only true if the person doing the watching also had access to the loyalty card data and the credit card data, and the person with the equipment knows where the purchaser is going to be.\n\nMost concerns revolve around the fact that RFID tags affixed to products remain functional even after the products have been purchased and taken home and thus can be used for [[surveillance]] and other purposes unrelated to their supply chain inventory functions.<ref>Markus Hansen, Sebastian Meissner: [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/2007-hansen-meissner-tracking-epc-rfid-ifip.pdf Identification and Tracking of Individuals and Social Networks using the Electronic Product Code on RFID Tags], IFIP Summer School, Karlstad, 2007, [https://tepin.aiki.de/blog/uploads/20070807-ifip-hansen-meissner-tracking-rfid-epc.pdf Slides].</ref>\n\nThe RFID Network argued that these fears are unfounded in the first episode of their syndicated cable TV series by letting RF engineers demonstrate how RFID works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://0y3v.errandrunner.org/onbqfGf|title=How to read data from rfid reader|website=0y3v.errandrunner.org|access-date=2019-04-22}}</ref> They provided images of RF engineers driving an RFID-enabled van around a building and trying to take an inventory of items inside. They discussed satellite tracking of a passive RFID tag, which is surprising since the maximum range is under 200m.\n\nThe concerns raised by the above may be addressed in part by use of the [[Clipped Tag]]. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by [[IBM]] researchers [[Paul Moskowitz]] and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off a portion of the tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range&nbsp;\u2013 less than a few inches or centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.\n\nHowever, read range is a function of both the reader and the tag itself. Improvements in technology may increase read ranges for tags. Tags may be read at longer ranges than they are designed for by increasing reader power. The limit on read distance then becomes the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal reflected from the tag back to the reader. Researchers at two security conferences have demonstrated that passive Ultra-HighFID tags normally read at ranges of up to 30 feet, can be read at ranges of 50 to 69 feet using suitable equipment.<ref>[http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040106/http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/000798.html|date=September 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207081350/http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2005/07/_defcon_rfid_wo.html|date=February 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004 privacy advocates from CASPIAN and the German privacy group [[digitalcourage|FoeBuD]] were invited to the METRO Future Store in [[Germany]], where an RFID pilot project was implemented.

The chip is flip-chip assembled on the Al/PET flexible substrate through ACA hot-press process. After bonding process, the shear strength of the tag inlay can be measured using the bond tester.

Of the last song, Jett later commented that \"People worried that I didn't change the words in 'Crimson and Clover' to 'him' from 'her'. It was only because that wouldn't have rhymed.\"<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\nOther covers appeared in limited editions: \"[[Louie Louie]]\" ([[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]], later performed by [[The Kingsmen]]) and \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" ([[Eddie Cochran]]) were included as bonus tracks on the CD release, and the traditional Christmas carol \"[[Little Drummer Boy]]\" was a seasonal addition to the LP.\n\n''I Love Rock 'n Roll'' was made at a vigorous pace. \"During the weekdays we'd be in the studio and during the weekends we'd travel around the New York area, the Northeast, doing gigs,\" Jett recalled. \"So we were doing both without really stopping. Which was good I thought, it really kept us together, it kept us sharp.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Lababedi |first=Iman |date=June 1982 |title=Joan Jett is a Very Nice Girl |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/joan-jett-is-a-very-nice-girl |magazine=[[Creem]] |access-date=June 14, 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nEarly copies of the album released during December 1981 ended with the track \"[[Little Drummer Boy]]\". However, after the holiday season passed, the track was replaced by the newly recorded \"Oh Woe Is Me\" on most pressings.<ref name=\"solazzi\" /> The LP saw a vinyl reissue in 2009 containing both \"Little Drummer Boy\", \"Oh Woe Is Me\", and the rehearsal version of \"You Don't Know What You've Got\" that was the original B-side to [[Boardwalk Records]] issues of the \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Joan Jett version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" single. It was possible to acquire \"Oh Woe Is Me\" without purchasing a replacement album, as it was also released as the B-side of the \"Crimson and Clover\" single.\n\n\"Summertime Blues\" was originally left off the vinyl LP, and Boardwalk passed on releasing it as an official commercial single. Instead, Boardwalk placed the song as the B-side of \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\", in a promo-only 12-inch release (Boardwalk NB-019-S-5) sent to US rock radio stations. Many DJs and programmers preferred the B-side however, and \"Summertime Blues\" became a Most Added listing. (The A-side nonetheless peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.) The song was eventually released as a one-sided single in Canada and as a 12-inch single in Australia, accompanied by \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\".\n\nThe initial CD release was in 1992 on [[Blackheart Records]] and included three bonus tracks.\n\nThe album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD in 1998 and included two additional bonus tracks.\n\nIn conjunction with Joan Jett & the Blackhearts being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 18, 2015, exactly 33 \u2153 years after ''I Love Rock 'n' Roll'' was originally released on November 18, 1981, a 2CD/2LP titled ''I Love Rock 'n' Roll 33 \u2153 Anniversary Edition'' was released. This commemorative edition paired the original album with a second disc of previously unreleased live recordings made in New York from 1981.\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe portrait image used for the cover was taken by British photographer [[Mick Rock]].

Of the last song, Jett later commented that \"People worried that I didn't change the words in 'Crimson and Clover' to 'him' from 'her'. It was only because that wouldn't have rhymed.\"<ref name=\"Record8\"/>\n\nOther covers appeared in limited editions: \"[[Louie Louie]]\" ([[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]], later performed by [[The Kingsmen]]) and \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" ([[Eddie Cochran]]) were included as bonus tracks on the CD release, and the traditional Christmas carol \"[[Little Drummer Boy]]\" was a seasonal addition to the LP.\n\n''I Love Rock 'n Roll'' was made at a vigorous pace. \"During the weekdays we'd be in the studio and during the weekends we'd travel around the New York area, the Northeast, doing gigs,\" Jett recalled. \"So we were doing both without really stopping. Which was good I thought, it really kept us together, it kept us sharp.\"<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Lababedi |first=Iman |date=June 1982 |title=Joan Jett is a Very Nice Girl |url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/joan-jett-is-a-very-nice-girl |magazine=[[Creem]] |access-date=June 14, 2019 |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nEarly copies of the album released during December 1981 ended with the track \"[[Little Drummer Boy]]\". However, after the holiday season passed, the track was replaced by the newly recorded \"Oh Woe Is Me\" on most pressings.<ref name=\"solazzi\" /> The LP saw a vinyl reissue in 2009 containing both \"Little Drummer Boy\", \"Oh Woe Is Me\", and the rehearsal version of \"You Don't Know What You've Got\" that was the original B-side to [[Boardwalk Records]] issues of the \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Joan Jett version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\" single. It was possible to acquire \"Oh Woe Is Me\" without purchasing a replacement album, as it was also released as the B-side of the \"Crimson and Clover\" single.\n\n\"Summertime Blues\" was originally left off the vinyl LP, and Boardwalk passed on releasing it as an official commercial single. Instead, Boardwalk placed the song as the B-side of \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\", in a promo-only 12-inch release (Boardwalk NB-019-S-5) sent to US rock radio stations. Many DJs and programmers preferred the B-side however, and \"Summertime Blues\" became a Most Added listing. (The A-side nonetheless peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.) The song was eventually released as a one-sided single in Canada and as a 12-inch single in Australia, accompanied by \"Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\".\n\nThe initial CD release was in 1992 on [[Blackheart Records]] and included three bonus tracks.\n\nThe album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD in 1998 and included two additional bonus tracks.\n\nIn conjunction with Joan Jett & the Blackhearts being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 18, 2015, exactly 33 \u2153 years after ''I Love Rock 'n' Roll'' was originally released on November 18, 1981, a 2CD/2LP titled ''I Love Rock 'n' Roll 33 \u2153 Anniversary Edition'' was released. This commemorative edition paired the original album with a second disc of previously unreleased live recordings made in New York from 1981.\n\n== Cover art ==\nThe portrait image used for the cover was taken by British photographer [[Mick Rock]].

Jonah begins a search for Wilhelm \"The Wolf\" Zuchs, the Nazi doctor who tortured Meyer and Ruth thirty years before. From clues, Jonah discovers Ruth's files which lead him to capture a surgeon he believes to be the Wolf who Meyer executes. However, Meyer doesn't recite a prayer he'd sworn to Ruth he would if he ever caught up to the Wolf, leading a horrified Jonah to put the pieces together and realize that Meyer is actually the Wolf. Zuchs confesses, explaining that he had killed the real Meyer to take his identity and escape the Soviets while later undergoing [[plastic surgery]] (from the SS surgeon he just now killed) to complete the transformation. Having lived a Jewish life for thirty years, Zuchs insists that he regrets his actions and that a visit by Ruth a year before inspired him to bring the Hunters together as penance. Despite a vision of Ruth attempting to talk him down, Jonah kills Zuchs and reveals the truth to the other horrified Hunters. Harriet, after having consulted with an unidentified woman, suggests to the remaining Hunters that they continue their mission in Europe. Mizushima is kidnapped and taken to [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina]], where he discovers that The Colonel is alive, her identity is [[Eva Braun]] and she is living with [[Adolf Hitler]] and four identical Aryan-looking boys.\n |LineColor       = #F4CA16\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn May 17, 2018, it was announced that [[Amazon Video]] had given the production a straight-to-series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

However, Meyer doesn't recite a prayer he'd sworn to Ruth he would if he ever caught up to the Wolf, leading a horrified Jonah to put the pieces together and realize that Meyer is actually the Wolf. Zuchs confesses, explaining that he had killed the real Meyer to take his identity and escape the Soviets while later undergoing [[plastic surgery]] (from the SS surgeon he just now killed) to complete the transformation. Having lived a Jewish life for thirty years, Zuchs insists that he regrets his actions and that a visit by Ruth a year before inspired him to bring the Hunters together as penance. Despite a vision of Ruth attempting to talk him down, Jonah kills Zuchs and reveals the truth to the other horrified Hunters. Harriet, after having consulted with an unidentified woman, suggests to the remaining Hunters that they continue their mission in Europe.

Such a name is called a '''binomial name''' (which may be shortened to just \"binomial\"), a '''binomen''', '''{{not a typo|binominal|reason=This is the alternative name in the ICZN. Do not \"correct\" it.}} name''' or a '''scientific name'''; more informally it is also called a '''Latin name'''.\n\nThe first part of the name \u2013 the ''[[generic name (biology)|generic name]]'' \u2013 identifies the [[genus]] to which the species belongs, while the second part \u2013 the '''specific name''' or '''specific epithet''' \u2013 identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' and within this genus to the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' is probably the most widely known binomial.<ref>{{cite book | author=Busby III, Arthur |display-authors=etal | title=A Guide to Rocks and Fossils | page=103 | date=1997}}</ref> The ''formal'' introduction of this system of naming species is credited to [[Carl Linnaeus]], effectively beginning with his work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref name=\"Knapp\" /> But [[Gaspard Bauhin]], in as early as 1622, had introduced in his book ''Pinax theatri botanici'' (English, ''Illustrated exposition of plants'') many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauhin|first1=Gaspard|title=Pinax theatri botanici|url=http://edb.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit-e/b07/b07cont.html|publisher=Kyoto University Library|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') for animals and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp''). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\". The name \"Linnaeus\" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of limpet; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book ''[[Systema Naturae]]'').\n**\"''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)\". The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named this bluebell species ''Scilla italica''; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''; the ''ICNafp'' does not require that the dates of either publication be specified.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe name is composed of two word-forming elements: [[wikt:bi|\"bi\"]], a [[Latin]] prefix for two, and [[wiktionary:-nomial|\"-nomial\"]], literally translated as \"name\". The word \"binomium\" was used in Medieval Latin to signify one of the terms in a two-term binomial expression in mathematics.<ref>See [https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bin%C3%B4me entry \"bin\u00f4me\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606122907/http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/bin%C3%B4me |date=6 June 2017 }} in le Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise informatis\u00e9.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Biological classification#Early systems||label 1 = Biological classification: Early systems}}\n\n[[File:Carl von Linn\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707{{ndash}}1778), a Swedish botanist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature]]\n\nPrior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long.

This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus.

However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include:\n* Latin, either [[Latin|classical]] or [[New Latin|medieval]]. Thus, both parts of the binomial name ''Homo sapiens'' are Latin words, meaning \"wise\" (''sapiens'') \"human/man\" (''Homo'').\n* [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]]. The genus ''[[Rhododendron]]'' was named by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, itself derived from ''rhodon'', \"rose\", and ''dendron'', \"tree\".<ref>{{OEtymD|rhododendron}}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|r(odo/dendron|\u1fe5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|r(o/don|\u1fe5\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd}}, {{LSJ|de/ndreon|\u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd|ref}}.</ref> Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form.

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

For example, humans belong to the genus ''[[Homo]]'' and within this genus to the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' is probably the most widely known binomial.<ref>{{cite book | author=Busby III, Arthur |display-authors=etal | title=A Guide to Rocks and Fossils | page=103 | date=1997}}</ref> The ''formal'' introduction of this system of naming species is credited to [[Carl Linnaeus]], effectively beginning with his work ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref name=\"Knapp\" /> But [[Gaspard Bauhin]], in as early as 1622, had introduced in his book ''Pinax theatri botanici'' (English, ''Illustrated exposition of plants'') many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauhin|first1=Gaspard|title=Pinax theatri botanici|url=http://edb.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit-e/b07/b07cont.html|publisher=Kyoto University Library|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') for animals and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp''). Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules.\n\nIn modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a [[proper noun]] such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text (or underlined in handwriting). Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist [[Thomas Drummond (botanist)|Thomas Drummond]]) is now written as ''[[Phlox drummondii]]''.\n\nIn scientific works, the [[Binomial nomenclature#Authority|authority]] for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified.\n*In [[zoology]]\n** \"''[[Patella vulgata]]'' Linnaeus, 1758\".

The original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; the parentheses indicate that the species is now considered to belong in a different genus. The ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made, although nomenclatorial catalogs usually include such information.\n*In [[botany]]\n**\"''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation used in botany for \"Linnaeus\".\n**\"''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.)

It can have one of a number of forms:\n* The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in [[grammatical gender|gender]]. Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The [[house sparrow]] has the binomial name ''Passer domesticus''. Here ''domesticus'' (\"domestic\") simply means \"associated with the house\". The [[Nandina|sacred bamboo]] is ''Nandina domestic<u>a</u>''<ref>{{Harvnb|Hyam|Pankhurst|1995|p=334}}</ref> rather than ''Nandina domestic<u>us</u>'', since ''Nandina'' is feminine whereas ''Passer'' is masculine. The tropical fruit [[Lansium parasiticum|langsat]] is a product of the plant ''Lansium parasitic<u>um</u>'', since ''Lansium'' is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are ''-us'', ''-a'', ''-um'' (as in the previous example of ''domesticus''); ''-is'', ''-is'', ''-e'' (e.g. ''tristis'', meaning \"sad\"); and ''-or'', ''-or'', ''-us'' (e.g. ''minor'', meaning \"smaller\"). For further information, see [[Latin declension#Adjectives|Latin declension: Adjectives]].\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is ''Panthera leo''. Grammatically the noun is said to be in [[apposition]] to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, ''Panthera'' is feminine and ''leo'' is masculine.\n[[File:Talauma hodgsonii.jpg|thumb|''Magnolia hodgsonii'']]\n* The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the [[genitive case|genitive]] (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the [[Latin declension|declension]] of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are ''-ii'' or ''-i'' in the singular and ''-orum'' in the plural, and for feminine nouns ''-ae'' in the singular and ''-arum'' in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the [[Tibetan antelope]] (''Pantholops hodgsonii''), the shrub ''[[Magnolia hodgsonii]]'', or the [[olive-backed pipit]] (''Anthus hodgsoni''). The meaning is \"of the person named\", so that ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' means \"Hodgson's magnolia\". The ''-ii'' or ''-i'' endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, ''hodgsonae'' would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example ''Anthus hodgsoni'' was named by [[Charles Wallace Richmond]], in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with ''[[Latimeria chalumnae]]'', meaning \"of the [[Chalumna River]]\". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', where ''coli'' means \"of the [[colon (anatomy)|colon]]\". This formation is common in parasites, as in ''[[Xenos vesparum]]'', where ''vesparum'' means \"of the wasps\", since ''Xenos vesparum'' is a parasite of wasps.\n\nWhereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of ''hodgsonii'' above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom.\n\n==Codes==\n\nFrom the early 19th century<!--Strickland code was 1841--> onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names.<!--CITATION--> In the course of time these became [[nomenclature codes]]. The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' (''ICZN'') governs the naming of animals,<ref name=ICZN>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}</ref> the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''ICNafp'') that of plants (including [[cyanobacteria]]), and the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (''ICNB'') that of [[bacteria]] (including [[Archaea]]). [[Virus]] names are governed by the ''[[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'' (''ICTV''), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.:\n* \"Binomial nomenclature\" is the correct term for botany,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 23</ref> although it is also used by zoologists.<ref>{{Citation |last=Schmidt |first=Diane |year=2003 |title=Guide to reference and information sources in the zoological sciences |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Libraries Unlimited |isbn=978-1-56308-977-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoreference0000schm }}, [//books.google.com/books?id=EqJrbvJU4uwC&pg=PA4 p. 4]</ref> Since 1953, \"binomi<u>n</u>al nomenclature\" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina).<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 2, Article 5</ref>\n* Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the \"generic name\". In the zoological code (''ICZN''), the second part of the name is a \"specific name\". In the botanical code (''ICNafp''), it is a \"specific epithet\". Together, these two parts are referred to as a \"species name\" or \"binomen\" in the zoological code; or \"species name\", \"binomial\", or \"binary combination\" in the botanical code. \"Species name\" is the only term common to the two codes.\n* The ''ICNafp'', the plant code, does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a [[tautonym]]), whereas the ''ICZN'', the animal code, does. Thus the American bison has the binomial ''Bison bison''; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant.\n* The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In [[botany]] the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published ''[[Species Plantarum]]''). In [[zoology]] the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', 10th Edition, and also [[Carl Alexander Clerck|Clerck's]] ''Aranei Svecici''). [[Bacteriology]] started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980.<ref>{{Citation |last=Sneath |first=P.H.A. |year=2003 |publisher=International Union of Microbiological Societies |url=http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |accessdate=20 June 2013 |title=A short history of the Bacteriological Code |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070542/http://www.the-icsp.org/misc/Code_history.htm |archivedate=24 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Summary of terminology for the names of species in the ICZN and ICNafp\n!

(There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names [[clade]]s. This is called the ''[[PhyloCode]]''.)\n\n===Differences in handling personal names===\nAs noted above, there are some differences between the codes in the way in which binomials can be formed; for example the ''ICZN'' allows both parts to be the same, while the ''ICNafp'' does not. Another difference is in the way in which personal names are used in forming specific names or epithets. The ''ICNafp'' sets out precise rules by which a personal name is to be converted to a specific epithet. In particular, names ending in a consonant (but not \"er\") are treated as first being converted into Latin by adding \"-ius\" (for a man) or \"-ia\" (for a woman), and then being made genitive (i.e. meaning \"of that person or persons\"). This produces specific epithets like ''lecardii'' for Lecard (male), ''wilsoniae'' for Wilson (female), and ''brauniarum'' for the Braun sisters.<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Recommendation 60C</ref> By contrast the ''ICZN'' does not require the intermediate creation of a Latin form of a personal name, allowing the genitive ending to added directly to the personal name.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 3.1.2</ref> This explains the difference between the names of  the plant ''Magnolia hodgsonii'' and the bird ''Anthus hodgsoni''. Furthermore, the ''ICNafp'' requires names not published in the form required by the code to be corrected to conform to it,<ref>[[#ICN2011|McNeill et al. 2011]], Article 60.12</ref> whereas the ''ICZN'' is more protective of the form used by the original author.<ref>{{Harvnb|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|1999}}, Chap. 7, Article 32.3</ref>\n\n== Writing binomial names ==\nBy tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref name=\"howto\">{{Citation |title=How to Write Scientific Names of Organisms |journal=Competition Science Vision |url = http://www.journal.au.edu/au_techno/2001/oct2001/howto.pdf |access-date=20 June 2011 |postscript=. }}</ref> Generally, the binomial should be printed in a [[font|font style]] different from that used in the normal text; for example, \"''Several more ''Homo sapiens'' fossils were discovered''.\" When handwritten, a binomial name should be underlined; for example, <u>Homo sapiens</u>.<ref name=\"tan\">{{citation |url=http://www.cdtl.nus.edu.sg/success/sl43.htm |title=Understanding and Learning Scientific Names of Species |author1=Hugh T.W.

The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany. For names governed by the ''ICZN'' the surname is usually written in full together with the date (normally only the year) of publication. The ''ICZN'' recommends that the \"original author and date of a name should be cited at least once in each work dealing with the taxon denoted by that name.\"{{sfn|International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |1999|loc=Recommendation 51a}} For names governed by the ''ICNafp'' the name is generally reduced to a standard abbreviation and the date omitted. The [[International Plant Names Index]] maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too.\n\nWhen the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ''ICNafp'' also requires the person who made the change to be given. In the ''ICNafp'', the original name is then called the [[basionym]]. Some examples:\n*(Plant) ''[[Amaranthus retroflexus]]'' L.&nbsp;\u2013 \"L.\" is the standard abbreviation for \"Linnaeus\"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name.\n*(Plant) ''[[Hyacinthoides italica]]'' (L.) Rothm.&nbsp;\u2013 Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell ''Scilla italica''; that is the basionym. [[Werner Hugo Paul Rothmaler|Rothmaler]] later transferred it to the genus ''Hyacinthoides''.\n*(Animal) ''[[Passer domesticus]]'' (Linnaeus, 1758)&nbsp;\u2013 the original name given by Linnaeus was ''Fringilla domestica''; unlike the ''ICNafp'', the ''ICZN'' does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.\n\n==Other ranks==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}\n{{main|Biological nomenclature|Trinomial nomenclature|Infraspecific name (botany)}}\n\nBinomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g., family, order, class) receive one-part names, which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, ''Passer domesticus'', belongs to the family [[Passeridae]]. Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany.\n\nRanks below species receive three-part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ''ICZN'' and the ''ICNafp''. In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the [[olive-backed pipit]] is ''Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii''. In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a \"connecting term\" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is ''Sambucus nigra'' subsp. ''canadensis''; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is ''[[Cyclamen hederifolium]]'' f. ''albiflorum''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n* [[Botanical name]]\n* [[Hybrid name (botany)]]\n* [[List of botanists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names]]\n* [[List of zoologists by author abbreviation]]\n* [[Scientific terminology]]\n* [[Species description]]\n* [[Undescribed taxon]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation |last=Hyam |first=R. |last2=Pankhurst |first2=R.J. |year=1995 |title=Plants and their names : a concise dictionary |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-866189-4 |lastauthoramp=yes }}\n*{{Citation |last=International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature |year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ''online'' |edition=4th |publisher=The International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature |isbn=978-0-85301-006-7 |url = http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/ |accessdate=20 June 2011 }}\n*{{citation |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.
