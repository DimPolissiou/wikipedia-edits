It is the flagship station of the Radyo Patrol Network owned by [[ABS-CBN]]. The station's [[studio]] is located at the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|ABS-CBN Broadcast Center]], Sgt. Esguerra Avenue, corner of Mother Ignacia St., Brgy. South Triangle, Diliman, Quezon City; its 50,000 [[watt]] [[transmitter]] is located at F. Navarette St., Brgy. Panghulo, [[Obando, Bulacan]].\n\nDZMM is also simulcast via [[The Filipino Channel]] and also has a television channel aired on [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]], and as an exclusive news channel on [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[Free-to-air|free TV]] via [[ABS-CBN TV Plus|ABS-CBN TVplus]] named ''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]]'' where the studio and hosts of its programs can be seen by its listeners and viewers. It can also be received in the United States on [[DirecTV]] Channel 2066. Some of the station's selected programming are also simulcast via satellite over (Visayas Regions) [[DYAP-AM|DYAP Radyo Patrol 765]] in [[Puerto Princesa City|Puerto Princesa, Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB Radyo Patrol 1512]] in [[Mandaue|Mandaue City]], [[Cebu]], and (Mindanao Region) [[DXAB|DXAB Radyo Patrol 1296]] in Davao City. (these stations mentioned also broadcasts local programming in-between).\n\n==History==\n===Radyo Patrol's first literation: the early years===\nIt began on October 19, 1953 when '''DZAQ''', the forerunner of DZMM was the first radio station of the former ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) of the Quirinos under [[President (government title)|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]]'s brother, Antonio (originally came from the pre-1953 experimental station DZBC), opened its doors as a radio station using the Filipino language in its broadcasts, following what DZBC had done before as the first ever radio station in Manila using Filipino instead of the English language used by other stations at that time. DZAQ 620&nbsp;kHz featured news, variety and music programs on an AM format which then the progenitor of DZAQ-TV 3. [[Eddie Ilarde]], Ike Lozada, [[German Moreno]] and [[Joey de Leon]] were the personalities of the station at that time. Its first radio studios were in Manila, sharing the same building with the television studios. In 1957, with the opening of the then new ABS radio and television studios in Pasay City, the DZAQ radio studios moved there.\n\nYears later, when ABS and the Lopez-owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) were formally merged into a single network in 1967, DZAQ 620&nbsp;kHz switched frequencies with CBN-owned [[DZXL]] 960&nbsp;kHz and was later rebranded as DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960&nbsp;kHz, one of the pre-[[martial law]] flagship AM stations of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] until 1972. [[Orly Mercado]], who was one of the station managers from 1969 to 1971, together with Ben Aniceto, came up with a vision to establish a 24-hour all-news and all-talk radio station and ABS-CBN conceptualized it under the ''Radyo Patrol'' brand - the de facto successor of the ephemeral 24 hour news station DZQL Radyo Reloj, which CBN launched in 1956 (the very year it launched), and the first ever 24-hour news radio station in the country and in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe first and original Radyo Patrol team was unceremoniously organized following the aftermath of Super Typhoon Welming (International name: Emma) in 1967, at the old ABS-CBN Radio Broadcast Center in Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, which housed the station since it was moved in 1958. Ben Aniceto, then Program Manager, and Chief Engr. Emil Solidum, created a solution to broadcast typhoon damage news from Manila and the surrounding areas. Using two VW Combis attached with a UHF transmitter, two teams of reporters were dispatched. Combi One had Al Mendez and Zoilo Paragas Jr as reporters; and Combi 2 with Bar Samson. DZQL and DZXL became the carrying stations with then current DJs Naldy Castro, Buddy Medina, Boots Baker, Mary Jane Madamba and even the late Ike Lozada alternating as anchors. Cesar Mortega was assigned to coordinate the broadcasts. The broadcasts proved to be a huge success for the corporation, and for its news service.\n\nThen came the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by that quake). This strong earthquake lead to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in the capital's downtown districts.  This was the second major news event as a progenitor to the current Radyo Patrol; this time, DZAQ took on the gargantuan task of informing the nation live as it happened. The Radyo Patrol Ruby Tower project was then handled by former DZAQ station manager [[Orly Mercado]], and veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]]; the first reporters assigned as Radyo Patrol reporters were Mercado himself, Jun Ricafrente, Mario Garcia, Chris Daluz and Ismael Reyes. The marathon radio-TV simulcast of a major coverage; the first of its kind by a Philippine media firm, was a success, and the Radyo Patrol format later became an integral part of DZAQ's broadcasts, with the station's field reporters being assigned to cover breaking news stories and then calling the station to convey these stories as they happened. Encouraged by the success of the field reports of breaking news stories in the Greater Manila Area and beyond, DZAQ was later that year converted into a 24-hour news and commentary station by orders of the corporation management, covering many national events of great importance to listeners, as DZXL took over its entertainment and music programming. At the same time, the original team of 5 field reporters was later expanded to include both young announcers (like [[Rey Langit]]) and industry news veterans. By 1971, the success of the Radyo Patrol format in Metro Manila had led to select ABS-CBN provincial radio stations establishing Radyo Patrol news services within their areas.\n\n=== Martial law period and until 1986 ===\nHowever, on the night of September 23, 1972, operations of DZAQ, DZXL, DZMM-FM, DZAQ-TV and DZXL-TV along with 4 other ABS-CBN AM radio stations were halted as Metrocom forces seized ABS-CBN Broadcasting Centre two days after President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared martial law, even DZAQ/DZXL personalities were arrested because of strict [[censorship]] as it went off the air.\n\nTwo years after the forced shut down of all radio and television stations, [[DWWW]] (Radyo Broadcast City), a crony-owned AM station of Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now known as [[Radio Philippines Network]] or RPN) began to air in 1973 which contained news, public service programs, drama and music. Veteran anchors and new recruits like Johnny de Leon, Rod Navarro, [[Joe Taruc]] and Vic Morales came into DWWW at that time. [[Dely Magpayo]], Henry Jones Ragas and [[Noli de Castro]] were among those who worked as station announcers.<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CticaESMr3s|title= DZMM: Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=DZMM TeleRadyo|date=July 22, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Marcos crony control, the station was dubbed ''Pinakamatatag sa Buong Pilipinas'' (''The strongest in the Philippines''). Following the switch from [[NARBA]]-implemented 10&nbsp;kHz to [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975|GE75]]-implemented 9&nbsp;kHz in 23 November 1978, DWWW's frequency was reassigned from 620 to 630 AM, and gained a new home in [[Broadcast City]] in Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nOn the third day of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]], reformist rebels stormed into the RPN broadcast complex and DWWW knocked off from the air following the capture of channel 4 on the morning of February 24, 1986 and Channel 9 the day after. At the end, both DWWW of RPN and DWOK of [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] were sequestered by the government with [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] getting both stations as a result.\n\n===The return of ABS-CBN===\nThe fall of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos regime]] in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of ABS-CBN in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In April 1986, then newly formed [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] handed over two radio stations, DWWW of RPN and DWOK of BBC, back to the network's control. DWWW then changed its callsign to DZMM and started preparations for the resumption of broadcasts. Lito Balquierda Jr., Vice-President for Radio, together with Attorney Jake Lopez and Mr. Ben Aniceto spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene.\n\nThe network started recruiting both experienced and new employees including a new generation of Radyo Patrol Reporters. Their studios were initially located at the Chronicle Building in Pasig (where Benpres Corporation is currently located). After days of careful planning and a period of test broadcast which took place from July 16\u201321, 1986 (alongside [[DWRR-FM|DWKO-FM 101.9]], which started broadcasting and the network's mother TV station [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]], which re-opened on September 14), DZMM officially signed on the air with the new tagline ''\"Ang Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan\"'' (Station of the Independent People) on the afternoon of July 22, 1986 at 3 pm.\n\nRene Jose (now with [[DWIZ]] and [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV]]) delivered the first sign-on spiels,<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\"/> while Magpayo (who came from DWWW) was the first ever anchor to grace the airwaves of the new station with her program ''Dear Tiya Dely'' (before she transferred to [[DZRH]] to continue her program until her death in September 2008), followed by other broadcast icons like Jun Ricafrente (who also became one of the original reporters of the pre-Martial Law Radyo Patrol era), Cesar Mortega, Ric Tierro and de Castro, newly recruited women [[Mel Tiangco]] (now with [[GMA Network]]) and Angelique Lazo (now with [[DZRV-AM|Radyo Veritas]] and [[People's Television Network|PTV]]), as well as [[Ernie Baron]] and Kuya Cesar. [[Knowledge Power]], the first-ever full-length program of the station was launched. It was also the country's first-ever scholastic program on AM radio. Mario Garcia, who was part of the original Radyo Patrol core and recruited from [[DWAN-AM|DWAN 1206]], was the first station manager, months after its reopening.<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\"/>\n\nIt was only in 1987 that the station was transferred to its current studios inside the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Quezon City from the former Chronicle Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig City. During its first years of operations, DZMM operated from sign-on to sign-off on a 19-hour-a-day to 20-hour-a-day schedule during that time.\n\nIn 1987, the first ever tandem on local AM radio was introduced. Mel Tiangco and [[Jay Sonza]] were the hosts of ''[[Mel & Jay]]'' and immediately became a hit to the listeners and lasted for a couple of years. It was also in the same year when DZMM build a remarkable roster of radio talents, including [[Ted Failon]], [[Korina Sanchez]], [[Frankie Evangelista]], Gel Santos-Relos, Ernie Angeles (who also served its station's voice over during its first decade of operations), Neil Ocampo (now with [[DZXL|DZXL 558 AM]]) and Jake Maderazo (now with [[DZIQ|Radyo Inquirer 990]]).<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo2>{{YouTube | id= 6vNAdlbJ7ZQ | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (2 OF 5) }}</ref>\n\nAs it was in the past, DZMM held on the tradition of the stalwart ABS-CBN Radyo Patrol (field reporters) of the '60s and early '70s to further develop the station's capabilities in serving the public. Jun Ricafrente, Radyo Patrol #3 (later transferred to Vic de Leon-Lima), one of the original members of the team, started training new recruits. The first of the 2nd generation reporters to be selected were RP #2 Claude Vitug, RP #4 Emil Recometa, RP #1 Lito Villarosa and RP #5 Neil Ocampo.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970717121954/http://www.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/radshows/dzmm/aboutdzmm.html#birth#birth Abs-Cbn \u2013 Dzmm Main]</ref>\n\nIt was also in this year when military insurgents took over the station during the 1987 coup attempts. However, this did not stop DZMM from delivering news to the public, the booth was moved to then undisclosed location and immediately resumed broadcasting.\n\nIn 1989, DZMM eventually evolved into a 24-hour round-the-clock broadcast service, in keeping up with the demands of delivering the news to the listeners.\n\nFailon, who is known for his distinct style of broadcasting, changed the landscape of Philippine radio broadcasting as he joined DZMM's roster of broadcasters the following year. And at the same time, he had a program with the station entitled ''Gising Pilipinas'' (originally known as Good Morning Pilipinas; unrelated to the now defunct morning show aired on [[PTV-4]]), formerly aired everyday at 2\u20134 am.\n\n===News coverages and events===\nSince 1986, DZMM reporters covered the biggest events in the late 80s and the early 90s like the [[Mendiola Massacre|Mendiola riot]], [[1986-1987 Philippine coup attempts|August 1987 coup]], [[Typhoon Nina (1987)|Supertyphoon Sisang]], [[MV Do\u00f1a Paz|MV Do\u00f1a Paz tragedy]], death of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|December 1989 Christmas coup]], [[1990 Luzon earthquake|Luzon earthquake]], [[Mount Pinatubo|Mt. Pinatubo eruption]] and [[Gulf War]]. All of these were witnessed and listened on AM radio to listeners, together with [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News team]] of reporters.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo2\"/> These reports would be a source of pride for the station, reaping high praise from the public for its live and accurate reporting of news stories.\n\n===Public service on radio===\nIn 1991, ''[[Aksyon Ngayon (DZMM program)|Aksyon Ngayon (Action Now)]]'', the first ever program on AM radio devoted solely to public service was created.<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo3>{{YouTube | id= wl_e-TwkGJA | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (3 OF 5) }}</ref> First anchored by [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]], ''Aksyon Ngayon'' instantly soared to the top of the ratings list. Because of the thousands of less-fortunate ''Kapamilya'' listeners flocking the station asking for assistance from the program, the executives decided to create ''DZMM Public Service Center'', the first ever separate office exclusively created for public service by a local AM station. However, ''Aksyon Ngayon'' aired its final broadcast on December 30, 2016, and is now replaced by ''[[ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation|ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya]] sa DZMM'', now hosted by Julius Babao and [[Bernadette Sembrano]].\n\nOn November 5, 1993, DZMM launched ''Pulis, Pulis Kung Umaksiyon, Mabilis''. The program was first anchored by broadcast icons, Kabayan [[Noli de Castro]], [[Jay Sonza]], and [[Mel Tiangco]]. It was created to keep the public informed on the activities of the [[Philippine National Police]]. It also became a venue for comments and grievances of the listening public on issues concerning the law enforcers.\n\nIn 1996, DZMM became the first AM station in the Philippines to be made available in the World Wide Web with its inclusion in [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] website. All programs of the stations are broadcast live and can be enjoyed by all Filipinos around the world via [[The Filipino Channel|The Filipino Channel (TFC)]].<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo3\"/>\n\n===New slogan, Sky Patrol===\nIn 1998, from ''Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan'', DZMM, under the leadership of de Castro, then Vice-President for Radio Network Division, was re-launched as ''DZMM Radyo Patrol 630'' (named as counterpart of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN's]] [[TV Patrol|flagship primetime newscast]], which de Castro is by then main anchor until 2001 and from 2010). By the end of 1999, DZMM moved its transmitting facilities from Libis, Caloocan City since before martial law to the state-of-the-art 50,000-watt transmission equipment were moved to Obando, Bulacan.\n\nOn September 14, 1998, ''ABS-CBN Sky Patrol'', the first-ever news [[Helicopter|chopper]] in the country, was launched. Anchored by Ricky Velasco, Sky Patrol changed the way of delivering and gathering news.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo3\"/> ABS-CBN Sky Patrol is the news chopper of DZMM, [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] and the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]]. As of 2016, the Sky Patrol is not used anymore by the network and its sister stations; it was replaced by video drones as of 2017.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Kabayan===\nSince 1986, ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' is the longest-running radio program hosted by de Castro allowing to place a timeslot after ''DZMM Balita'' which focused on issues related to political and social situation.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo2\"/> In February 2001, the last episodes of ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' aired. At the time, it was DZMM's top-rating morning radio program. The show had to end its run in order to allow de Castro to run for the [[Philippine Senate|Senate]] and the program was replaced by ''[[Todo Balita]]'' with RP #5 Neil Ocampo until 2010, when the show ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' officially returned to DZMM, with De Castro as the current host on Weekdays.\n\nIn 2001, DZMM celebrated its 15th anniversary of broadcasting on-air by adapting its richly deserved positioner, \"Una sa Balita, Una sa Public Service\" (First in News, First in Public Service). It was also on the same year when the station tapped the power of text messaging with DZMM ''TxtPatrol'' (via 2366).<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo4>{{YouTube | id= -sstbFuMXDc | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (4 OF 5) }}</ref>\n\nDZMM's trademark drama theatre aired weekday afternoons, changing the way people perceived radio drama. The drama theatre featured the real life-stories of DZMM anchors like Bro. Jun Banaag, Joey Galvez, Sen. [[Alfredo Lim]], and other personalities. It was also on the same year when ''Sports Talk'' was launched. This jam-packed sports-oriented program won CMMA's Best Sports Program on its first year of airing. ''Sports Talk'' was later renamed as ''Fastbreak'' since 2014.\n\nIn 2005, listeners\u2019 first heard the DZMM theme. It was composed by Jessie Lasaten, with words of Bing Palao, Robert Labayen, and Peter Mus\u00f1gi (former host of \"Teka Muna\", then later became the new host of ''Pasada Sais Trenta'', and consultant of ABS-CBN Sports and the current voiceover of the network), and sung by Reuben Laurente, a former member of the music group ''The Company''.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, ''SikaPinoy'' was conferred with the Anvil Award of Merit by the celebrated Anvil Awards of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP).\n\n===2006\u20132010===\nIt was also in 2006 when DZMM celebrated its 20th Anniversary in Araneta Coliseum with a bang- dubbed as ''Happy 20 DZMM''. The theme of DZMM was given a different twist with [[Sharon Cuneta]] singing the anthem.\n\nTeleRadyo is first televised via [[SkyCable]] channel 22 (then later channel 26), then later expanded on other cable providers and until eventually on the [[ABS-CBN TV Plus|ABS-CBN TVplus]] as an exclusive news channel on [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[Free-to-air|free TV]].\n\nIn 2010, for the first time in Philippine radio history, DZMM and its rival station [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]] of [[GMA Network]] made history as they joined forces in the name of public service, when they had two children named James and Jesus Bantillan, asked for help to find the missing parents named Pascual and Norma Bantillan from Bohol on the now defunct ''Aksyon Ngayon'' and eventually reunited through the defunct rival program ''Aksyon Oro Mismo'' of DZBB.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSaM4DYSwAw | title = DZMM at DZBB, nagkaisa sa public service! | accessdate=2015-02-02 | publisher=YouTube | date=2015-02-02}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u20132016===\nOn February 25, 2011, DZMM introduced their tagline ''Silveradyo'', celebrating their 25th anniversary.

The radio program temporarily went off the air in 2013, but returned in 2014 after the onslaught of [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]]. Because of this, the program became popular for its slogan ''Ligtas ang May Alam'', and held various contests like ''Alert U'' and held the ''Red Alert Emergency Expo''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abscbnpr.com/dzmm-holds-red-alert-emergency-expo/ | title=DZMM Holds Red Alert Emergency Expo| accessdate=April 15, 2015|publisher=ABS-CBN | date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> ''Red Alert'' also became a TV program as a segment in ''[[Pinoy True Stories]]'' every Wednesday (formerly airs on Friday).

The hacking of the site did not affect their social media accounts nor the operations of the station and TeleRadyo, but did affect live streaming. The hacked website was later taken down by the mother network [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] and later replaced by a message that the site was down due to ''[[Web traffic|heavy traffic]]''; days later the site was redirected to the main page of ABS-CBN News, but later replaced with a newer DZMM website (news.abs-cbn.com/dzmm/home).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yugatech.com/news/dzmm-abs-cbn-hacked-by-anonymous-ph-and-bloodsec-international/ |title=DZMM, ABS-CBN hacked by Anonymous PH and Bloodsec International |publisher=Yugatech |date=April 19, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422165643/http://www.yugatech.com/news/dzmm-abs-cbn-hacked-by-anonymous-ph-and-bloodsec-international/ |archivedate=April 22, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/dzmms-online-portal-hacked/|title=DZMM website hacked|newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=April 19, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===30th Anniversary (2016)===\nIn 2016, DZMM 630 celebrated its 30th anniversary on the airwaves since its inception in 1986.

On the same day, the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]], as a emergency measure, temporary simulcasts DZMM programs to local and international viewers but with own commercials, cutting its feed for the flagship ''Top Story''.\n\nOn March 19, 2020, DZMM, formally stops temporary the replay broadcasts of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (which began Monday as a result of the decision for the temporary halt of broadcasts of ''Good Vibes'') and replaces them with a news simulcast from the ABS-CBN News Channel, another unprecedended decision, thus DZMM becomes the first radio station in many years, since the end of English broadcasts on [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ]] in the 2010s, to air English language news programming on the AM brand and by extention DZMM Teleradyo becomes a pioneer in airing bilingual (Filipino and English) news programming in both cable and digital FTA television. The English broadcasts air from 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (following ''Headline Pilipinas'') to 10:00&nbsp;p.m., Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, with ANC's relay of DZMM programs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. following ''[[Early Edition (TV program)|Early Edition]]''), with a break at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. for ''[[Market Edge with Cathy Yang|Market Edge]]'' during trading days in the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] and 5:00&nbsp;p.m. for ''Top Story''. With this decision, DZMM Teleradyo airs ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV program)|The World Tonight]]'' for the first time on FTA digital television on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday nights for the first time since 1999, while taking a 6:30&nbsp;p.m. break for the live simulcast of ''TV Patrol'' (weekdays only).

On the same day, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo has switched to simultaneous telecast with the English language ABS-CBN News Channel starting at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. As DZMM temporarily suspended its regular programming after asking all concerned on-duty personnel to go on self-quarantine for 14 days following their exposure to two Persons Under Investigation. The studio and facilities of DZMM have been vacated and will be immediately disinfected. Those who have not been exposed shall work from home. With this move, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo, as well as the provincial regional AM radio station, become English-only (for the first time in history after many years) as a provisional measure. From 5:30&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m., the channel aired the best of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming in their place with a 6:30&nbsp;p.m. break for ''TV Patrol''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/01/20/read-statement-on-the-simultaneous-telecast-of-dzmm-dzmm-teleradyo-on-anc | title=READ: Statement on the simultaneous telecast of DZMM, DZMM Teleradyo on ANC | publisher=[[ABS CBN News]] | date=April 1, 2020 | accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn April 3, 2020, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo resumes transmissions, with almost all programming are now aired via the Zoom platform, but with ANC commercials instead of channel commercials.\n\n==Programs==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by DZMM}}\n\n==Notable personalities==\n*[[Gus Abelgas]]\n*[[Eduardo A\u00f1o]]\n*[[Kim Atienza]]\n*[[Julius Babao]]\n*[[Doris Bigornia]]\n*[[Jeff Canoy]]\n*[[Winnie Cordero]]\n*[[Ni\u00f1a Corpuz]]\n*[[Noli de Castro]]\n*[[Ogie Diaz]]\n*[[Alvin Elchico]]\n*[[Ted Failon]]\n*[[Gretchen Fullido]]\n*[[Joey Lina]]\n*[[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]]\n*[[Tina Marasigan]]\n*[[Peter Musngi]] \n*[[Ambet Nabus]]\n*[[Henry Omaga-Diaz]]\n*[[Amy Perez]]\n*[[Cory Quirino]]\n*[[Bo Sanchez]]\n*[[Charo Santos|Charo Santos-Concio]] \n*[[Bernadette Sembrano]]\n*[[Anthony Taberna]]\n*[[Lorenzo Ta\u00f1ada III]]\n*[[Ariel Ureta]]\n*[[Freddie Webb]]\n*Tim Orbos\n*Tony Velasquez\n*Jeffrey Hernaez\n*Johnson Manabat\n*Gerry Baja\n*RC Dalaguit\n*Melanie Severino\n*Dra.

It is the flagship station of the Radyo Patrol Network owned by [[ABS-CBN]]. The station's [[studio]] is located at the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center|ABS-CBN Broadcast Center]], Sgt. Esguerra Avenue, corner of Mother Ignacia St., Brgy. South Triangle, Diliman, Quezon City; its 50,000 [[watt]] [[transmitter]] is located at F. Navarette St., Brgy. Panghulo, [[Obando, Bulacan]].\n\nDZMM is also simulcast via [[The Filipino Channel]] and also has a television channel aired on [[Sky Cable]], [[Destiny Cable]] and [[Sky Direct]], and as an exclusive news channel on [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[Free-to-air|free TV]] via [[ABS-CBN TV Plus|ABS-CBN TVplus]] named ''[[DZMM TeleRadyo]]'' where the studio and hosts of its programs can be seen by its listeners and viewers. It can also be received in the United States on [[DirecTV]] Channel 2066. Some of the station's selected programming are also simulcast via satellite over (Visayas Regions) [[DYAP-AM|DYAP Radyo Patrol 765]] in [[Puerto Princesa City|Puerto Princesa, Palawan]], [[DYAB-AM|DYAB Radyo Patrol 1512]] in [[Mandaue|Mandaue City]], [[Cebu]], and (Mindanao Region) [[DXAB|DXAB Radyo Patrol 1296]] in Davao City. (these stations mentioned also broadcasts local programming in-between).\n\n==History==\n===Radyo Patrol's first literation: the early years===\nIt began on October 19, 1953 when '''DZAQ''', the forerunner of DZMM was the first radio station of the former ABS (Alto Broadcasting System) of the Quirinos under [[President (government title)|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]]'s brother, Antonio (originally came from the pre-1953 experimental station DZBC), opened its doors as a radio station using the Filipino language in its broadcasts, following what DZBC had done before as the first ever radio station in Manila using Filipino instead of the English language used by other stations at that time. DZAQ 620&nbsp;kHz featured news, variety and music programs on an AM format which then the progenitor of DZAQ-TV 3. [[Eddie Ilarde]], Ike Lozada, [[German Moreno]] and [[Joey de Leon]] were the personalities of the station at that time. Its first radio studios were in Manila, sharing the same building with the television studios. In 1957, with the opening of the then new ABS radio and television studios in Pasay City, the DZAQ radio studios moved there.\n\nYears later, when ABS and the Lopez-owned Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) were formally merged into a single network in 1967, DZAQ 620&nbsp;kHz switched frequencies with CBN-owned [[DZXL]] 960&nbsp;kHz and was later rebranded as DZAQ Radyo Patrol 960&nbsp;kHz, one of the pre-[[martial law]] flagship AM stations of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] until 1972. [[Orly Mercado]], who was one of the station managers from 1969 to 1971, together with Ben Aniceto, came up with a vision to establish a 24-hour all-news and all-talk radio station and ABS-CBN conceptualized it under the ''Radyo Patrol'' brand - the de facto successor of the ephemeral 24 hour news station DZQL Radyo Reloj, which CBN launched in 1956 (the very year it launched), and the first ever 24-hour news radio station in the country and in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe first and original Radyo Patrol team was unceremoniously organized following the aftermath of Super Typhoon Welming (International name: Emma) in 1967, at the old ABS-CBN Radio Broadcast Center in Aduana Street, Intramuros, Manila, which housed the station since it was moved in 1958. Ben Aniceto, then Program Manager, and Chief Engr. Emil Solidum, created a solution to broadcast typhoon damage news from Manila and the surrounding areas. Using two VW Combis attached with a UHF transmitter, two teams of reporters were dispatched. Combi One had Al Mendez and Zoilo Paragas Jr as reporters; and Combi 2 with Bar Samson. DZQL and DZXL became the carrying stations with then current DJs Naldy Castro, Buddy Medina, Boots Baker, Mary Jane Madamba and even the late Ike Lozada alternating as anchors. Cesar Mortega was assigned to coordinate the broadcasts. The broadcasts proved to be a huge success for the corporation, and for its news service.\n\nThen came the [[1968 Casiguran earthquake|magnitude 7.6 earthquake in Casiguran]] (in which [[Manila]] was severely affected by that quake). This strong earthquake lead to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in the capital's downtown districts.  This was the second major news event as a progenitor to the current Radyo Patrol; this time, DZAQ took on the gargantuan task of informing the nation live as it happened. The Radyo Patrol Ruby Tower project was then handled by former DZAQ station manager [[Orly Mercado]], and veteran broadcaster [[Joe Taruc]]; the first reporters assigned as Radyo Patrol reporters were Mercado himself, Jun Ricafrente, Mario Garcia, Chris Daluz and Ismael Reyes. The marathon radio-TV simulcast of a major coverage; the first of its kind by a Philippine media firm, was a success, and the Radyo Patrol format later became an integral part of DZAQ's broadcasts, with the station's field reporters being assigned to cover breaking news stories and then calling the station to convey these stories as they happened. Encouraged by the success of the field reports of breaking news stories in the Greater Manila Area and beyond, DZAQ was later that year converted into a 24-hour news and commentary station by orders of the corporation management, covering many national events of great importance to listeners, as DZXL took over its entertainment and music programming. At the same time, the original team of 5 field reporters was later expanded to include both young announcers (like [[Rey Langit]]) and industry news veterans. By 1971, the success of the Radyo Patrol format in Metro Manila had led to select ABS-CBN provincial radio stations establishing Radyo Patrol news services within their areas.\n\n=== Martial law period and until 1986 ===\nHowever, on the night of September 23, 1972, operations of DZAQ, DZXL, DZMM-FM, DZAQ-TV and DZXL-TV along with 4 other ABS-CBN AM radio stations were halted as Metrocom forces seized ABS-CBN Broadcasting Centre two days after President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared martial law, even DZAQ/DZXL personalities were arrested because of strict [[censorship]] as it went off the air.\n\nTwo years after the forced shut down of all radio and television stations, [[DWWW]] (Radyo Broadcast City), a crony-owned AM station of Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now known as [[Radio Philippines Network]] or RPN) began to air in 1973 which contained news, public service programs, drama and music. Veteran anchors and new recruits like Johnny de Leon, Rod Navarro, [[Joe Taruc]] and Vic Morales came into DWWW at that time. [[Dely Magpayo]], Henry Jones Ragas and [[Noli de Castro]] were among those who worked as station announcers.<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CticaESMr3s|title= DZMM: Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=DZMM TeleRadyo|date=July 22, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Marcos crony control, the station was dubbed ''Pinakamatatag sa Buong Pilipinas'' (''The strongest in the Philippines''). Following the switch from [[NARBA]]-implemented 10&nbsp;kHz to [[Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975|GE75]]-implemented 9&nbsp;kHz in 23 November 1978, DWWW's frequency was reassigned from 620 to 630 AM, and gained a new home in [[Broadcast City]] in Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nOn the third day of the [[People Power Revolution|1986 EDSA Revolution]], reformist rebels stormed into the RPN broadcast complex and DWWW knocked off from the air following the capture of channel 4 on the morning of February 24, 1986 and Channel 9 the day after. At the end, both DWWW of RPN and DWOK of [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] were sequestered by the government with [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] getting both stations as a result.\n\n===The return of ABS-CBN===\nThe fall of the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos regime]] in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution had paved the way for the return of ABS-CBN in the Philippine broadcasting scene. In April 1986, then newly formed [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] handed over two radio stations, DWWW of RPN and DWOK of BBC, back to the network's control. DWWW then changed its callsign to DZMM and started preparations for the resumption of broadcasts. Lito Balquierda Jr., Vice-President for Radio, together with Attorney Jake Lopez and Mr. Ben Aniceto spearheaded the return of the giant network to the local broadcasting scene.\n\nThe network started recruiting both experienced and new employees including a new generation of Radyo Patrol Reporters. Their studios were initially located at the Chronicle Building in Pasig (where Benpres Corporation is currently located). After days of careful planning and a period of test broadcast which took place from July 16\u201321, 1986 (alongside [[DWRR-FM|DWKO-FM 101.9]], which started broadcasting and the network's mother TV station [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]], which re-opened on September 14), DZMM officially signed on the air with the new tagline ''\"Ang Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan\"'' (Station of the Independent People) on the afternoon of July 22, 1986 at 3 pm.\n\nRene Jose (now with [[DWIZ]] and [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV]]) delivered the first sign-on spiels,<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\"/> while Magpayo (who came from DWWW) was the first ever anchor to grace the airwaves of the new station with her program ''Dear Tiya Dely'' (before she transferred to [[DZRH]] to continue her program until her death in September 2008), followed by other broadcast icons like Jun Ricafrente (who also became one of the original reporters of the pre-Martial Law Radyo Patrol era), Cesar Mortega, Ric Tierro and de Castro, newly recruited women [[Mel Tiangco]] (now with [[GMA Network]]) and Angelique Lazo (now with [[DZRV-AM|Radyo Veritas]] and [[People's Television Network|PTV]]), as well as [[Ernie Baron]] and Kuya Cesar. [[Knowledge Power]], the first-ever full-length program of the station was launched. It was also the country's first-ever scholastic program on AM radio. Mario Garcia, who was part of the original Radyo Patrol core and recruited from [[DWAN-AM|DWAN 1206]], was the first station manager, months after its reopening.<ref name=\"Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada\"/>\n\nIt was only in 1987 that the station was transferred to its current studios inside the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center in Quezon City from the former Chronicle Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig City. During its first years of operations, DZMM operated from sign-on to sign-off on a 19-hour-a-day to 20-hour-a-day schedule during that time.\n\nIn 1987, the first ever tandem on local AM radio was introduced. Mel Tiangco and [[Jay Sonza]] were the hosts of ''[[Mel & Jay]]'' and immediately became a hit to the listeners and lasted for a couple of years. It was also in the same year when DZMM build a remarkable roster of radio talents, including [[Ted Failon]], [[Korina Sanchez]], [[Frankie Evangelista]], Gel Santos-Relos, Ernie Angeles (who also served its station's voice over during its first decade of operations), Neil Ocampo (now with [[DZXL|DZXL 558 AM]]) and Jake Maderazo (now with [[DZIQ|Radyo Inquirer 990]]).<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo2>{{YouTube | id= 6vNAdlbJ7ZQ | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (2 OF 5) }}</ref>\n\nAs it was in the past, DZMM held on the tradition of the stalwart ABS-CBN Radyo Patrol (field reporters) of the '60s and early '70s to further develop the station's capabilities in serving the public. Jun Ricafrente, Radyo Patrol #3 (later transferred to Vic de Leon-Lima), one of the original members of the team, started training new recruits. The first of the 2nd generation reporters to be selected were RP #2 Claude Vitug, RP #4 Emil Recometa, RP #1 Lito Villarosa and RP #5 Neil Ocampo.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970717121954/http://www.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/radshows/dzmm/aboutdzmm.html#birth#birth Abs-Cbn \u2013 Dzmm Main]</ref>\n\nIt was also in this year when military insurgents took over the station during the 1987 coup attempts. However, this did not stop DZMM from delivering news to the public, the booth was moved to then undisclosed location and immediately resumed broadcasting.\n\nIn 1989, DZMM eventually evolved into a 24-hour round-the-clock broadcast service, in keeping up with the demands of delivering the news to the listeners.\n\nFailon, who is known for his distinct style of broadcasting, changed the landscape of Philippine radio broadcasting as he joined DZMM's roster of broadcasters the following year. And at the same time, he had a program with the station entitled ''Gising Pilipinas'' (originally known as Good Morning Pilipinas; unrelated to the now defunct morning show aired on [[PTV-4]]), formerly aired everyday at 2\u20134 am.\n\n===News coverages and events===\nSince 1986, DZMM reporters covered the biggest events in the late 80s and the early 90s like the [[Mendiola Massacre|Mendiola riot]], [[1986-1987 Philippine coup attempts|August 1987 coup]], [[Typhoon Nina (1987)|Supertyphoon Sisang]], [[MV Do\u00f1a Paz|MV Do\u00f1a Paz tragedy]], death of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|December 1989 Christmas coup]], [[1990 Luzon earthquake|Luzon earthquake]], [[Mount Pinatubo|Mt. Pinatubo eruption]] and [[Gulf War]]. All of these were witnessed and listened on AM radio to listeners, together with [[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News team]] of reporters.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo2\"/> These reports would be a source of pride for the station, reaping high praise from the public for its live and accurate reporting of news stories.\n\n===Public service on radio===\nIn 1991, ''[[Aksyon Ngayon (DZMM program)|Aksyon Ngayon (Action Now)]]'', the first ever program on AM radio devoted solely to public service was created.<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo3>{{YouTube | id= wl_e-TwkGJA | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (3 OF 5) }}</ref> First anchored by [[Korina Sanchez]] and [[Ted Failon]], ''Aksyon Ngayon'' instantly soared to the top of the ratings list. Because of the thousands of less-fortunate ''Kapamilya'' listeners flocking the station asking for assistance from the program, the executives decided to create ''DZMM Public Service Center'', the first ever separate office exclusively created for public service by a local AM station. However, ''Aksyon Ngayon'' aired its final broadcast on December 30, 2016, and is now replaced by ''[[ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya Foundation|ABS-CBN Lingkod Kapamilya]] sa DZMM'', now hosted by Julius Babao and [[Bernadette Sembrano]].\n\nOn November 5, 1993, DZMM launched ''Pulis, Pulis Kung Umaksiyon, Mabilis''. The program was first anchored by broadcast icons, Kabayan [[Noli de Castro]], [[Jay Sonza]], and [[Mel Tiangco]]. It was created to keep the public informed on the activities of the [[Philippine National Police]]. It also became a venue for comments and grievances of the listening public on issues concerning the law enforcers.\n\nIn 1996, DZMM became the first AM station in the Philippines to be made available in the World Wide Web with its inclusion in [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] website. All programs of the stations are broadcast live and can be enjoyed by all Filipinos around the world via [[The Filipino Channel|The Filipino Channel (TFC)]].<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo3\"/>\n\n===New slogan, Sky Patrol===\nIn 1998, from ''Himpilan ng Malayang Mamamayan'', DZMM, under the leadership of de Castro, then Vice-President for Radio Network Division, was re-launched as ''DZMM Radyo Patrol 630'' (named as counterpart of [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN's]] [[TV Patrol|flagship primetime newscast]], which de Castro is by then main anchor until 2001 and from 2010). By the end of 1999, DZMM moved its transmitting facilities from Libis, Caloocan City since before martial law to the state-of-the-art 50,000-watt transmission equipment were moved to Obando, Bulacan.\n\nOn September 14, 1998, ''ABS-CBN Sky Patrol'', the first-ever news [[Helicopter|chopper]] in the country, was launched. Anchored by Ricky Velasco, Sky Patrol changed the way of delivering and gathering news.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo3\"/> ABS-CBN Sky Patrol is the news chopper of DZMM, [[ABS-CBN (television network)|ABS-CBN]] and the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]]. As of 2016, the Sky Patrol is not used anymore by the network and its sister stations; it was replaced by video drones as of 2017.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Kabayan===\nSince 1986, ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' is the longest-running radio program hosted by de Castro allowing to place a timeslot after ''DZMM Balita'' which focused on issues related to political and social situation.<ref name=\"dzmmsilveradyo2\"/> In February 2001, the last episodes of ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' aired. At the time, it was DZMM's top-rating morning radio program. The show had to end its run in order to allow de Castro to run for the [[Philippine Senate|Senate]] and the program was replaced by ''[[Todo Balita]]'' with RP #5 Neil Ocampo until 2010, when the show ''Kabayan (Kapangyarihan ng Mamamayan, Balita at Talakayan)'' officially returned to DZMM, with De Castro as the current host on Weekdays.\n\nIn 2001, DZMM celebrated its 15th anniversary of broadcasting on-air by adapting its richly deserved positioner, \"Una sa Balita, Una sa Public Service\" (First in News, First in Public Service). It was also on the same year when the station tapped the power of text messaging with DZMM ''TxtPatrol'' (via 2366).<ref name=dzmmsilveradyo4>{{YouTube | id= -sstbFuMXDc | title= DZMM Silveradyo Special Report (4 OF 5) }}</ref>\n\nDZMM's trademark drama theatre aired weekday afternoons, changing the way people perceived radio drama. The drama theatre featured the real life-stories of DZMM anchors like Bro. Jun Banaag, Joey Galvez, Sen. [[Alfredo Lim]], and other personalities. It was also on the same year when ''Sports Talk'' was launched. This jam-packed sports-oriented program won CMMA's Best Sports Program on its first year of airing. ''Sports Talk'' was later renamed as ''Fastbreak'' since 2014.\n\nIn 2005, listeners\u2019 first heard the DZMM theme. It was composed by Jessie Lasaten, with words of Bing Palao, Robert Labayen, and Peter Mus\u00f1gi (former host of \"Teka Muna\", then later became the new host of ''Pasada Sais Trenta'', and consultant of ABS-CBN Sports and the current voiceover of the network), and sung by Reuben Laurente, a former member of the music group ''The Company''.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, ''SikaPinoy'' was conferred with the Anvil Award of Merit by the celebrated Anvil Awards of the Public Relations Society of the Philippines (PRSP).\n\n===2006\u20132010===\nIt was also in 2006 when DZMM celebrated its 20th Anniversary in Araneta Coliseum with a bang- dubbed as ''Happy 20 DZMM''. The theme of DZMM was given a different twist with [[Sharon Cuneta]] singing the anthem.\n\nTeleRadyo is first televised via [[SkyCable]] channel 22 (then later channel 26), then later expanded on other cable providers and until eventually on the [[ABS-CBN TV Plus|ABS-CBN TVplus]] as an exclusive news channel on [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[Free-to-air|free TV]].\n\nIn 2010, for the first time in Philippine radio history, DZMM and its rival station [[DZBB-AM|DZBB]] of [[GMA Network]] made history as they joined forces in the name of public service, when they had two children named James and Jesus Bantillan, asked for help to find the missing parents named Pascual and Norma Bantillan from Bohol on the now defunct ''Aksyon Ngayon'' and eventually reunited through the defunct rival program ''Aksyon Oro Mismo'' of DZBB.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSaM4DYSwAw | title = DZMM at DZBB, nagkaisa sa public service! | accessdate=2015-02-02 | publisher=YouTube | date=2015-02-02}}</ref>\n\n===2011\u20132016===\nOn February 25, 2011, DZMM introduced their tagline ''Silveradyo'', celebrating their 25th anniversary. ''Takbo Para sa Karunungan'' (Literacy Run), a fun run succeeding Takbo Para sa Kalikasan, was held at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] on March 13, 2011.\n\nA trade event of DZMM was held at One Esplanade at [[SM Mall of Asia]] on May 2011.<ref name=\"NoypiTayo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.noypitayo.com/2011/05/silveradyo-marks-dzmms-25th-year/ |title=SilveRadyo marks DZMM's 25th year anniversary |accessdate=2011-06-26 |author=NoypiTayo admin |work=News |publisher=NoypiTayo |date=2011-05-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005540/http://www.noypitayo.com/2011/05/silveradyo-marks-dzmms-25th-year/ |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref>\n\nThe new station ID for the station's 25th anniversary was launched on June 12, 2011.

The hacking of the site did not affect their social media accounts nor the operations of the station and TeleRadyo, but did affect live streaming.

On the same day, the [[ABS-CBN News Channel]], as a emergency measure, temporary simulcasts DZMM programs to local and international viewers but with own commercials, cutting its feed for the flagship ''Top Story''.\n\nOn March 19, 2020, DZMM, formally stops temporary the replay broadcasts of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (which began Monday as a result of the decision for the temporary halt of broadcasts of ''Good Vibes'') and replaces them with a news simulcast from the ABS-CBN News Channel, another unprecedended decision, thus DZMM becomes the first radio station in many years, since the end of English broadcasts on [[DZRJ-AM|DZRJ]] in the 2010s, to air English language news programming on the AM brand and by extention DZMM Teleradyo becomes a pioneer in airing bilingual (Filipino and English) news programming in both cable and digital FTA television. The English broadcasts air from 1:00&nbsp;p.m. (following ''Headline Pilipinas'') to 10:00&nbsp;p.m., Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, with ANC's relay of DZMM programs on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays starting at 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. following ''[[Early Edition (TV program)|Early Edition]]''), with a break at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. for ''[[Market Edge with Cathy Yang|Market Edge]]'' during trading days in the [[Philippine Stock Exchange]] and 5:00&nbsp;p.m. for ''Top Story''. With this decision, DZMM Teleradyo airs ''[[The World Tonight (Philippine TV program)|The World Tonight]]'' for the first time on FTA digital television on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday nights for the first time since 1999, while taking a 6:30&nbsp;p.m. break for the live simulcast of ''TV Patrol'' (weekdays only). After 10:00&nbsp;p.m., DZMM 630 switches to hookup to sister station [[DWRR-FM|MOR 101.9]], while TeleRadyo continues its simulcast of ANC regardless of schedule.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, DZMM makes history with the use of video technology from [[Zoom Video Communications]] for the Friday night broadcasts of ''Labor of Love'', simulcast on ANC, making it a pioneer among the country's news channels.\n\nOn March 22, 2020, DZMM TeleRadyo moves to full 24/7 broadcasts provisionally on digital free-to-air and cable, with ANC programming being aired on Sunday late nights till 4:30&nbsp;a.m. Mondays.\n\nOn March 25, 2020, ''[[Headline Pilipinas]]'' airs for 90 minutes on DZMM Teleradyo (and on ANC on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) instead of the usual full hour as a provisional measure.\n\nOn April 1, 2020, ''Kuwentuhang Lokal'' and ''Pasada 630'' both become the first ever DZMM programs to be aired fully using the Zoom platform. On the same day, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo has switched to simultaneous telecast with the English language ABS-CBN News Channel starting at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. As DZMM temporarily suspended its regular programming after asking all concerned on-duty personnel to go on self-quarantine for 14 days following their exposure to two Persons Under Investigation. The studio and facilities of DZMM have been vacated and will be immediately disinfected. Those who have not been exposed shall work from home. With this move, DZMM and DZMM TeleRadyo, as well as the provincial regional AM radio station, become English-only (for the first time in history after many years) as a provisional measure. From 5:30&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m., the channel aired the best of ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs programming in their place with a 6:30&nbsp;p.m. break for ''TV Patrol''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/01/20/read-statement-on-the-simultaneous-telecast-of-dzmm-dzmm-teleradyo-on-anc | title=READ: Statement on the simultaneous telecast of DZMM, DZMM Teleradyo on ANC | publisher=[[ABS CBN News]] | date=April 1, 2020 | accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn April 3, 2020, DZMM Radyo Patrol 630 and DZMM TeleRadyo resumes transmissions, with almost all programming are now aired via the Zoom platform, but with ANC commercials instead of channel commercials.\n\n==Programs==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by DZMM}}\n\n==Notable personalities==\n*[[Gus Abelgas]]\n*[[Eduardo A\u00f1o]]\n*[[Kim Atienza]]\n*[[Julius Babao]]\n*[[Doris Bigornia]]\n*[[Jeff Canoy]]\n*[[Winnie Cordero]]\n*[[Ni\u00f1a Corpuz]]\n*[[Noli de Castro]]\n*[[Ogie Diaz]]\n*[[Alvin Elchico]]\n*[[Ted Failon]]\n*[[Gretchen Fullido]]\n*[[Joey Lina]]\n*[[Marc Logan (broadcast journalist)|Marc Logan]]\n*[[Tina Marasigan]]\n*[[Peter Musngi]] \n*[[Ambet Nabus]]\n*[[Henry Omaga-Diaz]]\n*[[Amy Perez]]\n*[[Cory Quirino]]\n*[[Bo Sanchez]]\n*[[Charo Santos|Charo Santos-Concio]] \n*[[Bernadette Sembrano]]\n*[[Anthony Taberna]]\n*[[Lorenzo Ta\u00f1ada III]]\n*[[Ariel Ureta]]\n*[[Freddie Webb]]\n*Tim Orbos\n*Tony Velasquez\n*Jeffrey Hernaez\n*Johnson Manabat\n*Gerry Baja\n*RC Dalaguit\n*Melanie Severino\n*Dra.

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard.

This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]], a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] briefly aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form. Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = July 26, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]].
