Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. Osmanabad city is the administrative headquarter of [[Osmanabad_district|Osmanabad District]].\n\n==History==\nThe city Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], of which the region was a part till 1948. Osmanabad's history dates way back to the era of the Ramayana where the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]] is said to have spent a few years of his exile. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.\n\nFor a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under the Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, soon in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Mumbai District. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960.\nOsmanabad has a historic lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Osmanabad has an elevation of {{Convert|653|m|ft}}.\nOsmanabad city is located in the west central part of [[Osmanabad Tahsil]], but relatively central for the district as a whole.

Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]. Osmanabad city is the administrative headquarter of [[Osmanabad_district|Osmanabad District]].\n\n==History==\nThe city Osmanabad derives its name from the last ruler of Hyderabad, the 7th Nizam, [[Mir Osman Ali Khan]], of which the region was a part till 1948. Osmanabad's history dates way back to the era of the Ramayana where the [[Hindu]] deity [[Rama]] is said to have spent a few years of his exile. As per historical evidence, the district was ruled by the Mauryas, Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, and Yadavas. In early centuries the city belonged to the Hindu Chalukyas and Devagiri Yadavas, but later became a part of the Bahmani and Bijapur kingdoms.\n\nFor a period of time, Osmanabad was also ruled by the Mughals, Bahmani, Nizam and Adil Shah kingdoms. Before the Hyderabad Nizam's rule, it was under control of the Mughal King Aurangzeb. Being under the Nizam rule, the district did not celebrate its freedom when the rest of India became independent in 1947. However, soon in 1948, Hyderabad State was merged with independent India and the district became a part of the then Mumbai District. It became a part of Maharashtra State when the State was formed in 1960.\nOsmanabad has a historic lineage dating back to the days of Marathwada and even before that to several kingdoms of which the region was a part.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Osmanabad has an elevation of {{Convert|653|m|ft}}.\nOsmanabad city is located in the west central part of [[Osmanabad Tahsil]], but relatively central for the district as a whole.

{"title_page": "Osborne bull", "text_new": "[[File:Toro Osborne Cabezas de San Juan.JPG|thumb|Osborne bull in [[Las Cabezas de San Juan]], [[Spain]].]]\nThe '''Osborne bull''' ({{lang-es|Toro de Osborne}}) is a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=on}} high black [[silhouette]]d image of a [[bull]] in semi-profile. Conservation of all 91, as of 2019, is by the F\u00e9lix Tejada family.\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Osborne Group|Osborne]] [[sherry]] company (founded by Thomas Osborne Mann in 1772) erected large images of [[bull]]s starting in 1956 to advertise their ''[[Brandy de Jerez]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2004.11.012 | volume=42 | title=El Toro de Osborne: advertising, community, and myth | journal=The Social Science Journal | pages=135\u2013140| year=2005 | last1=Johnson | first1=Carla | last2=Leatherman | first2=Alyson }}</ref> The images were black (with the brand \"''Veterano''\" in red on it) advertising boards located near major roads throughout Spain. The original image was smaller and slightly different in design. The current larger image was created to comply with a law that prohibited advertising within 150 metres of a road.\n\nIn 1994 a law that prohibited all roadside advertising of alcoholic beverages came into effect and the bulls were therefore to be removed. By this time the signs were nationally renowned and public response resulted in the signs being retained but all references to the original advertisers being removed. The Court eventually allowed these signs to remain on the grounds that they have become a part of the landscape and have \"aesthetic or cultural significance\", thus turning the bulls into [[public domain]] images.\n\nOnly two signs remain in Spain with the word \"Osborne\" still written on them. One is at the [[Jerez de la Frontera]] airport in the [[province of Cadiz]], and the other is in the nearby town of [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda]], where the Osborne headquarters is based.\n\nThe image of the bull has become widely known and can be found on stickers, post cards and other items.

The original image was smaller and slightly different in design. The current larger image was created to comply with a law that prohibited advertising within 150 metres of a road.\n\nIn 1994 a law that prohibited all roadside advertising of alcoholic beverages came into effect and the bulls were therefore to be removed. By this time the signs were nationally renowned and public response resulted in the signs being retained but all references to the original advertisers being removed. The Court eventually allowed these signs to remain on the grounds that they have become a part of the landscape and have \"aesthetic or cultural significance\", thus turning the bulls into [[public domain]] images.\n\nOnly two signs remain in Spain with the word \"Osborne\" still written on them. One is at the [[Jerez de la Frontera]] airport in the [[province of Cadiz]], and the other is in the nearby town of [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda]], where the Osborne headquarters is based.\n\nThe image of the bull has become widely known and can be found on stickers, post cards and other items.

He later became a British Fascist and fought for the [[Finnish Army]] in the [[Winter War]].\n\n==Early Years==\nWinter was born in Winchester in January 1875, the youngest of 5 sons of a controller of the General Post Office. He was educated at Churchbury House, Great Morden and later at Cheltenham College before joining the army.  \n\n==Service==\nWinter was a [[Royal Artillery]] officer and served in the India with the 67th Battery at Peshawar and in Ireland with the 131st Battery in Kildare prior to the [[First World War]]. He gained notoriety for an incident in Ireland in 1903 where he and another officer confronted a group of youths who had been harassing them whilst boating, Winter killing one with a single blow from an oar when the man attacked him with a wooden club. Subsequently charged with manslaughter Winter was acquitted by the jury on the grounds of self-defence.\n\n==First World War==\nWinter first saw action as an artillery officer during the Gallipoli campaign, arriving on W beach, Lancashire Landing on 29 April 1916 after surviving an attack on his transport, the SS Monitor, from a Turkish torpedo boat before arriving at the front. In his autobiography he recalls turning back a fleeing gun crew at revolver point on 1 May, helping to save a battalion of Royal Enniskillen Fusiliers from annihilation. Although not a trained intelligence officer he was noted for his skilful questioning of Turkish prisoners. He would later be put in charge of a 12 pounder field gun nicknamed 'Wandering Kate' and would be evacuated on 8 December. Winter later remarked that he enjoyed every minute of his service at Gallipoli. \nHe would later be deployed to the Western front, arriving in France as part of the 11th Division on 7 September and taking command of the artillery for the 34th Infantry Brigade on 24 October. He would take part in the battles for Messines Ridge on 7 June 1917 and afterwards Passchendaele. In his autobiography he recounts escaping death on several occasions and being horrified that the walls of his command bunker were shored up with the corpses of German soldiers.\n\n==Irish War of Independence==\nPost war Winter was working for the Boundary Commission for the Schleswig-Holstein when he was appointed in May 1920 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Winston Churchill]] to replace his friend General Tudor as Chief of Intelligence in Dublin Castle, taking a pay cut to accept the position.<ref>A Winter's Tale p288</ref> Winter originally was housed in a lodge outside Dublin Castle and remarked on his unconventional introduction to Ireland when his mess steward shot himself on his first night <ref>A Winter's Tale p289</ref>. Even given Winter's lack of experience in the espionage field, 'O' impressed at the time with his initial reorganisation of heavily centralised departments.  [[Mark Sturgis]] wrote of the [[Dublin Castle]] regime; \"'O' is a marvel, he looks like a wicked little white snake, is as clever as paint, probably entirely non-moral, a first class horseman, a card genius, knows several languages, is a super sleuth and a most amazing original, he can do anything\".<ref>(Sturgis papers)</ref><ref>Hopkinson The Last Days of Dublin Castle p40</ref> If nothing else he was innovative, yet his detractors claimed him to be obsessed with cloak and dagger operations, at one point donning a disguise to personally seize part of IRA funds.\n\nIn his final report to the British Government Winter listed the following as his main methods of intelligence gathering:\n# Agents obtained by local Police and through the agency of Local Centres\n# Agents recruited in England and sent to Ireland\n# Dublin Special Branch\n# Persons friendly to the Police volunteering information\n# Those persons who gave information whilst under arrest or in prison, with a view to escaping the punishment of their crimes\n# Captured documents\n# Information from ordinary Police sources based on observation\n# 'Moutons' (infiltrators) placed either in prisons or in detention cells with rebel prisoners\n# Listening sets\n# Interrogation of prisoners\n# Censorship of letters of prisoners in jail\n# Scotland House (the address to which anonymous letters were sent)<ref>P Hart (ed.), Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920\u20131921; The Final Reports.</ref>\n\nIn December 1920 Winter took charge of the 90 strong Dublin District Intelligence Service also known as the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\" possibly named after their meeting place the Cairo Cafe or possibly due to many having served in the Middle East, uniting military and police intelligence for the first time.<ref>Havoc by Paul O'Brien 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84889-306-1}} p42</ref> Amongst his plans was for potential informers to write to a secret address in England, and the net result as he freely admitted was a pile of hoaxes and abusive mail. However, amidst this mass were some valuable nuggets of genuine intelligence. As the conflict progressed letters were received purporting to come from IRA members who wished to be captured and interned in order to remove themselves from the conflict.<ref>p80 Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920-1 {{ISBN|1-85918-201-1}}</ref> He would also import bloodhounds to track fugitive IRA members and recruited female police officers from the Women's Police Service in London to search female prisoners and suspected couriers<ref>Havoc by Paul O'Brien 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84889-306-1}} p37</ref>  One informer for Winter was [[Vincent Fovargue]], an intelligence officer in the Dublin IRA who provided information which led to the arrest of several IRA members. On the 31st January 1921 Winter staged a fake escape of Fovargue from custody whilst on a lorry taking him to Kilmainham gaol. Between February and March 1921 he would successfully infiltrate the IRA in England who would suffer over 200 members arrested before the end of the conflict, providing information on their activities to Scotland Yard<ref>p 200-1 Michael Collin's Intelligence War by Michael Foy {{ISBN|0-7509-4267-3}}</ref><ref>p100 British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}}</ref>. His body was eventually found upon a golf course in Staines with the traditional message 'Spies and traitors beware.<ref>A Winter's Tale p305-6</ref>'\n\n[[F. Digby Hardy|Another was revealed]] to be a criminal fraud, uncovered not by Winter but by newspaper reporters and IRA intelligence. The IRA allowed this man to live so that he could be uncovered. Other agents were more successful. One quoted at length in led a raid that captured 3 senior IRA members writing communiques to their subordinates.<ref>Peter Hart (ed.), Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920\u20131921; The Final Reports.</ref> He rewrote the messages summoning all IRA leaders in the district to a meeting where they were arrested.  Maintaining his cover as an IRA member he was placed into custody alongside them, gaining more intelligence from their conversation in jail.\n\nAmongst Winter's other ideas was 'The Raid Bureau', a 150 strong unit dedicated to analysing the vast amounts of paperwork generated by IRA leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. An obsessive clerk, his dedication to paperwork would to some degree compromise certain activities of the IRA, revealing arms supplies, financial records and even providing lists of IRA members and the identities of traitors within the police.  Such documents were more valuable than any informer and could be presented in court as evidence which an informer would be unwilling to do.  The principal reason for lack of informers, jury, and even judges in the civil courts was intimidation, which was one of the reasons martial law was in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} From October 1920 to July 1921 6311 raids were launched capturing over 1200 IRA documents some consisting of over 200 pages and resulting in 1745 arrests in the Dublin area alone.<ref>A Winter's Tale p304-5</ref> Upon capturing the IRA's financial records Winter noted that many contributors were his own Unionist friends, forced to pay protection money. \n\nAnother innovation was collecting photographs of IRA members netted as results of raids and the establishment of Local Centres across the country allowing an exchange of intelligence between areas. Winter was able to recruit at least three leading IRA members as informers and many lesser ranks.<ref>A Winter's Tale p300</ref>To supplement the [[Cairo Gang]], Winter formed his Identification Squad also known as the [[Cairo Gang#Igoe Gang|igoe Gang]] named after its commander, [[Eugene Igoe]] a policeman from County Galway, who was expelled from Ireland after the [[Anglo-Irish War]] but would later return to Northern Ireland to provide security for US airbases in Northern Ireland from IRA sabotage during World War 2.  They were a unit of plain clothes police who had limited success in killing and capturing IRA members and a number of other young men who fell into their hands on the streets of Dublin.  Ormonde personally killed one IRA assassin and sustained a small wound to the hand whilst shooting his way out of an ambush and captured another, professing disappointment that the IRA bounty on his head was only \u00a31000.<ref>A Winter's Tale p332</ref> He would enjoy a personal meeting with David Lloyd George briefing him on the nature of the conflict.<ref>A Winter's Tale p339-341</ref> \n\nDuring the first months of 1921, Hamar Greenwood and others were declaring that the IRA was near defeat, critically short of arms and ammunition and with up to 4500 members interned in addition to hundreds more arrested. IRA leader Michael Collins later referred to the organisation as being 'dead beat' and within 'six weeks of defeat'. However, it quickly became clear that the [[British Government]] strategy of combining repression with limited concessions was still not working. Faced with the choice of either waging a war of reconquest or negotiating peace, the government chose negotiation.  A Truce was signed in July 1921, and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] in December. This proved acceptable to Irish Unionists and the British Government but caused the Irish Civil War between the pro and anti Treaty IRA forces, breaking out on 28th June 1922.<ref>^ \"The Troubles\". Claregalway Historical Society Sharing our historical & cultural heritage.</ref>\n\n==Later service==\nPost Ireland Winter was put in charge of the resettlement of former RIC officers abroad, accompanied by police bodyguards and habitually carrying a pistol for 2 years afterwards. Major General Hugh Tudor attempted to have Winter appointed as deputy chief of police for Palestine, alongside many other British veterans of the Irish conflict recruited into the Palestine Gendarmerie. However the War Office vetoed his request, Winter having been resented by General Neville Macready and others over his attaining police primacy in intelligence matters over their Army preferred candidate, Lt-Col Walter Wilson. Winter eventually retired from the army in 1924. In the 1920s Winter joined the directorship of the burgeoning but badly managed [[British Fascisti]], which held several massive rallies (12,000 at one) in the London Parks, their followers being mainly women, ex [[suffragette]] types as ''[[The Times]]'' reported.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Winter may have been an agent provocateur.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Winter replaced another British secret agent, Maxwell Knight, as head of BF intelligence but never took up his post, replaced instead by a Lieutenant-Colonel Bramley who was persuaded to keep Knight on as his deputy.<ref>Maxwell Knight, MI5's Greatest Spymaster p52 {{isbn|978-1-78475-204-0}}</ref>  \n\nThe director was Brigadier General [[Robert Byron Drury Blakeney]] ex Royal Engineers who was in part responsible for the birth of the extremist [[Imperial Fascist League]].  Through mismanagement and scandal the BF faded into obscurity in the late 1920s and membership was swallowed up by other fascist movements.  In his book Winter makes virtually no mention of this period, perhaps under the [[Official Secrets Act]].

He later became a British Fascist and fought for the [[Finnish Army]] in the [[Winter War]].\n\n==Early Years==\nWinter was born in Winchester in January 1875, the youngest of 5 sons of a controller of the General Post Office. He was educated at Churchbury House, Great Morden and later at Cheltenham College before joining the army.  \n\n==Service==\nWinter was a [[Royal Artillery]] officer and served in the India with the 67th Battery at Peshawar and in Ireland with the 131st Battery in Kildare prior to the [[First World War]]. He gained notoriety for an incident in Ireland in 1903 where he and another officer confronted a group of youths who had been harassing them whilst boating, Winter killing one with a single blow from an oar when the man attacked him with a wooden club. Subsequently charged with manslaughter Winter was acquitted by the jury on the grounds of self-defence.\n\n==First World War==\nWinter first saw action as an artillery officer during the Gallipoli campaign, arriving on W beach, Lancashire Landing on 29 April 1916 after surviving an attack on his transport, the SS Monitor, from a Turkish torpedo boat before arriving at the front. In his autobiography he recalls turning back a fleeing gun crew at revolver point on 1 May, helping to save a battalion of Royal Enniskillen Fusiliers from annihilation. Although not a trained intelligence officer he was noted for his skilful questioning of Turkish prisoners. He would later be put in charge of a 12 pounder field gun nicknamed 'Wandering Kate' and would be evacuated on 8 December. Winter later remarked that he enjoyed every minute of his service at Gallipoli. \nHe would later be deployed to the Western front, arriving in France as part of the 11th Division on 7 September and taking command of the artillery for the 34th Infantry Brigade on 24 October. He would take part in the battles for Messines Ridge on 7 June 1917 and afterwards Passchendaele. In his autobiography he recounts escaping death on several occasions and being horrified that the walls of his command bunker were shored up with the corpses of German soldiers.\n\n==Irish War of Independence==\nPost war Winter was working for the Boundary Commission for the Schleswig-Holstein when he was appointed in May 1920 by the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Winston Churchill]] to replace his friend General Tudor as Chief of Intelligence in Dublin Castle, taking a pay cut to accept the position<ref>A Winter's Tale p288</ref>. Winter originally was housed in a lodge outside Dublin Castle and remarked on his unconventional introduction to Ireland when his mess steward shot himself on his first night <ref>A Winter's Tale p289</ref>. Even given Winter's lack of experience in the espionage field, 'O' impressed at the time with his initial reorganisation of heavily centralised departments.  [[Mark Sturgis]] wrote of the [[Dublin Castle]] regime; \"'O' is a marvel, he looks like a wicked little white snake, is as clever as paint, probably entirely non-moral, a first class horseman, a card genius, knows several languages, is a super sleuth and a most amazing original, he can do anything\".<ref>(Sturgis papers)</ref><ref>Hopkinson The Last Days of Dublin Castle p40</ref> If nothing else he was innovative, yet his detractors claimed him to be obsessed with cloak and dagger operations, at one point donning a disguise to personally seize part of IRA funds.\n\nIn his final report to the British Government Winter listed the following as his main methods of intelligence gathering:\n# Agents obtained by local Police and through the agency of Local Centres\n# Agents recruited in England and sent to Ireland\n# Dublin Special Branch\n# Persons friendly to the Police volunteering information\n# Those persons who gave information whilst under arrest or in prison, with a view to escaping the punishment of their crimes\n# Captured documents\n# Information from ordinary Police sources based on observation\n# 'Moutons' (infiltrators) placed either in prisons or in detention cells with rebel prisoners\n# Listening sets\n# Interrogation of prisoners\n# Censorship of letters of prisoners in jail\n# Scotland House (the address to which anonymous letters were sent)<ref>P Hart (ed.), Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920\u20131921; The Final Reports.</ref>\n\nIn December 1920 Winter took charge of the 90 strong Dublin District Intelligence Service also known as the \"[[Cairo Gang]]\" possibly named after their meeting place the Cairo Cafe or possibly due to many having served in the Middle East, uniting military and police intelligence for the first time<ref>Havoc by Paul O'Brien 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84889-306-1}} p42</ref>. Amongst his plans was for potential informers to write to a secret address in England, and the net result as he freely admitted was a pile of hoaxes and abusive mail. However, amidst this mass were some valuable nuggets of genuine intelligence. As the conflict progressed letters were received purporting to come from IRA members who wished to be captured and interned in order to remove themselves from the conflict.<ref>p80 Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920-1 {{ISBN|1-85918-201-1}}</ref> He would also import bloodhounds to track fugitive IRA members and recruited female police officers from the Women's Police Service in London to search female prisoners and suspected couriers<ref>Havoc by Paul O'Brien 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-84889-306-1}} p37</ref>  One informer for Winter was [[Vincent Fovargue]], an intelligence officer in the Dublin IRA who provided information which led to the arrest of several IRA members. On the 31st January 1921 Winter staged a fake escape of Fovargue from custody whilst on a lorry taking him to Kilmainham gaol. Between February and March 1921 he would successfully infiltrate the IRA in England who would suffer over 200 members arrested before the end of the conflict, providing information on their activities to Scotland Yard<ref>p 200-1 Michael Collin's Intelligence War by Michael Foy {{ISBN|0-7509-4267-3}}</ref><ref>p100 British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}}</ref>. His body was eventually found upon a golf course in Staines with the traditional message 'Spies and traitors beware<ref>A Winter's Tale p305-6</ref>.'\n\n[[F. Digby Hardy|Another was revealed]] to be a criminal fraud, uncovered not by Winter but by newspaper reporters and IRA intelligence. The IRA allowed this man to live so that he could be uncovered. Other agents were more successful. One quoted at length in led a raid that captured 3 senior IRA members writing communiques to their subordinates.<ref>Peter Hart (ed.), Narratives; British Intelligence in Ireland 1920\u20131921; The Final Reports.</ref> He rewrote the messages summoning all IRA leaders in the district to a meeting where they were arrested.  Maintaining his cover as an IRA member he was placed into custody alongside them, gaining more intelligence from their conversation in jail.\n\nAmongst Winter's other ideas was 'The Raid Bureau', a 150 strong unit dedicated to analysing the vast amounts of paperwork generated by IRA leader [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. An obsessive clerk, his dedication to paperwork would to some degree compromise certain activities of the IRA, revealing arms supplies, financial records and even providing lists of IRA members and the identities of traitors within the police.  Such documents were more valuable than any informer and could be presented in court as evidence which an informer would be unwilling to do.  The principal reason for lack of informers, jury, and even judges in the civil courts was intimidation, which was one of the reasons martial law was in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} From October 1920 to July 1921 6311 raids were launched capturing over 1200 IRA documents some consisting of over 200 pages and resulting in 1745 arrests in the Dublin area alone<ref>A Winter's Tale p304-5</ref>. Upon capturing the IRA's financial records Winter noted that many contributors were his own Unionist friends, forced to pay protection money. \n\nAnother innovation was collecting photographs of IRA members netted as results of raids and the establishment of Local Centres across the country allowing an exchange of intelligence between areas. Winter was able to recruit at least three leading IRA members as informers and many lesser ranks<ref>A Winter's Tale p300</ref>.To supplement the [[Cairo Gang]], Winter formed his Identification Squad also known as the [[Cairo Gang#Igoe Gang|igoe Gang]] named after its commander, [[Eugene Igoe]] a policeman from County Galway, who was expelled from Ireland after the [[Anglo-Irish War]] but would later return to Northern Ireland to provide security for US airbases in Northern Ireland from IRA sabotage during World War 2.  They were a unit of plain clothes police who had limited success in killing and capturing IRA members and a number of other young men who fell into their hands on the streets of Dublin.  Ormonde personally killed one IRA assassin and sustained a small wound to the hand whilst shooting his way out of an ambush and captured another, professing disappointment that the IRA bounty on his head was only \u00a31000<ref>A Winter's Tale p332</ref>. He would enjoy a personal meeting with David Lloyd George briefing him on the nature of the conflict<ref>A Winter's Tale p339-341</ref>.  \n\nDuring the first months of 1921, Hamar Greenwood and others were declaring that the IRA was near defeat, critically short of arms and ammunition and with up to 4500 members interned in addition to hundreds more arrested. IRA leader Michael Collins later referred to the organisation as being 'dead beat' and within 'six weeks of defeat'. However, it quickly became clear that the [[British Government]] strategy of combining repression with limited concessions was still not working. Faced with the choice of either waging a war of reconquest or negotiating peace, the government chose negotiation.  A Truce was signed in July 1921, and the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] in December. This proved acceptable to Irish Unionists and the British Government but caused the Irish Civil War between the pro and anti Treaty IRA forces, breaking out on 28th June 1922.<ref>^ \"The Troubles\". Claregalway Historical Society Sharing our historical & cultural heritage.</ref>\n\n==Later service==\nPost Ireland Winter was put in charge of the resettlement of former RIC officers abroad, accompanied by police bodyguards and habitually carrying a pistol for 2 years afterwards. Major General Hugh Tudor attempted to have Winter appointed as deputy chief of police for Palestine, alongside many other British veterans of the Irish conflict recruited into the Palestine Gendarmerie. However the War Office vetoed his request, Winter having been resented by General Neville Macready and others over his attaining police primacy in intelligence matters over their Army preferred candidate, Lt-Col Walter Wilson. Winter eventually retired from the army in 1924. In the 1920s Winter joined the directorship of the burgeoning but badly managed [[British Fascisti]], which held several massive rallies (12,000 at one) in the London Parks, their followers being mainly women, ex [[suffragette]] types as ''[[The Times]]'' reported.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Winter may have been an agent provocateur.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Winter replaced another British secret agent, Maxwell Knight, as head of BF intelligence but never took up his post, replaced instead by a Lieutenant-Colonel Bramley who was persuaded to keep Knight on as his deputy.<ref>Maxwell Knight, MI5's Greatest Spymaster p52 {{isbn|978-1-78475-204-0}}</ref>  \n\nThe director was Brigadier General [[Robert Byron Drury Blakeney]] ex Royal Engineers who was in part responsible for the birth of the extremist [[Imperial Fascist League]].  Through mismanagement and scandal the BF faded into obscurity in the late 1920s and membership was swallowed up by other fascist movements.  In his book Winter makes virtually no mention of this period, perhaps under the [[Official Secrets Act]].  After the financial demise of the BF, he apparently took no further part in Fascist politics.\n\nIt was later rumoured that Winter was involved in plots to overthrow the Spanish government in Morocco and stage a revolution for the Slovak minority against the Czech government<ref>British Spies and Irish Rebels by Paul McMahon 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-84383-656-8}} p37</ref>. In 1940 at the age of 65, he offered his services to the [[Finnish Army]], in their defence against Communist Russia. He was honoured for his service\u2014certificates can be seen in his personal collection in the [[Imperial War Museum]]. He was a master of five Russo-Slavic languages and was a chain smoker.

In the [[shoot]], the [[shoot apical meristem]]s regularly produce new lateral organs ([[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s) and lateral branches.

In the [[shoot]], the [[shoot apical meristem]]s regularly produce new lateral organs ([[leaf|leaves]] or [[flower]]s) and lateral branches. In the [[root]], new [[lateral root]]s form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole [[pericycle]] in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''). ''In vitro'' and in response to specific cocktails of hormones (mainly [[auxin]]s and [[cytokinin]]s), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing [[Cell potency|totipotent]] stem cells called a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]].
