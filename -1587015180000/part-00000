His Son, Mr. Ardeshir Hormasji Wadia, after whom the A. H. Wadia Road was named, paid for them a yearly [[Quit-rent]] of \u00a3358 (Rs. 3587).\n\nKurla had two [[cotton mill]]s, one of them, the Dharamsi Punjabhai, being the largest cotton spinning and weaving mill in the [[Bombay Presidency]], with 92,094 spindles and 1280 looms. The other was the Kurla Spinning and Weaving Mill. Kurla village had a population of 9,715 at that time.

It operated under that name from 1873 to 1893. Prior to 1873 it was known as the '''Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad''', which had been formed by several smaller railroads dating back to 1846. After bankruptcy in 1893, the New York and New England Railroad was reorganized and became known as the '''New England Railroad''' before its 1898 lease to the competing [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]. Today, most of the original New York and New England lines have been abandoned; however a portion in Massachusetts is now part of the [[MBTA|MBTA's]] [[Franklin Line]] providing commuter rail service to [[South Station]] in [[Boston]]. The [[Connecticut Southern Railroad]] operates freight service on a small portion of the former NY&NE line near [[East Hartford]] and [[Manchester, Connecticut]]. Other portions in Connecticut and Rhode Island have been converted to [[rail trail]]s.<ref>[http://www.rigreenways.org/paths/ws-data.htm Greenways Alliance of Rhode Island]</ref>\n\nPan Am Southern operates between New Britain and Waterbury. The portion east of New Britain has been converted to a busway.\n\n==History==\n\n===West from Providence: 1846-1863===\nThe corridor from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] west into [[New York (state)|New York]] was originally chartered as three companies. The '''Providence and Plainfield Railroad''', chartered in June 1846, would run from Providence to the [[Rhode Island]]/[[Connecticut]] state line. The '''Hartford and Providence Railroad''', incorporated in May 1847, would continue west to [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the '''New York and Hartford Railroad''', chartered and incorporated in May 1845, would continue to the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] at [[Brewster, New York]]. In 1849, the two Connecticut companies merged to form the '''Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad''', with a modified charter to continue past Brewster to [[Fishkill, New York]] on the [[Hudson River]], and in 1851 the Rhode Island company was merged into it. Later that year the first section opened, from Hartford east to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]. Extensions opened east to Providence in 1854 and west to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] in 1855. The HP&F went [[bankrupt]] on January 1, 1858, and was run by the [[trustee]]s until 1863, when it was leased by the newly formed Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad.\n\n===Southwest from Boston: 1847-1867===\n[[File:1867 New Haven, Middletown and Boston Railroad map.jpg|thumb|1867 New Haven, Middletown and Boston Railroad map]]\nAt the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] end, the earliest predecessor was the '''Norfolk County Railroad''', chartered April 24, 1847. The line from the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]]'s branch at [[Dedham, Massachusetts]] southwest to [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]] opened on April 23, 1849, and an extension to the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] in [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]] opened May 16. The company went [[bankrupt]] soon after. The short [[Medway Branch Railroad]] was leased in 1851, opening December 29, 1852.\n\nOn May 1, 1849 the '''Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad''' was incorporated to extend the line west from Blackstone to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts|Southbridge]]. On its way to [[Douglas, Massachusetts|Douglas]], this railroad passed through [[Ironstone, Massachusetts|Ironstone]], where there was a factory that made Kentucky Blue Jeans, and a nearby iron forge. The '''Midland Railroad''' was incorporated May 2, 1850 to build a new entrance to Boston, merging with the existing one south of Dedham. The two companies were consolidated with the Norfolk County Railroad on December 12, 1853 to form the '''Boston and New York Central Railroad''', which had the intent of continuing southwest through [[Connecticut]] all the way to New York City. The first section of this extension was incorporated in May 1853 as the '''East Thompson Railroad''', forming the Connecticut portion of the Southbridge and Blackstone.\n\nThe extension from Blackstone southwest to [[Mechanicsville, Connecticut]] on the [[Norwich and Worcester Railroad]] was completed in 1853. In January 1855 the new main line to Boston was opened, but was closed six months later until December 1856 because of an [[injunction]] due to the danger of the numerous [[grade crossing]]s. The new line ran to a terminal at the foot of [[Summer Street (Boston)|Summer Street]] in downtown [[Boston]] via [[South Boston]]. The full line was first operated as one on June 1, 1855, but again failed quickly. On August 6 operations were restarted on only the original Dedham-Blackstone line, operated by the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]] as a branch. On March 2, 1857 the [[trustee]]s took [[repossession]], ending the operation by the B&P. The East Thompson Railroad leased the line, reopening it again in full for about a year before another failure. At that time, all but the original Dedham-Blackstone line and Medway Branch were closed until 1867. The closed lines were sold in November 1858 to the Midland Railroad, but were not operated due to bad condition. The '''Midland Land Damage Company''' tried again in 1862, changing its name to the '''Southern Midland Railroad''' in 1863 without success.\n\n===Combined routes from Providence and Boston: 1863-1898===\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg139 NEW-YORK & NEW ENGLAND RAIROAD, THE WHITE TRAIN BETWEEN NEW-YORK AND BOSTON.jpg|thumb|New York and New England Railroad's ''White Train'' between New York and Boston, c. 1890]]\nIn May 1863, the '''Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad''' was chartered to take over operations of the failed lines and continue the line west to [[Fishkill, New York]], with a [[car float]] from there to the [[Erie Railroad]] at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. It quickly leased the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad from its [[trustee]]s, giving it a line from [[Providence (RI)|Providence]] west to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]]. In September of that year it acquired the former Boston and New York Central Railroad, but did not operate it yet; the old Norfolk County Railroad continued operations by its [[trustee]]s.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[New York and Boston Railroad (Massachusetts)|New York and Boston Railroad]] had built a line from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] (outside [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]) southwest to [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]], crossing the Norfolk County Railroad in [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]]. On January 4, 1865 the BH&E absorbed that company, making its Woonsocket Division. On December 13 of the same year, various [[Erie Railway]] men were elected to the BH&E board, placing it under partial control of the Erie.\n\nOn February 11, 1867 the BH&E leased the Norfolk County Railroad, finally reopening the full line from [[Mechanicsville, Connecticut|Mechanicsville]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. That same year, the branch to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts|Southbridge]] (part of the original Southbridge and Blackstone charter) opened. The [[Norwich and Worcester Railroad]] was leased in 1869, finally giving it a route to Boston, using the N&W from the Providence line at [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]] north to the old Norfolk County Railroad at Mechanicsville. In August 1872 a direct connection from [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]] on the line to Providence northeast to Mechanicsville opened, completing the direct line to Boston. The Willimantic stop also afforded a transfer to the [[New London Northern Railroad]] for [[Palmer, Massachusetts]] and [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] to the north, and for [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] to the south.\n\nBy 1869 the BH&E leased the [[Dutchess and Columbia Railroad]], which was building a line roughly southwest-northeast in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. The BH&E planned to build west to the D&C at the future [[Hopewell Junction, New York|Hopewell Junction]], but was not able to complete the line and lost the lease in 1870.\n\nOn September 9, 1872 the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s ''[[Boston Express]]'' began operations, using the BH&E from [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] (at the south end of the N&W) to Boston. This was later replaced around 1891 with the ''[[Long Island and Eastern States Express]]'', using the [[Danbury and Norwalk Railroad]] from [[Wilson Point, Connecticut|Wilson Point]] to the BH&E (then the NY&NE) at [[Hawleyville, Connecticut|Hawleyville]] (east of [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]).\n\nThe [[New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad]] was leased in 1873, giving a line to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Later that year, the BH&E went bankrupt and was reorganized April 17 as the '''New York and New England Railroad'''; the N&W lease was kept but the NHM&W lease was forfeited (prior to its opening August 12), becoming part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] system in 1879.\n\nNote: Various sources note the Boston Hartford & Erie as failing and falling into receivership in 1870, yet it was during the [[Panic of 1873]] that 89 of the country's 364 railroads went bankrupt.  The New York and New England Railroad Company was chartered by special act of the Massachusetts legislature on April 17, 1873.  Such was the mess of the Boston Hartford & Erie's mortgages and land titles that the NY&NE did not enter into possession of any of the BH&E \"system\" until sometime in 1875. [[Alvin F. Harlow]] in ''Steelways of New England'' states that the NY&NE did not get possession of the Hartford Providence & Fishkill line until 1877.\n\nThrough its entire existence (1873\u20131895) the NY&NE was always bedeviled by uncertainty in its land titles.  Symptomatic of this: the $20 million common stock of the NY&NE originated as the $20,000,000 principal amount of the \"Berdell Bonds\"; the chartering legislation said the NY&NE was to \"succeed to the rights of the Berdell Bondholders\".  There was a 10% assessment levied on the Berdell Bondholders as part of the chartering legislation, which also appropriated the necessary monies for the state to pay its assessment on its $3 million of Berdell Bonds.  For some reason $1,000 of Berdell bonds were never issued so for years the NY&NE had $19.999 million of common stock outstanding.\n\nThrough all this the receivers of the BH&E and the later management of the NY&NE continued to hold on to the BH&E's Norwich & Worcester lease which was a major part, if not the principal prop to the entire system's existence.  The N&W and its related Norwich Line steamers (passenger and freight) made money, enough that the NY&NE could afford to pay 8% (reduced from 10% by negotiation ca. 1885) on the N&W's capital stock.\n\nIn 1881 the extension from [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] west to [[Hopewell Junction]] on the [[Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad]] opened. Along with [[trackage rights]] over the ND&C southwest to [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], and a short line built by the NY&NE to the [[Hudson River]] at Beacon, this completed the main lines from Boston and Providence to the Hudson River, where a [[train ferry]] took cars to the [[New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad]]'s [[Newburg Branch]] at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. Part of the line in New York was built along the never-used grade from the failed [[Putnam and Dutchess Railroad]].\n\nAlso in 1881 the [[New York, Westchester and Putnam Railway]] was completed, running north and east from New York City to the NY&NE at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]]. This company had been previously involved with the BH&E in building a through line between New York and Boston, even being called the [[New York and Boston Railroad (New York)|New York and Boston Railroad]] at first, and with its opening such a through line was formed. For some time such a traffic arrangement was made, lasting through the NYW&P's absorption into the [[New York Central Railroad]] in 1894.\n\n[[File:Poughkeepsie Bridge 115997.jpg|thumb|[[Poughkeepsie Bridge]]]]\nThe [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] opened in 1888, providing a fixed crossing of the [[Hudson River]] at [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], north of the NY&NE car float at Beacon. The [[Central New England and Western Railroad]], which owned the bridge, chartered the [[Dutchess County Railroad]] in 1890 and completed it in 1892, providing a branch from the bridge to the NY&NE at [[Hopewell Junction, New York|Hopewell Junction]].\n\nThere was a December 31, 1883/January 1, 1884 receivership that got referred to at the time as the \"Midnight Receivership\" which featured the NY&NE officers trying to find a federal judge to issue a receivership order before the end of the year.  This receivership was over by 1886.\n\nCyrus W. Field had become a major figure behind the NY&NE by 1886 but after the state of Massachusetts refused to sell him the $3 million in stock it held (instead disposing of the shares to a rival group because of concern about Field's close association with Jay Gould) Field sold his holdings in the NY&NE.  The Massachusetts sale of NY&NE stock was part of a deliberate policy on the part of Massachusetts to get out of owning railroads; the sale of the Hoosac Tunnel line to the Fitchburg in 1887 was also done under this policy, a declared policy of [[John Albion Andrew|Massachusetts Governor Andrew]].\n\n[[File:Bostwick, Jabez.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jabez A. Bostwick]]]]\nThe new NY&NE President in 1887 was [[Jabez A. Bostwick]], a Standard Oil partner of John D. Rockefeller.  Rockefeller's brother William sat on the board of the New Haven.  With Rockefeller lieutenants in both camps one wonders whether the NY&NE-NYNH&H \"rivalry\" may have been a Standard Oil \"Divide & Conquer\" policy to get low rates and other benefits out of both roads who together controlled nearly all rail business in New England south of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] (running through Massachusetts from Boston to Worcester, to Springfield, Pittsfield and on to [[Albany, New York]]).\n\nThe final bankruptcy of the NY&NE happened on December 27, 1893 and the company was reorganized on August 26, 1895 as the '''New England Railroad'''; Stuart Daggett in Railroad Reorganization states the 1895 NY&NE reorganization featured a hefty 20% assessment on NY&NE common. The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] leased the company for 99 years from July 1, 1898 at 3% on the preferred (normal dividend) and common stock.  The New England Railroad was merged into the New Haven in 1908.\n\nMany sources state that most of the NE stock had early on been acquired by the New Haven, probably bought in 1895 when NY&NE stockholders who did not want to forfeit their shares for non-assessment dumped their shares on the market.  Baker in Formation of the New England Rail Systems claims there was a mini-Northern Pacific type corner in 1894 in NY&NE common when parties \"Friendly\" to the Boston & Albany tried to buy controlling influence in the NY&NE and the New Haven had to buy a large position in NY&NE common.  Both parties apparently wound up together buying more NY&NE common than actually existed; worse, the New Haven had had to pay high prices for near worthless shares.\n\nThe most well-known and prestigious train of the New York & New England Railroad was the [http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201890%20to%201899/2/lg/sci4111891.htm New England Limited of 1891], a crack Boston - New York passenger train. In 1891, the Pullman Palace Car Company refitted the train with luxurious new cars decorated in white and gold, inspiring the advertising department to call it the White Train and folks along the line to call it the Ghost Train as it sped through their towns after dark. It caught the romantic imagination of New Englanders and even after it was long gone, [[Lucius Beebe]], a Bostonian and noted railroad writer, felt compelled to memorialize it.<ref>Beebe, Lucius. \"Two Trains to Remember: The New England Limited and the Air Line Limited.\" (1965, Privately printed).</ref> Famed author [[Rudyard Kipling]] memorialized the train in a popular verse:\n\n:Without a jar, or roll, or antic,\n:Without a stop to Willimantic,\n:The ''New England Limited'' takes its way\n:At three o'clock each day,\n:Maids and Matrons, daintily dimited,\n:Ride everyday on the ''New England Limited'';\n:Rain nor snow ne'er stops its flight,\n:It makes New York at nine each night,\n:One half the glories have not been told\n:Of that wonderful train of white and gold\n:Which leaves each day for New York at three\n:Over the N.Y. & N.E.<ref name=\"morgan\">{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Bryan (ed.)|title=The Great Trains|location=New York, New York|publisher=Crown Publishers Inc.|year=1973|page=162|url=http://pages.cthome.net/mbartel/ARRhistory.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205051523/http://pages.cthome.net/mbartel/ARRhistory.htm|archivedate=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad: 1898-1969===\nMuch of the major foundation of the line of the NY & NE was the legacy of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, whose [[Main line (railway)|mainline]] ran from Providence, Rhode Island, west to Plainfield, Connecticut, to Willimantic, to Vernon, to Hartford, to Waterbury, to New Britain, to Danbury, and finally to Brewster, NY.<ref>Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Pepperell Massachusetts, 2005, pp. 83-85</ref>\n\nUntil 1955 the NY, NH & H ran passenger trains from Boston to [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]], to Putnam, joining the above line at Willimantic and continually finally to Waterbury.

In 1883 what had become a branch to Dedham was abandoned. Prior to that, a new branch just to the east had been built in 1881, and was supplemented in 1890 by a connection to the south.\n\n===Medway===\nThe [[Medway Branch Railroad]] from the main line at [[Norfolk, Massachusetts|Norfolk]] west to [[Medway, Massachusetts|Medway]] was incorporated in 1849 and opened in 1852, being immediately leased to the Norfolk County Railroad. It closed in 1864, two years after the [[New York and Boston Railroad (Massachusetts)|New York and Boston Railroad]] reached Medway.\n\n===Valley Falls===\nThe [[Rhode Island and Massachusetts Railroad]] was chartered in 1875 and opened in 1877, connecting the main Boston line at [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]] to the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] at [[Valley Falls, Rhode Island|Valley Falls]]. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1887.\n\n===Milford/Hopkinton/Ashland===\nThe [[Milford and Woonsocket Railroad]] was incorporated in 1855 and opened a line from [[Milford, Massachusetts|Milford]] to [[Bellingham, Massachusetts|Bellingham]] in 1868. It was leased by the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] until 1883.\n\nThe [[Hopkinton Railway]] was organized in 1870 and opened in 1872, running from Milford north via [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]] to the [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] at [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Ashland]]. The Providence and Worcester leased it until 1885. In 1884 the Milford and Woonsocket bought the Hopkinton, and the two ran as one.\n\nThe [[Milford, Franklin and Providence Railroad]] was organized in 1868 and opened in 1883, extending the line southeast from Milford to [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]].\n\nOn April 1, 1897 the New England Railroad leased all three companies.\n\n===Woonsocket/Pascoag===\nThe line eventually running from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] to [[Harrisville, Rhode Island]] was originally built as a competitor to the NY&NE's Boston line. The first section opened in 1852 as part of the [[Charles River Railroad]]. It reached [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] in 1863, and in 1891 the [[Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad]] opened, continuing the line to the [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] at [[Harrisville (RI)|Harrisville]]. In 1873 the NY&NE obtained the line to Woonsocket via a merger; on April 1, 1896 the New England Railroad leased the continuation past Woonsocket.\n\n===Providence and Springfield===\n[[File:Wallum Lake station 1909 postcard.jpg|thumb|Wallum Lake station on the Providence and Springfield in 1909]]\nThe [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] was chartered in 1853 and opened in 1873 from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] northwest to [[Pascoag, Rhode Island|Pascoag]].  An extension to [[Douglas Junction]] on the NY&NE main line in [[Massachusetts]] opened in 1893, and the New England Railroad leased the line on July 1, 1896.\n\n===Southbridge===\nThe [[Southbridge Branch (New England)|Southbridge Branch]] from [[East Thompson, Connecticut]] to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts]] was part of the original charter for the [[Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad]], and opened in 1867, after it had been consolidated.\n\n===Pawtuxet Valley===\nThe [[Pawtuxet Valley Railroad]] was organized in 1872 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1874, running from the main line at [[River Point, Rhode Island|River Point]] to [[Hope, Rhode Island|Hope]]. The [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]] leased it in 1884 as a continuation of their [[Pontiac Branch Railroad]].\n\n===Norwich and Worcester===\nThe '''Norwich and Worcester Railroad''' was an 1837 consolidation of the [[Boston, Norwich and New London Railroad Company]] of [[Connecticut]] and the [[Worcester and Norwich Railroad Company]] of [[Massachusetts]] when both state legislatures passed acts allowing the merger.<ref>''Railroads and Canals of the United States of America'' by Henry V.

The BH&E went bankrupt later that year, as did the NHM&W in 1875. The NHM&W became part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] in 1879.\n\n===Rockville===\nThe [[Rockville Railroad]] was incorporated in 1857 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1863. It was a short branch from the main line at [[Vernon, Connecticut|Vernon]] north and east to [[Rockville, Connecticut|Rockville]].\n\n===South Manchester===\nThe [[South Manchester Railroad]] was chartered in 1866 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1869. It was a short branch from the main line at [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]] south to [[South Manchester, Connecticut|South Manchester]].\n\n===Springfield===\nThe [[Connecticut Central Railroad]] was chartered in 1871, and its continuation in [[Massachusetts]], the [[Springfield and New London Railroad]], in 1874, to build a line from [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], with a branch to the [[Rockville Railroad]] at [[Westway, Connecticut|Westway]].  It opened in 1876 and was immediately leased by the [[Connecticut Valley Railroad]], which gave up the lease to the New York and New England Railroad in 1880.\n\n===Connecticut River===\nThe [[Meriden, Waterbury and Connecticut River Railroad]] was formed in 1888 as a consolidation of two smaller companies, opening in 1885 and 1888. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1892, as a branch from the main line in [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] east to [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] on the [[Connecticut River]]. The company went bankrupt and was reorganized in 1898 as the [[Middletown, Meriden and Waterbury Railroad]], and was immediately leased by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]].\n\n==Station listing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!State\n!Milepost\n!City\n!Station\n!Opening date\n!Connections and notes\n|-\n|rowspan=14|[[Rhode Island|RI]]\n|\n|rowspan=3|[[Providence (RI)|Providence]]\n|[[Providence (MBTA station)|Providence]]\n|\n|[[Union Station (Providence, Rhode Island)|Union Station]] serving all railroads in Providence\n|-\n|\n|[[Dike Street (NY&NE station)|Dike Street]]\n|\n|originally Westminster Street?<br>junction with [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] (NY&NE)\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|junction with [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]]), location: Garfield Avenue and Cranston Street\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|[[Cranston (RI)|Cranston]]\n|[[West Providence (NY&NE station)|West Providence]]\n|-\n|\n|[[Cranston (NY&NE station)|Cranston]]\n|-\n|\n|[[Warwick (RI)|Warwick]]\n|[[Natick (NY&NE station)|Natick]]\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|[[West Warwick (RI)|West Warwick]]\n|[[River Point (NY&NE station)|River Point]]\n|\n|junction with [[Pawtuxet Valley Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]]) and [[Pontiac Branch Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]])\n|-\n|\n|[[West Warwick (NY&NE station)|West Warwick]]\n|\n|Presumed to serve village of  Arctic?

It operated under that name from 1873 to 1893. Prior to 1873 it was known as the '''Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad''', which had been formed by several smaller railroads dating back to 1846. After bankruptcy in 1893, the New York and New England Railroad was reorganized and became known as the '''New England Railroad''' before its 1898 lease to the competing [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]. Today, most of the original New York and New England lines have been abandoned; however a portion in Massachusetts is now part of the [[MBTA|MBTA's]] [[Franklin Line]] providing commuter rail service to [[South Station]] in [[Boston]]. The [[Connecticut Southern Railroad]] operates freight service on a small portion of the former NY&NE line near [[East Hartford]] and [[Manchester, Connecticut]]. Other portions in Connecticut and Rhode Island have been converted to [[rail trail]]s.<ref>[http://www.rigreenways.org/paths/ws-data.htm Greenways Alliance of Rhode Island]</ref>\n\nPan Am Southern operates between New Britain and Waterbury. The portion east of New Britain has been converted to a busway.\n\n==History==\n\n===West from Providence: 1846-1863===\nThe corridor from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] west into [[New York (state)|New York]] was originally chartered as three companies. The '''Providence and Plainfield Railroad''', chartered in June 1846, would run from Providence to the [[Rhode Island]]/[[Connecticut]] state line. The '''Hartford and Providence Railroad''', incorporated in May 1847, would continue west to [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the '''New York and Hartford Railroad''', chartered and incorporated in May 1845, would continue to the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] at [[Brewster, New York]]. In 1849, the two Connecticut companies merged to form the '''Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad''', with a modified charter to continue past Brewster to [[Fishkill, New York]] on the [[Hudson River]], and in 1851 the Rhode Island company was merged into it. Later that year the first section opened, from Hartford east to [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]. Extensions opened east to Providence in 1854 and west to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] in 1855. The HP&F went [[bankrupt]] on January 1, 1858, and was run by the [[trustee]]s until 1863, when it was leased by the newly formed Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad.\n\n===Southwest from Boston: 1847-1867===\n[[File:1867 New Haven, Middletown and Boston Railroad map.jpg|thumb|1867 New Haven, Middletown and Boston Railroad map]]\nAt the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] end, the earliest predecessor was the '''Norfolk County Railroad''', chartered April 24, 1847. The line from the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]]'s branch at [[Dedham, Massachusetts]] southwest to [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]] opened on April 23, 1849, and an extension to the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] in [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]] opened May 16. The company went [[bankrupt]] soon after. The short [[Medway Branch Railroad]] was leased in 1851, opening December 29, 1852.\n\nOn May 1, 1849 the '''Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad''' was incorporated to extend the line west from Blackstone to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts|Southbridge]]. On its way to [[Douglas, Massachusetts|Douglas]], this railroad passed through [[Ironstone, Massachusetts|Ironstone]], where there was a factory that made Kentucky Blue Jeans, and a nearby iron forge. The '''Midland Railroad''' was incorporated May 2, 1850 to build a new entrance to Boston, merging with the existing one south of Dedham. The two companies were consolidated with the Norfolk County Railroad on December 12, 1853 to form the '''Boston and New York Central Railroad''', which had the intent of continuing southwest through [[Connecticut]] all the way to New York City. The first section of this extension was incorporated in May 1853 as the '''East Thompson Railroad''', forming the Connecticut portion of the Southbridge and Blackstone.\n\nThe extension from Blackstone southwest to [[Mechanicsville, Connecticut]] on the [[Norwich and Worcester Railroad]] was completed in 1853. In January 1855 the new main line to Boston was opened, but was closed six months later until December 1856 because of an [[injunction]] due to the danger of the numerous [[grade crossing]]s. The new line ran to a terminal at the foot of [[Summer Street (Boston)|Summer Street]] in downtown [[Boston]] via [[South Boston]]. The full line was first operated as one on June 1, 1855, but again failed quickly. On August 6 operations were restarted on only the original Dedham-Blackstone line, operated by the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]] as a branch. On March 2, 1857 the [[trustee]]s took [[repossession]], ending the operation by the B&P. The East Thompson Railroad leased the line, reopening it again in full for about a year before another failure. At that time, all but the original Dedham-Blackstone line and Medway Branch were closed until 1867. The closed lines were sold in November 1858 to the Midland Railroad, but were not operated due to bad condition. The '''Midland Land Damage Company''' tried again in 1862, changing its name to the '''Southern Midland Railroad''' in 1863 without success.\n\n===Combined routes from Providence and Boston: 1863-1898===\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg139 NEW-YORK & NEW ENGLAND RAIROAD, THE WHITE TRAIN BETWEEN NEW-YORK AND BOSTON.jpg|thumb|New York and New England Railroad's ''White Train'' between New York and Boston, c. 1890]]\nIn May 1863, the '''Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad''' was chartered to take over operations of the failed lines and continue the line west to [[Fishkill, New York]], with a [[car float]] from there to the [[Erie Railroad]] at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. It quickly leased the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad from its [[trustee]]s, giving it a line from [[Providence (RI)|Providence]] west to [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]]. In September of that year it acquired the former Boston and New York Central Railroad, but did not operate it yet; the old Norfolk County Railroad continued operations by its [[trustee]]s.\n\nIn the meantime, the [[New York and Boston Railroad (Massachusetts)|New York and Boston Railroad]] had built a line from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] (outside [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]) southwest to [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]], crossing the Norfolk County Railroad in [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]]. On January 4, 1865 the BH&E absorbed that company, making its Woonsocket Division. On December 13 of the same year, various [[Erie Railway]] men were elected to the BH&E board, placing it under partial control of the Erie.\n\nOn February 11, 1867 the BH&E leased the Norfolk County Railroad, finally reopening the full line from [[Mechanicsville, Connecticut|Mechanicsville]] to [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. That same year, the branch to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts|Southbridge]] (part of the original Southbridge and Blackstone charter) opened. The [[Norwich and Worcester Railroad]] was leased in 1869, finally giving it a route to Boston, using the N&W from the Providence line at [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]] north to the old Norfolk County Railroad at Mechanicsville. In August 1872 a direct connection from [[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]] on the line to Providence northeast to Mechanicsville opened, completing the direct line to Boston. The Willimantic stop also afforded a transfer to the [[New London Northern Railroad]] for [[Palmer, Massachusetts]] and [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] to the north, and for [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] to the south.\n\nBy 1869 the BH&E leased the [[Dutchess and Columbia Railroad]], which was building a line roughly southwest-northeast in [[Dutchess County, New York]]. The BH&E planned to build west to the D&C at the future [[Hopewell Junction, New York|Hopewell Junction]], but was not able to complete the line and lost the lease in 1870.\n\nOn September 9, 1872 the [[Long Island Rail Road]]'s ''[[Boston Express]]'' began operations, using the BH&E from [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] (at the south end of the N&W) to Boston. This was later replaced around 1891 with the ''[[Long Island and Eastern States Express]]'', using the [[Danbury and Norwalk Railroad]] from [[Wilson Point, Connecticut|Wilson Point]] to the BH&E (then the NY&NE) at [[Hawleyville, Connecticut|Hawleyville]] (east of [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]]).\n\nThe [[New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad]] was leased in 1873, giving a line to [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Later that year, the BH&E went bankrupt and was reorganized April 17 as the '''New York and New England Railroad'''; the N&W lease was kept but the NHM&W lease was forfeited (prior to its opening August 12), becoming part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] system in 1879.\n\nNote: Various sources note the Boston Hartford & Erie as failing and falling into receivership in 1870, yet it was during the [[Panic of 1873]] that 89 of the country's 364 railroads went bankrupt.  The New York and New England Railroad Company was chartered by special act of the Massachusetts legislature on April 17, 1873.  Such was the mess of the Boston Hartford & Erie's mortgages and land titles that the NY&NE did not enter into possession of any of the BH&E \"system\" until sometime in 1875.  Alvin F. Harlow in ''Steelways of New England'' states that the NY&NE did not get possession of the Hartford Providence & Fishkill line until 1877.\n\nThrough its entire existence (1873\u20131895) the NY&NE was always bedeviled by uncertainty in its land titles.  Symptomatic of this: the $20 million common stock of the NY&NE originated as the $20,000,000 principal amount of the \"Berdell Bonds\"; the chartering legislation said the NY&NE was to \"succeed to the rights of the Berdell Bondholders\".  There was a 10% assessment levied on the Berdell Bondholders as part of the chartering legislation, which also appropriated the necessary monies for the state to pay its assessment on its $3 million of Berdell Bonds.  For some reason $1,000 of Berdell bonds were never issued so for years the NY&NE had $19.999 million of common stock outstanding.\n\nThrough all this the receivers of the BH&E and the later management of the NY&NE continued to hold on to the BH&E's Norwich & Worcester lease which was a major part, if not the principal prop to the entire system's existence.  The N&W and its related Norwich Line steamers (passenger and freight) made money, enough that the NY&NE could afford to pay 8% (reduced from 10% by negotiation ca. 1885) on the N&W's capital stock.\n\nIn 1881 the extension from [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] west to [[Hopewell Junction]] on the [[Newburgh, Dutchess and Connecticut Railroad]] opened. Along with [[trackage rights]] over the ND&C southwest to [[Beacon, New York|Beacon]], and a short line built by the NY&NE to the [[Hudson River]] at Beacon, this completed the main lines from Boston and Providence to the Hudson River, where a [[train ferry]] took cars to the [[New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad]]'s [[Newburg Branch]] at [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]]. Part of the line in New York was built along the never-used grade from the failed [[Putnam and Dutchess Railroad]].\n\nAlso in 1881 the [[New York, Westchester and Putnam Railway]] was completed, running north and east from New York City to the NY&NE at [[Brewster, New York|Brewster]]. This company had been previously involved with the BH&E in building a through line between New York and Boston, even being called the [[New York and Boston Railroad (New York)|New York and Boston Railroad]] at first, and with its opening such a through line was formed. For some time such a traffic arrangement was made, lasting through the NYW&P's absorption into the [[New York Central Railroad]] in 1894.\n\n[[File:Poughkeepsie Bridge 115997.jpg|thumb|[[Poughkeepsie Bridge]]]]\nThe [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] opened in 1888, providing a fixed crossing of the [[Hudson River]] at [[Poughkeepsie (city), New York|Poughkeepsie]], north of the NY&NE car float at Beacon. The [[Central New England and Western Railroad]], which owned the bridge, chartered the [[Dutchess County Railroad]] in 1890 and completed it in 1892, providing a branch from the bridge to the NY&NE at [[Hopewell Junction, New York|Hopewell Junction]].\n\nThere was a December 31, 1883/January 1, 1884 receivership that got referred to at the time as the \"Midnight Receivership\" which featured the NY&NE officers trying to find a federal judge to issue a receivership order before the end of the year.  This receivership was over by 1886.\n\nCyrus W. Field had become a major figure behind the NY&NE by 1886 but after the state of Massachusetts refused to sell him the $3 million in stock it held (instead disposing of the shares to a rival group because of concern about Field's close association with Jay Gould) Field sold his holdings in the NY&NE.  The Massachusetts sale of NY&NE stock was part of a deliberate policy on the part of Massachusetts to get out of owning railroads; the sale of the Hoosac Tunnel line to the Fitchburg in 1887 was also done under this policy, a declared policy of [[John Albion Andrew|Massachusetts Governor Andrew]].\n\n[[File:Bostwick, Jabez.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jabez A. Bostwick]]]]\nThe new NY&NE President in 1887 was [[Jabez A. Bostwick]], a Standard Oil partner of John D. Rockefeller.  Rockefeller's brother William sat on the board of the New Haven.  With Rockefeller lieutenants in both camps one wonders whether the NY&NE-NYNH&H \"rivalry\" may have been a Standard Oil \"Divide & Conquer\" policy to get low rates and other benefits out of both roads who together controlled nearly all rail business in New England south of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] (running through Massachusetts from Boston to Worcester, to Springfield, Pittsfield and on to [[Albany, New York]]).\n\nThe final bankruptcy of the NY&NE happened on December 27, 1893 and the company was reorganized on August 26, 1895 as the '''New England Railroad'''; Stuart Daggett in Railroad Reorganization states the 1895 NY&NE reorganization featured a hefty 20% assessment on NY&NE common. The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] leased the company for 99 years from July 1, 1898 at 3% on the preferred (normal dividend) and common stock.  The New England Railroad was merged into the New Haven in 1908.\n\nMany sources state that most of the NE stock had early on been acquired by the New Haven, probably bought in 1895 when NY&NE stockholders who did not want to forfeit their shares for non-assessment dumped their shares on the market.  Baker in Formation of the New England Rail Systems claims there was a mini-Northern Pacific type corner in 1894 in NY&NE common when parties \"Friendly\" to the Boston & Albany tried to buy controlling influence in the NY&NE and the New Haven had to buy a large position in NY&NE common.  Both parties apparently wound up together buying more NY&NE common than actually existed; worse, the New Haven had had to pay high prices for near worthless shares.\n\nThe most well-known and prestigious train of the New York & New England Railroad was the [http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201890%20to%201899/2/lg/sci4111891.htm New England Limited of 1891], a crack Boston - New York passenger train. In 1891, the Pullman Palace Car Company refitted the train with luxurious new cars decorated in white and gold, inspiring the advertising department to call it the White Train and folks along the line to call it the Ghost Train as it sped through their towns after dark. It caught the romantic imagination of New Englanders and even after it was long gone, [[Lucius Beebe]], a Bostonian and noted railroad writer, felt compelled to memorialize it.<ref>Beebe, Lucius. \"Two Trains to Remember: The New England Limited and the Air Line Limited.\" (1965, Privately printed).</ref> Famed author [[Rudyard Kipling]] memorialized the train in a popular verse:\n\n:Without a jar, or roll, or antic,\n:Without a stop to Willimantic,\n:The ''New England Limited'' takes its way\n:At three o'clock each day,\n:Maids and Matrons, daintily dimited,\n:Ride everyday on the ''New England Limited'';\n:Rain nor snow ne'er stops its flight,\n:It makes New York at nine each night,\n:One half the glories have not been told\n:Of that wonderful train of white and gold\n:Which leaves each day for New York at three\n:Over the N.Y. & N.E.<ref name=\"morgan\">{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Bryan (ed.)|title=The Great Trains|location=New York, New York|publisher=Crown Publishers Inc.|year=1973|page=162|url=http://pages.cthome.net/mbartel/ARRhistory.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205051523/http://pages.cthome.net/mbartel/ARRhistory.htm|archivedate=2010-12-05}}</ref>\n\n===New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad: 1898-1969===\nMuch of the major foundation of the line of the NY & NE was the legacy of the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad, whose [[Main line (railway)|mainline]] ran from Providence, Rhode Island, west to Plainfield, Connecticut, to Willimantic, to Vernon, to Hartford, to Waterbury, to New Britain, to Danbury, and finally to Brewster, NY.<ref>Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Pepperell Massachusetts, 2005, pp. 83-85</ref>\n\nUntil 1955 the NY, NH & H ran passenger trains from Boston to [[Blackstone, Massachusetts|Blackstone]], to Putnam, joining the above line at Willimantic and continually finally to Waterbury.

In 1883 what had become a branch to Dedham was abandoned. Prior to that, a new branch just to the east had been built in 1881, and was supplemented in 1890 by a connection to the south.\n\n===Medway===\nThe [[Medway Branch Railroad]] from the main line at [[Norfolk, Massachusetts|Norfolk]] west to [[Medway, Massachusetts|Medway]] was incorporated in 1849 and opened in 1852, being immediately leased to the Norfolk County Railroad. It closed in 1864, two years after the [[New York and Boston Railroad (Massachusetts)|New York and Boston Railroad]] reached Medway.\n\n===Valley Falls===\nThe [[Rhode Island and Massachusetts Railroad]] was chartered in 1875 and opened in 1877, connecting the main Boston line at [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]] to the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] at [[Valley Falls, Rhode Island|Valley Falls]]. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1887.\n\n===Milford/Hopkinton/Ashland===\nThe [[Milford and Woonsocket Railroad]] was incorporated in 1855 and opened a line from [[Milford, Massachusetts|Milford]] to [[Bellingham, Massachusetts|Bellingham]] in 1868. It was leased by the [[Providence and Worcester Railroad]] until 1883.\n\nThe [[Hopkinton Railway]] was organized in 1870 and opened in 1872, running from Milford north via [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]] to the [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] at [[Ashland, Massachusetts|Ashland]]. The Providence and Worcester leased it until 1885. In 1884 the Milford and Woonsocket bought the Hopkinton, and the two ran as one.\n\nThe [[Milford, Franklin and Providence Railroad]] was organized in 1868 and opened in 1883, extending the line southeast from Milford to [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]].\n\nOn April 1, 1897 the New England Railroad leased all three companies.\n\n===Woonsocket/Pascoag===\nThe line eventually running from [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] to [[Harrisville, Rhode Island]] was originally built as a competitor to the NY&NE's Boston line. The first section opened in 1852 as part of the [[Charles River Railroad]]. It reached [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]] in 1863, and in 1891 the [[Woonsocket and Pascoag Railroad]] opened, continuing the line to the [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] at [[Harrisville (RI)|Harrisville]]. In 1873 the NY&NE obtained the line to Woonsocket via a merger; on April 1, 1896 the New England Railroad leased the continuation past Woonsocket.\n\n===Providence and Springfield===\n[[File:Wallum Lake station 1909 postcard.jpg|thumb|Wallum Lake station on the Providence and Springfield in 1909]]\nThe [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] was chartered in 1853 and opened in 1873 from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] northwest to [[Pascoag, Rhode Island|Pascoag]].  An extension to [[Douglas Junction]] on the NY&NE main line in [[Massachusetts]] opened in 1893, and the New England Railroad leased the line on July 1, 1896.\n\n===Southbridge===\nThe [[Southbridge Branch (New England)|Southbridge Branch]] from [[East Thompson, Connecticut]] to [[Southbridge, Massachusetts]] was part of the original charter for the [[Southbridge and Blackstone Railroad]], and opened in 1867, after it had been consolidated.\n\n===Pawtuxet Valley===\nThe [[Pawtuxet Valley Railroad]] was organized in 1872 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1874, running from the main line at [[River Point, Rhode Island|River Point]] to [[Hope, Rhode Island|Hope]]. The [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]] leased it in 1884 as a continuation of their [[Pontiac Branch Railroad]].\n\n===Norwich and Worcester===\nThe '''Norwich and Worcester Railroad''' was an 1837 consolidation of the [[Boston, Norwich and New London Railroad Company]] of [[Connecticut]] and the [[Worcester and Norwich Railroad Company]] of [[Massachusetts]] when both state legislatures passed acts allowing the merger.<ref>''Railroads and Canals of the United States of America'' by Henry V.

Schultz & Co, 1860), page 213  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=M0YKAAAAIAAJ]</ref> Neither of these companies had built any railroad but the new one proceeded to build one from [[Norwich, Connecticut]] (later [[New London, Connecticut|New London]]) north to [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], including the [[Taft Tunnel]] at Lisbon, CT. The '''Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad''' leased it in 1869, and the lease continued through the reorganizations. Connections were provided with the Providence line at [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]] and the Boston line between [[Putnam, Connecticut|Putnam]] and [[Mechanicsville, Connecticut|Mechanicsville]]. In 1886 the New England Railroad company renewed the lease.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3voWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173 AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NORWICH & WORCESTER RAILROAD COMPANY AND THE NEW ENGLAND RAILROAD COMPANY] IN REGARD TO THE LEASE OF THE NORWICH AND WORCESTER RAILROAD TO THE BOSTON HARTFORD AND ERIE RAILROAD COMPANY, page 173.</ref> that it acquired from the Boston, Hartford, and Erie.\n\nUntil 1955 the line served as the basis for Boston-bypassing run-through train, the ''[[East Wind (train)|East Wind]]'' from New York to [[Bangor, Maine]], via the Norwich and Worcester line.<ref>http://faracresfarm.com/jbvb/rr/run_thru.html</ref><ref>Ronald Dale Karr, 'The Rail Lines of Southern New England,' Pepperell Massachusetts, 2005, pp. 105-108</ref><ref>New York, New Haven Railroad timetable, April 24, 1955, Table 7 http://streamlinermemories.info/Eastern/NH55TT.pdf</ref>\n\n===New Haven===\nThe [[New Haven, Middletown and Willimantic Railroad]] opened and was leased to the Boston, Hartford and Erie Railroad in 1873. The BH&E went bankrupt later that year, as did the NHM&W in 1875. The NHM&W became part of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] in 1879.\n\n===Rockville===\nThe [[Rockville Railroad]] was incorporated in 1857 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1863. It was a short branch from the main line at [[Vernon, Connecticut|Vernon]] north and east to [[Rockville, Connecticut|Rockville]].\n\n===South Manchester===\nThe [[South Manchester Railroad]] was chartered in 1866 and opened and leased to the Hartford, Providence and Fishkill Railroad in 1869. It was a short branch from the main line at [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]] south to [[South Manchester, Connecticut|South Manchester]].\n\n===Springfield===\nThe [[Connecticut Central Railroad]] was chartered in 1871, and its continuation in [[Massachusetts]], the [[Springfield and New London Railroad]], in 1874, to build a line from [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford]] to [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], with a branch to the [[Rockville Railroad]] at [[Westway, Connecticut|Westway]].  It opened in 1876 and was immediately leased by the [[Connecticut Valley Railroad]], which gave up the lease to the New York and New England Railroad in 1880.\n\n===Connecticut River===\nThe [[Meriden, Waterbury and Connecticut River Railroad]] was formed in 1888 as a consolidation of two smaller companies, opening in 1885 and 1888. The New York and New England Railroad leased it in 1892, as a branch from the main line in [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] east to [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] on the [[Connecticut River]]. The company went bankrupt and was reorganized in 1898 as the [[Middletown, Meriden and Waterbury Railroad]], and was immediately leased by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]].\n\n==Station listing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!State\n!Milepost\n!City\n!Station\n!Opening date\n!Connections and notes\n|-\n|rowspan=14|[[Rhode Island|RI]]\n|\n|rowspan=3|[[Providence (RI)|Providence]]\n|[[Providence (MBTA station)|Providence]]\n|\n|[[Union Station (Providence, Rhode Island)|Union Station]] serving all railroads in Providence\n|-\n|\n|[[Dike Street (NY&NE station)|Dike Street]]\n|\n|originally Westminster Street?<br>junction with [[Providence and Springfield Railroad]] (NY&NE)\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|junction with [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]]), location: Garfield Avenue and Cranston Street\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|[[Cranston (RI)|Cranston]]\n|[[West Providence (NY&NE station)|West Providence]]\n|-\n|\n|[[Cranston (NY&NE station)|Cranston]]\n|-\n|\n|[[Warwick (RI)|Warwick]]\n|[[Natick (NY&NE station)|Natick]]\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=2|[[West Warwick (RI)|West Warwick]]\n|[[River Point (NY&NE station)|River Point]]\n|\n|junction with [[Pawtuxet Valley Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]]) and [[Pontiac Branch Railroad]] ([[NYNH&H]])\n|-\n|\n|[[West Warwick (NY&NE station)|West Warwick]]\n|\n|Presumed to serve village of  Arctic?
