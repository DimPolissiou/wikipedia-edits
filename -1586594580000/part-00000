During the 12th century, the decline of the administrative system of appointed provincial governors gave way to warrior bands as the true holders of local authority. The Shimazu clan (who were based in modern [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] Prefecture) gained control of Hyuga and therefore Miyazaki. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded the Kyushu region in 1587 and subsequently drove the Shimazu back to their base. Miyazaki was reworked into the new political sphere of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Shogunate]]. During the Tokugawa era, Miyazaki became a castle town, the hub of a feudal domain, and a trade stop within the nationwide commercial network. Miyazaki also became more closely connected to Kyoto during this period.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=592-594|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Hyuga Province was renamed to Miyazaki Prefecture with Miyazaki being its capital.

During the 12th century, the decline of the administrative system of appointed provincial governors gave way to warrior bands as the true holders of local authority. The Shimazu clan (who were based in modern [[Kagoshima Prefecture|Kagoshima]] Prefecture) gained control of Hyuga and therefore Miyazaki. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded the Kyushu region in 1587 and subsequently drove the Shimazu back to their base. Miyazaki was reworked into the new political sphere of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Shogunate]]. During the Tokugawa era, Miyazaki became a castle town, the hub of a feudal domain, and a trade stop within the nationwide commercial network. Miyazaki also became more closely connected to Kyoto during this period.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=592-594|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Hyuga Province was renamed to Miyazaki Prefecture with Miyazaki being its capital.

Before young Prince Hamlet departure's to University, Ophelia makes a small interference to his farewell party, which surprises Queen Gertrude (Watts), who later includes Ophelia as one of her ladies-in-waiting. \n\nSeveral years later, Prince Hamlet (MacKay) returns to the kingdom after finishing his education, while Claudius starts a secret affair with Queen Gertrude. As she is approaching old age with inept sadness, Gertrude sends Ophelia (Ridley) to see a witch named Matilda (Watts) and hands her a potion to get her youth again and desires 2 ounces of the witch's tonic. After a heated argument between King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude, The King is murdered. With the kingdom in need of a King, Claudius steps in and marries The Queen. Hamlet bends the knee to Claudius, but is not happy about the sudden turn of events.\n\nAt the same time, Ophelia captures the affections of Hamlet, and they start a relationship. Later, Hamlet confesses his love for Ophelia and they secretly marry and have sex. Hamlet vows to avenge his father's death and that they will leave that place. The kingdom is on the brink of war amidst its own political intrigue and betrayal. King Claudius sets Ophelia up as a trap to see if Hamlet loves her. However, prior to this, Ophelia had found poison in Claudius' coat, and she confesses this all to Hamlet while Claudius watches from afar. Ophelia tells Hamlet that they are being watched, so they pretend to have nothing to do with each other; Hamlet walks away mad. Hamlet puts on a play that upsets King Claudius. Hamlet draws his sword on the king, and the King declares treason. Ophelia's father is killed.\n\nKing Claudius learns about Hamlet marrying Ophelia and he confronts her and she accuses him of accusing his lover of being a witch and having her killed; along with his only son. The King is enraged and has Ophelia locked in the dungeon. She escapes and acts like she has turned mad, so the queen has mercy upon her. Soldiers and the Queen run after Ophelia, who takes drops of a sleeping drug from the witch to act dead. In her mad performance in front of the court she had instructed Horatio to dig her up once she is buried. He does and she flees. The kingdom thinks she is dead; as the witch had done years before. Ophelia returns to the witch and discovers the witch had helped King Claudius kill King Hamlet; she has a undying love for him and can not deny him what he wants. The Queen sees that Ophelia is alive and cuts her hair; since she is already dead. Ophelia sneaks in to speak with Hamlet before he fights her brother Laertes (Felton) over the death of her father. They both say their goodbyes as Ophelia escapes in a rowing boat while Hamlet faces Laertes. A lengthy battle ensues, and Hamlet and Laertes both die from exhaustion and from the witch's poison. The Queen goes to her son's lifeless body and, out of anger, takes his sword and pushes it into King Claudius's heart, killing him. The Queen later takes the poison and dies as the witch gently holds her body and is saddened. The kingdom is attacked and the members of the court are killed.\n\nOphelia, pregnant with Hamlet's child, runs in exile. Ophelia finally makes it to the nunnery that Hamlet had told her to escape to. She gives birth and raises her daughter in love and peace. She learns to not attempt vengeance and to carry on with her life. The film ends with Ophelia playing in the open fields with her daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Daisy Ridley]] as [[Ophelia]]\n** Mia Quiney as Young Ophelia\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] / [[Mechthild of Magdeburg|Mechtild]]\n** [[Anna Rust]] as Young Mechtild\n* [[Clive Owen]] as [[King Claudius|Claudius]]\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]\n** Jack Cunningham-Nuttall as Young Hamlet\n* [[Tom Felton]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]]\n* [[Devon Terrell]] as [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]]\n* [[Dominic Mafham]] as [[Polonius]]\n* [[Daisy Head]] as Christina\n\n== Production ==\nOn May 4, 2016, it was announced that [[Daisy Ridley]] and [[Naomi Watts]] would star in the drama film ''Ophelia'' based on the character [[Ophelia|of same name]] by [[William Shakespeare]], the film would be based on the novel by [[Lisa Klein]] which [[Claire McCarthy]] would direct based on the script by [[Semi Chellas]].<ref name=\"May2016D\">{{cite news|last1=Jaafar|first1=Ali|title=Daisy Ridley & Naomi Watts In Final Talks To Star In \u2018Ophelia\u2019; Covert Media Aboard New Take On \u2018Hamlet\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/daisy-ridley-naomi-watts-ophelia-movie-hamlet-covert-media-1201748886/|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=Deadline|date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Covert Media would finance the film, while Daniel Bobker and [[Ehren Kruger]] would produce the film along with Sarah Curtis.<ref name=\"May2016D\" />  Bert Marcus is also executive producing the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5690810/|title=Ophelia|date=22 January 2018|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nFilming began in April 2017, with a first look image released in May.<ref name=\"May2017CS\">{{cite news|title=Daisy Ridley Photo from Ophelia - ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/850909-first-daisy-ridley-photo-from-ophelia#/slide/1|accessdate=May 23, 2017|work=ComingSoon.net|date=May 22, 2017}}</ref> After three months, principal production wrapped on July 6, 2017.

Hamlet draws his sword on the king, and the King declares treason. Ophelia's father is killed.\n\nKing Claudius learns about Hamlet marrying Ophelia and he confronts her and she accuses him of accusing his lover of being a witch and having her killed; along with his only son. The King is enraged and has Ophelia locked in the dungeon. She escapes and acts like she has turned mad, so the queen has mercy upon her. Soldiers and the Queen run after Ophelia, who takes drops of a sleeping drug from the witch to act dead. In her mad performance in front of the court she had instructed Horatio to dig her up once she is buried. He does and she flees. The kingdom thinks she is dead; as the witch had done years before. Ophelia returns to the witch and discovers the witch had helped King Claudius kill King Hamlet; she has a undying love for him and can not deny him what he wants. The Queen sees that Ophelia is alive and cuts her hair; since she is already dead. Ophelia sneaks in to speak with Hamlet before he fights her brother Laertes (Felton) over the death of her father. They both say their goodbyes as Ophelia escapes in a rowing boat while Hamlet faces Laertes. A lengthy battle ensues, and Hamlet and Laertes both die from exhaustion and from the witch's poison. The Queen goes to her son's lifeless body and, out of anger, takes his sword and pushes it into King Claudius's heart, killing him. The Queen later takes the poison and dies as the witch gently holds her body and is saddened. The kingdom is attacked and the members of the court are killed.\n\nOphelia, pregnant with Hamlet's child, runs in exile. Ophelia finally makes it to the nunnery that Hamlet had told her to escape to. She gives birth and raises her daughter in love and peace. She learns to not attempt vengeance and to carry on with her life. The film ends with Ophelia playing in the open fields with her daughter.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Daisy Ridley]] as [[Ophelia]]\n** Mia Quiney as Young Ophelia\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]] / [[Mechthild of Magdeburg|Mechtild]]\n** [[Anna Rust]] as Young Mechtild\n* [[Clive Owen]] as [[King Claudius|Claudius]]\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]]\n** Jack Cunningham-Nuttall as Young Hamlet\n* [[Tom Felton]] as [[Laertes (Hamlet)|Laertes]]\n* [[Devon Terrell]] as [[Horatio (Hamlet)|Horatio]]\n* [[Dominic Mafham]] as [[Polonius]]\n* [[Daisy Head]] as Christina\n\n== Production ==\nOn May 4, 2016, it was announced that [[Daisy Ridley]] and [[Naomi Watts]] would star in the drama film ''Ophelia'' based on the character [[Ophelia|of same name]] by [[William Shakespeare]], the film would be based on the novel by [[Lisa Klein]] which [[Claire McCarthy]] would direct based on the script by [[Semi Chellas]].<ref name=\"May2016D\">{{cite news|last1=Jaafar|first1=Ali|title=Daisy Ridley & Naomi Watts In Final Talks To Star In \u2018Ophelia\u2019; Covert Media Aboard New Take On \u2018Hamlet\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/daisy-ridley-naomi-watts-ophelia-movie-hamlet-covert-media-1201748886/|accessdate=May 6, 2016|work=Deadline|date=May 4, 2016}}</ref> Covert Media would finance the film, while Daniel Bobker and [[Ehren Kruger]] would produce the film along with Sarah Curtis.<ref name=\"May2016D\" />  Bert Marcus is also executive producing the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5690810/|title=Ophelia|date=22 January 2018|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nFilming began in April 2017, with a first look image released in May.<ref name=\"May2017CS\">{{cite news|title=Daisy Ridley Photo from Ophelia - ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/850909-first-daisy-ridley-photo-from-ophelia#/slide/1|accessdate=May 23, 2017|work=ComingSoon.net|date=May 22, 2017}}</ref> After three months, principal production wrapped on July 6, 2017.

Some have suggested that he was born in 1579 because he was admitted to the [[London Charterhouse]] in 1629, a prerequisite to which was being at least 50 years old, though there is no certainty over this. He had made his living as a professional soldier, serving as an officer with the [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Russia]]n armies.<ref>Michael Morrow, Colette Harris, and Frank Traficante, \"Hume, Tobias\", ''Grove Music Online'', edited by Deane Root. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press (accessed April 22, 2015),</ref>\n\nHis published music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the [[lyra viol]]) and [[song]]s. They were gathered in two collections, ''[[The First Part of Ayres]]'' (or ''Musicall Humors'', 1605) and ''Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke'' (1607). He was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant [[lute]], something which caused [[John Dowland]] to publish a rebuttal of Hume's ideas.\n\nHume was also known as a prankster, as some of his somewhat unusual compositions illustrate. His most notorious piece was \"An Invention for Two to Play upone one Viole\", also known as Prince's Almayne.<ref name=\":0\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=POnaGO7Hcdg</ref> Two bows are required and the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the larger player. This work was notated in [[tablature]] and is indeed technically possible to play.<ref name=\":0\" /> His instructions to \"drum this with the backe of your bow\" in another piece, \"Harke, harke,\" from the ''First Part of Ayres'', constitute the earliest known use of ''[[col legno]]'' in Western music.<ref>Peter Walls, \"Bow\" II. Bowing, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001): \u00a72, xi.</ref>\n\nAt Christmas 1629 he entered Charterhouse as a poor brother. His mind seems to have given way, for in July 1642 he published a rambling ''True Petition of Colonel Hume'' to parliament offering either to defeat the rebels in Ireland with a hundred 'instruments of war,' or, if furnished with a complete navy, to bring the king within three months twenty millions of money. He styles himself 'colonel,' but the rank was probably of his own invention, for in the entry of his death, which took place at Charterhouse on Wednesday, 16 April 1645, he is still called Captain Hume.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nTobias Hume is the main character of the novel ''Loot and Loyalty'' written by [[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]]<ref \n name=\" :\u00d8\">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.149694/page/n7/mode/2up</ref> \n\n{{listen|filename=Captaine Tobias Hume - Tobacco, No.3 The First Part of Ayres - The Musicall Humours1605.ogg|title=Tobacco, No.3 from the First Part of Ayres or the Musicall Humours (1605)|description=Performed by Phillip W.

Some have suggested that he was born in 1579 because he was admitted to the [[London Charterhouse]] in 1629, a prerequisite to which was being at least 50 years old, though there is no certainty over this. He had made his living as a professional soldier, serving as an officer with the [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Russia]]n armies.<ref>Michael Morrow, Colette Harris, and Frank Traficante, \"Hume, Tobias\", ''Grove Music Online'', edited by Deane Root. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press (accessed April 22, 2015),</ref>\n\nHis published music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the [[lyra viol]]) and [[song]]s. They were gathered in two collections, ''[[The First Part of Ayres]]'' (or ''Musicall Humors'', 1605) and ''Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke'' (1607). He was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant [[lute]], something which caused [[John Dowland]] to publish a rebuttal of Hume's ideas.\n\nHume was also known as a prankster, as some of his somewhat unusual compositions illustrate. His most notorious piece was \"An Invention for Two to Play upone one Viole\", also known as Prince's Almayne.<ref name=\":0\">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=POnaGO7Hcdg</ref> Two bows are required and the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the larger player. This work was notated in [[tablature]] and is indeed technically possible to play.<ref name=\":0\" /> His instructions to \"drum this with the backe of your bow\" in another piece, \"Harke, harke,\" from the ''First Part of Ayres'', constitute the earliest known use of ''[[col legno]]'' in Western music.<ref>Peter Walls, \"Bow\" II. Bowing, ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001): \u00a72, xi.</ref>\n\nAt Christmas 1629 he entered Charterhouse as a poor brother. His mind seems to have given way, for in July 1642 he published a rambling ''True Petition of Colonel Hume'' to parliament offering either to defeat the rebels in Ireland with a hundred 'instruments of war,' or, if furnished with a complete navy, to bring the king within three months twenty millions of money. He styles himself 'colonel,' but the rank was probably of his own invention, for in the entry of his death, which took place at Charterhouse on Wednesday, 16 April 1645, he is still called Captain Hume.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nTobias Hume is the main character of the novel ''Loot and Loyalty'' written in by [[Jerzy Pietrkiewicz]]<ref \n name=\" :\u00d8\">https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.149694/page/n7/mode/2up</ref> \n\n{{listen|filename=Captaine Tobias Hume - Tobacco, No.3 The First Part of Ayres - The Musicall Humours1605.ogg|title=Tobacco, No.3 from the First Part of Ayres or the Musicall Humours (1605)|description=Performed by Phillip W.

Within his [[Virtue Party]], there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.\n\nWhen the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] and Erdo\u011fan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program.

Its introduction coincided with the period of sustained economic growth, allowing the Turkish government to put greater investments into the healthcare system.

The move, which Erdo\u011fan called one of the most radical reforms ever, was passed with fierce opposition. Turkey's three social security bodies were united under one roof, bringing equal health services and retirement benefits for members of all three bodies. The previous system had been criticized for reserving the best healthcare for civil servants and relegating others to wait in long queues. Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization. The bill also envisages a gradual increase in the retirement age: starting from 2036, the retirement age will increase to 65 by 2048 for both women and men.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|accessdate=3 December 2014|title=Social security law finally passes in Parliament|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=19 April 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052032/http://www.todayszaman.com/business_social-security-law-finally-passes-in-parliament_139477.html|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, the Turkish Parliament adopted a law to prohibit smoking in most public places.

Within his [[Virtue Party]], there was a dispute about the appropriate discourse of the party between traditional politicians and pro-reform politicians. The latter envisioned a party that could operate within the limits of the system, and thus not getting banned as its predecessors like [[National Order Party]], [[National Salvation Party]] and [[Welfare Party]]. They wanted to give the group the character of an ordinary [[conservatism|conservative party]] following the example of the European [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] parties.\n\nWhen the Virtue Party was also banned in 2001, a definitive split took place: the followers of [[Necmettin Erbakan]] founded the [[Felicity Party]] (SP) and the reformers founded the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) under the leadership of [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] and Erdo\u011fan. The pro-reform politicians realized that a strictly Islamic party would never be accepted as a governing party by the state apparatus and they believed that an Islamic party did not appeal to more than about 20 percent of the Turkish electorate. The AK party emphatically placed itself as a broad democratic conservative party with new politicians from the political center (like [[Ali Babacan]] and [[Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu]]), while respecting Islamic norms and values, but without an explicit religious program.

Under the second bill, everyone under the age of 18 years was entitled to free health services, irrespective of whether they pay premiums to any social security organization.
