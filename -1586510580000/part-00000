The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.\n\nIn March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and [[dimethadione]], both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] [[electric current|current]]s in [[T-type calcium channel]]s in freshly removed [[Thalamus|thalamic]] [[neuron]]s.<ref name = \"Coulter1989-1\" /> In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be [[voltage]]-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that [[Valproate|valproic acid]], which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that.<ref name=\"Coulter1989-2\" /> The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the [[Convulsant|pro-convulsant]] ones did not.<ref name = \"Coulter1990\" /> The first part was supported by [[Platon Kostyuk|Kostyuk]] et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in [[Dorsal root of spinal nerve|dorsal root]] [[ganglion|ganglia]] at concentrations ranging from 7 ''\u00b5''mol/L to 1&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name = \"Kostyuk\" />\n\nThat same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name = \"Herrington-Lingle\" /> The year after, a study conducted on human [[neocortex|neocortical]] cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.<ref name = \"sayer1993\" />\n\nIn 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 \u00b1 0.5&nbsp;mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported.<ref name = \"Todorovic_Lingle\" /> That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] current by 60% and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents by 39.1 \u00b1 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.<ref name = \"Leresche_et_al_1998\" />\n\nIn the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels.<ref name = \"Gomora_et_al_2001\" /> Using cloned [[CACNA1G|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>G]], [[CACNA1H|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>H]], and [[CACNA1I|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>I]] T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] of 12 \u00b1 2&nbsp;mmol/L and that of ''N''-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of [[mesuximide]]) is 1.95 \u00b1 0.19&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>G, 1.82 \u00b1 0.16&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>I, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.3&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.\n\n== Stereochemistry ==\nEthosuximide is a chiral drug with a [[stereocenter]].

The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.\n\nIn March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and [[dimethadione]], both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] [[electric current|current]]s in [[T-type calcium channel]]s in freshly removed [[Thalamus|thalamic]] [[neuron]]s.<ref name = \"Coulter1989-1\" /> In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be [[voltage]]-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that [[Valproate|valproic acid]], which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that.<ref name=\"Coulter1989-2\" /> The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the [[Convulsant|pro-convulsant]] ones did not.<ref name = \"Coulter1990\" /> The first part was supported by [[Platon Kostyuk|Kostyuk]] et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in [[Dorsal root of spinal nerve|dorsal root]] [[ganglion|ganglia]] at concentrations ranging from 7 ''\u00b5''mol/L to 1&nbsp;mmol/L.<ref name = \"Kostyuk\" />\n\nThat same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5&nbsp;mmol/L.{<ref name = \"Herrington-Lingle\" /> The year after, a study conducted on human [[neocortex|neocortical]] cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.<ref name = \"sayer1993\" />\n\nIn 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 \u00b1 0.5&nbsp;mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported.<ref name = \"Todorovic_Lingle\" /> That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating [[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] current by 60% and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> currents by 39.1 \u00b1 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na<sup>+</sup> current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.<ref name = \"Leresche_et_al_1998\" />\n\nIn the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels.<ref name = \"Gomora_et_al_2001\" /> Using cloned [[CACNA1G|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>G]], [[CACNA1H|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>H]], and [[CACNA1I|\u03b1<sub>1</sub>I]] T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an [[IC50|IC<sub>50</sub>]] of 12 \u00b1 2&nbsp;mmol/L and that of ''N''-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of [[mesuximide]]) is 1.95 \u00b1 0.19&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>G, 1.82 \u00b1 0.16&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>I, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.3&nbsp;mmol/L for \u03b1<sub>1</sub>H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.\n\n== Stereochemistry ==\nEthosuximide is a chiral drug with a [[stereocenter]].

He was the first general manager of the Bukit Sembawang Rubber Company Limited, formed in 1908. Nee Soon and Company was formed in 1911.\n\nNee Soon was one of the pioneers that opened up [[Sembawang]]. He served on the Rural Board from 1913 to 1921 and was also appointed a [[Justice]] of [[Peace]]. In the field of education, he was one of the [[wiktionary:Founder|founder]]s of [[The Chinese High School|Chinese High School]] and was a member of the Raffles College Committee. Nee Soon Road was officially named in 1950 by the Rural Board to facilitate [[Mail|postal services]]. Several roads in Yishun are named after his business concerns and family members. Nee Soon was a leading member of the [[Teochew people|Teochew]] clan association ''poit ip huay kwan'', and a close friend of Dr [[Sun Yat Sen]].\n\nThe name ''Nee Soon'' was one of those changed at the height of the campaign to replace [[dialect]] names with Mandarin ones. While the government later revoked some of its decisions and reinstated names like [[Bukit Panjang]] (for Zhenghua), Yishun remained unchanged and is now the name attached to streets, roads, parks and many amenities. That's pretty gay\n\n==Development==\nThe development of Yishun started in 1976 with the first HDB apartments being built at the Chong Pang area. Yishun Neighbourhood 1 was developed in 1981, followed by Neighbourhood 7 and Neighbourhood 2. Neighbourhood 6, 8 and 9 were developed in 1987, together with the Town Centre. Neighbourhood 3 and 4 followed slightly later in 1992. Construction of Neighbourhood 5 was started in 2009 and was completed in 2015. Within the Yishun vicinity, 8 of its neighbourhoods are allocated for construction of HDB apartments namely Yishun Neighbourhood 1 (Yishun North), Yishun Neighbourhood 2 (Taman Yishun), Yishun Neighbourhoods 3, 4 and 5 (Yishun East), Yishun Neighbourhood 6 and 9 (Yishun Central), Yishun Neighbourhood 7 (Yishun West), and Yishun Neighbourhood 8 (Yishun South).\n\nYishun planning areas contain the subzones of Yishun South, Yishun West, Northland, Yishun East, Nee Soon, Springleaf, Lower Seletar, Khatib and Yishun Central. \n\nSpringleaf and Nee Soon subzones are private housing estates in Yishun.\n\n==Amenities==\n\n===Shopping Malls===\n\n*[[Northpoint City, Singapore|Northpoint City]] - The largest shopping mall in the North, it is located beside [[Yishun MRT station]].
