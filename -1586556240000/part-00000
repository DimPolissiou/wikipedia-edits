As the typical practice of studying and creating the current vaccines in chicken eggs tends to result in mutations, 2017 was the first year that researchers used dog cells rather than chicken eggs to create the H3N2 component of the vaccine Flucelvax. However, due to cost, most Americans did not get Flucelvax in 2017 and 2018 and likely received vaccines grown with chicken eggs. ''The Atlantic'' noted that the vaccine still protected against other strains such as the H1N1 and B virus, and did provide at least some immunity to H3N2.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, ''The Atlantic'' also noted that the severity of the flu season in the United States may have been increased by a shortage of [[IV bags]] in hospitals. The shortage resulted from the [[Hurricane Maria]] blackout in [[Puerto Rico]], where a great many medical supplies are manufactured.

However, due to cost, most Americans did not get Flucelvax in 2017 and 2018 and likely received vaccines grown with chicken eggs.
