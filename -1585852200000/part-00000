While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]; Marlow has similar experiences to the author.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}</ref>\n\nWhen Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as \"a wild story\" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). In 1902 ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'', published on 13 November 1902 by [[William Blackwood]].\n\nThe volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''[[The End of the Tether]]'' in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an \"[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in ''Youth''.\n\nOn 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked,\n\n<blockquote>I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in\u2014as it were\u2014the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by scholars and literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous \"rear column\" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}</ref><ref name = \"ho\">{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-395-75924-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1/page/98 98], 145 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1 |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}</ref> Conrad's biographer [[Norman Sherry]] judged that Arthur Hodister (1847\u20131892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by the Congolese villagers among whom he worked to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conrad's Western World|last=Sherry|first=Norman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coosemans|first=M.|date=1948|title=Hodister, Arthur|url=|journal=Biographie Coloniale Belge|volume=I|pages=514\u2013518|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Envisioning Africa: Racism and Imperialism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness|last=Firchow|first=Peter|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201368}}</ref> [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[L\u00e9on Rom]] influenced the character.<ref>Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999). \"The Butcher of Congo\".

As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\". Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\". The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\". Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior. After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with {{convert|200|mi|abbr=on}} to go yet, takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some {{convert|30|mi|abbr=on}} up the river where his company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now lay sick and gaunt, awaiting death. Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck.\"\n\nMarlow must wait for ten days in the company's Outer Station. He sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\". The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\".\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]\n\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot about {{convert|200|mi|km}} into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved and tells him of a rumour that one important station is in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, is ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated. He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\". Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with. The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\".\n\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the repairs, delayed by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. He learns that Kurtz is not admired but rather resented by the manager. Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' (\"King of the Belgians\"\u2014French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]\nThe journey pauses for the night about {{convert|8|mi|km}} below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\"\n\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life and justice and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\n\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer; literary commentators say she is Kurtz's mistress. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hodister (1847-1892).jpg|thumb|Arthur Hodister (1847-1892), who Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry has argued served as one of the sources of inspiration for Kurtz]]\n\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\n\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip and Marlow becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper \"The horror! The horror!\". A short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" . The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.\n\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortably, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n\n==Reception==\nLiterary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's \"unique propensity for ambiguity\" but it was not a big success during Conrad's life.<ref name=\"Bloom2\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}</ref> When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, \"Youth\" and \"The End of the Tether\", it received the least commentary from critics.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> [[F.

Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, \"the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.\"<ref name=\"Bret Wood\">[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]; Marlow has similar experiences to the author.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}</ref>\n\nWhen Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as \"a wild story\" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). In 1902 ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'', published on 13 November 1902 by [[William Blackwood]].\n\nThe volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''[[The End of the Tether]]'' in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an \"[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in ''Youth''.\n\nOn 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked,\n\n<blockquote>I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in\u2014as it were\u2014the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by scholars and literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous \"rear column\" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}</ref><ref name = \"ho\">{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-395-75924-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1/page/98 98], 145 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1 |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}</ref> Conrad's biographer [[Norman Sherry]] judged that Arthur Hodister (1847\u20131892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by the Congolese villagers among whom he worked to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conrad's Western World|last=Sherry|first=Norman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coosemans|first=M.|date=1948|title=Hodister, Arthur|url=|journal=Biographie Coloniale Belge|volume=I|pages=514\u2013518|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Envisioning Africa: Racism and Imperialism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness|last=Firchow|first=Peter|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201368}}</ref> [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[L\u00e9on Rom]] influenced the character.<ref>Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999). \"The Butcher of Congo\".

As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\". Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\". The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\". Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior. After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with {{convert|200|mi|abbr=on}} to go yet, takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some {{convert|30|mi|abbr=on}} up the river where his company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now lay sick and gaunt, awaiting death. Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck.\"\n\nMarlow must wait for ten days in the company's Outer Station. He sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\". The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\".\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]\n\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot about {{convert|200|mi|km}} into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved and tells him of a rumour that one important station is in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, is ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated. He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\". Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with. The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\".\n\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the repairs, delayed by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. He learns that Kurtz is not admired but rather resented by the manager. Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' (\"King of the Belgians\"\u2014French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]\nThe journey pauses for the night about {{convert|8|mi|km}} below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\"\n\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life and justice and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\n\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer; literary commentators say she is Kurtz's mistress. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hodister (1847-1892).jpg|thumb|Arthur Hodister (1847-1892), who Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry has argued served as one of the sources of inspiration for Kurtz]]\n\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\n\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip and Marlow becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; as he dies, Marlow hears him weakly whisper \"The horror! The horror!\". A short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, in a scathing tone, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" . The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.\n\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world. Many callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortably, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n\n==Reception==\nLiterary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's \"unique propensity for ambiguity\" but it was not a big success during Conrad's life.<ref name=\"Bloom2\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}</ref> When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, \"Youth\" and \"The End of the Tether\", it received the least commentary from critics.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> [[F.

In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, \"the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.\"<ref name=\"Bret Wood\">[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

It can be found on his albums ''[[Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' as well as ''An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer''. The song is sung to the tune of [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]]'s \"[[Major General's Song]]\" (\"I am the very model of a modern major-general...\") from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.  Since that time, 16 more have been [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]]. At his concert in Copenhagen (1967), Lehrer admitted, \"I like to play this song every once in a while, just to see if I can still do it!\" Indeed, several of Lehrer's fans, such as actor Daniel Radcliffe, have tried and failed to sing it. That is, he sung it in its entirety, but with slight hiccups.<ref>{{YouTube|rSAaiYKF0cs|\"Daniel Radcliffe sings The Elements Song on The Graham Norton Show\"}}, broadcast November 12, 2010</ref> At some concerts he also played a version he claims is based on [[Aristotle]]'s elements: \"There's [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[Water (classical element)|water]].\"<ref>{{YouTube|kSKKPuNoA1g|\"Tom Lehrer performs alternate \"Aristotle\" version\"}}, clip from a live performance in 1967</ref>\n\n===\"Oedipus Rex\"===\nLehrer comments that most popular movies of the time have a catchy title song that helps to draw in audiences. Believing that a recent (1957) [[Oedipus Rex (1957 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' had failed at the box office because it did not have such a song, he wrote this one in [[ragtime]] style.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n \n===\"Clementine\"===\n\"Clementine\" is a parody of the old folk song \"[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]\" as it might have turned out had it had been written by various composers in widely different styles of music. The first verse was in the style of [[Cole Porter]] (suggestive of \"Night and Day\"); the second verse an [[aria]] for [[baritone]] in the style of [[Mozart]] \"or [[classical music|one of that crowd]]\"; the third verse in the style of the [[Beatnik]] \"Cool School\" (suggestive of [[Thelonious Monk]]'s \"[[52nd Street Theme]]\"); and the rousing finale was, in Lehrer's paraphrase of [[Shakespeare]], \"full of words and music, and signifying nothing,\" in the style of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] (suggestive of \"[[The Sorcerer#Synopsis|My name is John Wellington Wells]]\" or other patter songs). Lehrer's argument for rewriting the song is that folk songs in general are \"so atrocious, because they're written 'by the people',\" and that the original \"Clementine\" has \"no recognizable merit whatsoever.\"\n\n===\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\"===\nA parody of the official songs in use by the various branches of the United States military. Lehrer explains that the Army \"didn't have no official song\" when he started basic training; he wrote this one in an attempt to remedy the situation.

It can be found on his albums ''[[Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' as well as ''An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer''. The song is sung to the tune of [[Arthur Sullivan|Sir Arthur Sullivan]]'s \"[[Major General's Song]]\" (\"I am the very model of a modern major-general...\") from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''.  Since that time, 16 more have been [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]]. At his concert in Copenhagen (1967), Lehrer admitted, \"I like to play this song every once in a while, just to see if I can still do it!\" Indeed, several of Lehrer's fans, such as actor Daniel Radcliffe, have tried and failed to sing it. That is, he sung it in its entirety, but with slight hiccups.<ref>{{YouTube|rSAaiYKF0cs|\"Daniel Radcliffe sings The Elements Song on The Graham Norton Show\"}}, broadcast November 12, 2010</ref> At some concerts he also played a version he claims is based on [[Aristotle]]'s elements: \"There's [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[Air (classical element)|air]] and [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[Water (classical element)|water]].\"<ref>{{YouTube|kSKKPuNoA1g|\"Tom Lehrer performs alternate Aristotle version\"}}, clip from a live performance in 1967</ref>\n\n===\"Oedipus Rex\"===\nLehrer comments that most popular movies of the time have a catchy title song that helps to draw in audiences. Believing that a recent (1957) [[Oedipus Rex (1957 film)|film adaptation]] of [[Sophocles]]' play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' had failed at the box office because it did not have such a song, he wrote this one in [[ragtime]] style.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n \n===\"Clementine\"===\n\"Clementine\" is a parody of the old folk song \"[[Oh My Darling, Clementine]]\" as it might have turned out had it had been written by various composers in widely different styles of music. The first verse was in the style of [[Cole Porter]] (suggestive of \"Night and Day\"); the second verse an [[aria]] for [[baritone]] in the style of [[Mozart]] \"or [[classical music|one of that crowd]]\"; the third verse in the style of the [[Beatnik]] \"Cool School\" (suggestive of [[Thelonious Monk]]'s \"[[52nd Street Theme]]\"); and the rousing finale was, in Lehrer's paraphrase of [[Shakespeare]], \"full of words and music, and signifying nothing,\" in the style of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] (suggestive of \"[[The Sorcerer#Synopsis|My name is John Wellington Wells]]\" or other patter songs). Lehrer's argument for rewriting the song is that folk songs in general are \"so atrocious, because they're written 'by the people',\" and that the original \"Clementine\" has \"no recognizable merit whatsoever.\"\n\n===\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\"===\nA parody of the official songs in use by the various branches of the United States military. Lehrer explains that the Army \"didn't have no official song\" when he started basic training; he wrote this one in an attempt to remedy the situation.

It is one of the [[List of coastal weather stations in the British Isles|22 coastal weather stations]] whose reports are broadcast as part of the [[Shipping Forecast|BBC Shipping Forecast]]. Valentia Observatory is part of Met \u00c9ireann, the Irish Meteorological Service. The observatory was set up in August 1868. Valentia island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. The monthly averages for Sunshine and Rainfall are based on 2010 statistics which are around average apart from July, which received only 40% of its normal sunshine hours and 219% of its normal rainfall. Valentia island also has a station for [[Navtex]] transmissions. Valentia Island sits on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite it being on the same latitude as [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or south west winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub-tropical varieties of plants.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Valentia Island, [[County Kerry]] (1981\u20132010, extremes

It is one of the [[List of coastal weather stations in the British Isles|22 coastal weather stations]] whose reports are broadcast as part of the [[Shipping Forecast|BBC Shipping Forecast]]. Valentia Observatory is part of Met \u00c9ireann, the Irish Meteorological Service. The observatory was set up in August 1868. Valentia island is, on average, the wettest weather station in Ireland. The monthly averages for Sunshine and Rainfall are based on 2010 statistics which are around average apart from July, which received only 40% of its normal sunshine hours and 219% of its normal rainfall. Valentia island also has a station for [[Navtex]] transmissions. Valentia Island sits on the eastern edge of the Atlantic Ocean. Despite it being on the same latitude as [[St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. Anthony]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean, it enjoys much milder winters thanks to the moderating effect of prevailing west or south west winds, and the effects of the warming Gulf Stream current. Snow and frost are rare, and because of this the island can support many sub-tropical varieties of plants.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Valentia Island, [[County Kerry]] (1981\u20132010, extremes
