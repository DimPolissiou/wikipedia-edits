She gained notoriety for being the highest-paid spy in the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=82}}\n\nShippen was born into a prominent [[Philadelphia]] family with [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] tendencies. She met Arnold during his tenure as military commander of the city following the [[Philadelphia campaign#Valley Forge and Monmouth|British withdrawal in 1778]]. They were married in the Shippen townhouse on Fourth Street on April 8, 1779, and Arnold began conspiring with the British to change sides soon after. Peggy played a role in the conspiracy which was exposed after British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] was arrested in September 1780 carrying documents concerning the planned surrender of the critical [[Continental Army]] base at [[West Point]].\n\nArnold escaped to New York City and Peggy followed.  They traveled together to [[London]] at the end of 1781, where she established a home and Arnold rebuilt a trading business.  In 1787, she joined him in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], where his difficulties with local businessmen forced them to return to London in December 1791.  Arnold died in 1801, after which she had to settle his business affairs and pay off his debts.

Edward Shippen was a judge and member of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania;{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} the Shippen family was politically divided, and the judge was considered either a \"Neutralist\" or a covert \"Tory \" with allegiance to the British crown.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} Two younger boys died in infancy, and Peggy grew up as the baby of the family and was the \"family's darling.\"{{citation needed|date = August 2019}}\n\nSources{{which|date=August 2019}} related that Peggy enjoyed music, doing needlework, and drawing, and participated in the study of politics.

Shortly after, Arnold sent her father a letter asking for her hand, but Shippen was skeptical of Arnold due to Arnold's legal problems.  In 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania had brought eight formal charges against Arnold for corruption and malfeasance with the money of the federal and state governments, and he was subsequently convicted on two relatively minor counts.  Despite this, Edward Shippen eventually granted permission for Arnold and Peggy to marry, which took place on April 8, 1779.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}}\n\nArnold purchased [[Mount Pleasant (mansion)|Mount Pleasant]] on March 22, 1779, a manor home built in 1762 for Captain John Macpherson, and he deeded the property to Peggy and any future children.<ref>New York Times, June 7, 1896</ref>{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}} The couple did not live at Mount Pleasant, however, but rented it out as an income property. The couple honeymooned at family homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, then returned to Philadelphia to take residence at Arnold's military headquarters in the Masters-Penn mansion.\n\n==Espionage between the Arnolds and Major John Andr\u00e9==\nAs a newlywed, Peggy may have had contact with her \"dear friend\" [[John Andr\u00e9|Major Andr\u00e9]], who had become [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|General Clinton]]'s spy chief. She and Arnold also had close friends who were either actively Loyalist or sympathetic to that cause. Some historians believe that Peggy Shippen instigated the correspondence between Arnold and Andr\u00e9 and sent military secrets to the British before her wedding. Other suspects in Arnold's subsequent espionage ring with Andr\u00e9 were Loyalists Rev. [[Jonathan Odell]] and Joseph Stansbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|title=People of the Revolution|website=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519012550/http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|archivedate=19 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nArnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married.  General Clinton gave Major Andr\u00e9 orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between Andr\u00e9 and Arnold.  The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy's actions; letters written in her hand also include [[Arnold Cipher|coded communications]] written by Benedict Arnold in [[invisible ink]].\n\n[[File:ArnoldCipherLetter.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Image of a coded letter: Peggy Shippen Arnold's handwriting is interspersed with [[Arnold Cipher|coded writing]] in Benedict Arnold's hand; Arnold's writing would have been in [[invisible ink]]]]\nEnraged by his treatment in Philadelphia, General Arnold resigned his command there in March 1779. Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of [[West Point]], a critical American defense post in the highlands of the [[Hudson River]].  Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].

During Arnold's stay in New Brunswick, Peggy Shippen Arnold gave birth to their third surviving child Sophia Matilda Arnold, while her husband may have fathered an illegitimate child (John Sage) in New Brunswick.<ref>{{harvnb|Randall|1990|page=613}} Many historians suggest an Arnold liaison in New Brunswick, although Canadian historian Barry Wilson notes the weakness of the traditional account that Sage is the product of such a liaison. Sage's gravestone indicates that he was born on April 14, 1786, a date roughly confirmed by Benedict Arnold's will, which stated that Sage was 14 when Arnold wrote it in 1800. Arnold arrived in New Brunswick in December 1785, so Sage's mother could not have been from there. Wilson believes that the explanation most consistent with the available documentation is that Sage was either the result of a liaison before Arnold left England, or that he was Arnold's grandson by one of his older children.

She died in London in 1804, reportedly of cancer,{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=102}} and was buried with her husband at [[St. Mary's Church, Battersea|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Battersea]] on August 25, 1804.\n\n==Role in conspiracy==\n\nHistorians are unanimous in her complicity\u2014and she accepted a reward for her services from the king. Her family in Philadelphia denied everything. Arnold's biographer (so called because he is Arnold's ONLY biographer) [[Nathaniel Philbrick]] argues (in this quote which cites no evidence) that:\n:Peggy Shippen... did have a significant role in the plot. She exerted powerful influence on her husband, who is said to have been his own man but who actually was swayed by his staff and certainly by his wife. Peggy came from a loyalist family in Philadelphia; she had many ties to the British. She ... was the conduit for information to the British.<ref>Interview with Philbrick in Michael Dolan, \"Ero And Villain,\" ''American History'' (Aug 2016) 51#3 pp 12-13.</ref>\n\nPeggy's so-called \"loyalist family\" included her father, [[Edward Shippen]], who remained a powerful figure in post-revolutionary Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1791, Peggy's father was appointed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, serving with Jasper Yeates and Edward Burd, both kinsmen and former students. Shippen became chief justice in 1799 - all facts which disprove the myth of his \"loyalist\" reputation, as no loyalist would receive such prominence in post-revolutionary America. In fact, during the American revolution, Peggy's father attempted to stay neutral, hoping that the colonies and the mother country would be reconciled. He did not support the extension of royal authority and was therefore not a Loyalist, but he also opposed the radically democratic Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776, which sought to reduce the hold on government by powerful families like the Shippens<ref>Randolph Shipley Klein. \"Shippen, Edward IV\"; American National Biography Online, Feb. 2000.</ref>. Still, the baseless slander of his \"loyalist sympathies\" continue when every fact of the matter contradicts them.\n\n[[James Parton]], a biographer of [[Aaron Burr]], published an account in the 19th century, after all of the principal actors had died, implying that Peggy Shippen Arnold had manipulated or persuaded Benedict to change sides. The basis for the claim was interviews that he conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of [[Jacques Marcus Prevost]] who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at [[Paramus, New Jersey]]. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she \"was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting\", referring to her histrionics at West Point.{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}} According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold \"was disgusted with the American cause\" and \"through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the general into an arrangement to surrender West Point.\"{{sfn|Randall|1990|page=571}}\n\nWhen these allegations were first published, the Shippen family countered with allegations of improper behavior on Burr's part.

They traveled together to [[London]] at the end of 1781, where she established a home and Arnold rebuilt a trading business.

Edward Shippen was a judge and member of the Provincial Council of Pennsylvania;{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} the Shippen family was politically divided, and the judge was considered either a \"Neutralist\" or a covert \"Tory \" with allegiance to the British crown.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999| p=81}} Two younger boys died in infancy, and Peggy grew up as the baby of the family and was the \"family's darling.\"{{citation needed|date = August 2019}}\n\nSources{{which|date=August 2019}} related that Peggy enjoyed music, doing needlework, and drawing, and participated in the study of politics.

Shortly after, Arnold sent her father a letter asking for her hand, but Shippen was skeptical of Arnold due to Arnold's legal problems.  In 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania had brought eight formal charges against Arnold for corruption and malfeasance with the money of the federal and state governments, and he was subsequently convicted on two relatively minor counts.  Despite this, Edward Shippen eventually granted permission for Arnold and Peggy to marry, which took place on April 8, 1779.{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}}\n\nArnold purchased [[Mount Pleasant (mansion)|Mount Pleasant]] on March 22, 1779, a manor home built in 1762 for Captain John Macpherson, and he deeded the property to Peggy and any future children.<ref>New York Times, June 7, 1896</ref>{{sfn|Randall|Nahra|1999|p=90}} The couple did not live at Mount Pleasant, however, but rented it out as an income property. The couple honeymooned at family homes in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, then returned to Philadelphia to take residence at Arnold's military headquarters in the Masters-Penn mansion.\n\n==Espionage between the Arnolds and Major John Andr\u00e9==\nAs a newlywed, Peggy may have had contact with her \"dear friend\" [[John Andr\u00e9|Major Andr\u00e9]], who had become [[Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1730)|General Clinton]]'s spy chief. She and Arnold also had close friends who were either actively Loyalist or sympathetic to that cause. Some historians believe that Peggy Shippen instigated the correspondence between Arnold and Andr\u00e9 and sent military secrets to the British before her wedding. Other suspects in Arnold's subsequent espionage ring with Andr\u00e9 were Loyalists Rev. [[Jonathan Odell]] and Joseph Stansbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|title=People of the Revolution|website=Si.umich.edu|accessdate=10 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519012550/http://www.si.umich.edu/spies/people.html|archivedate=19 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nArnold hired Joseph Stansbury to initiate communications in May 1779, offering his services to the British not long after he married.  General Clinton gave Major Andr\u00e9 orders to pursue the possibility, and secret communications began between Andr\u00e9 and Arnold.  The messages that they exchanged were sometimes transmitted through Peggy's actions; letters written in her hand also include [[Arnold Cipher|coded communications]] written by Benedict Arnold in [[invisible ink]].\n\n[[File:ArnoldCipherLetter.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Image of a coded letter: Peggy Shippen Arnold's handwriting is interspersed with [[Arnold Cipher|coded writing]] in Benedict Arnold's hand; Arnold's writing would have been in [[invisible ink]]]]\nEnraged by his treatment in Philadelphia, General Arnold resigned his command there in March 1779. Pursuant to the secret communications with the British, he sought and obtained the command of [[West Point]], a critical American defense post in the highlands of the [[Hudson River]].  Peggy and their infant son Edward Shippen Arnold (born 19 Mar 1780) joined him there in a home on the Hudson two miles south of West Point. General Arnold systematically weakened the defenses of West Point with the intent of making it easier for the British to capture.\n\nOn Thursday, September 21, 1780, General Arnold met with Andr\u00e9 on the shores of the Hudson River and gave him documents and maps about the fortifications at West Point in anticipation of the British capture of that site. On Saturday, September 23, Andr\u00e9 was arrested as he rode towards British territory, the documents were discovered, and the plot was exposed.  On Monday, September 25, Arnold received a note announcing Andr\u00e9's capture and possession of treasonous papers and maps. That same morning, General [[George Washington]] was planning to meet Arnold at his home, two miles south of West Point. Arnold first dashed upstairs to Peggy, then fled, eventually reaching HMS ''Vulture'' on the Hudson River.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|pages=94\u201396}}\n\nPeggy Shippen Arnold was then dressing in anticipation of hosting a breakfast for Washington and his party. Possibly based on a brief discussion with her husband, she pretended hysteria in order to falsely convince General Washington and his staff that she had nothing to do with her husband's betrayal.  The delay caused by her histrionics may have allowed Arnold time to escape, leaving Peggy with their infant son.  Fearing for her safety, she traveled to Philadelphia to stay with her family.  She also played the innocent when asked about her husband, even though she knew his whereabouts.  Philadelphia authorities soon found a letter from Andr\u00e9 to Peggy written from British-occupied New York\u2014the so-called \"millinery letter\"\u2014and seized upon it as proof that Arnold's wife had been complicitous in the treason. That led the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania to banish her from Philadelphia. In November 1780, her father escorted Peggy and her infant son to the shores of the Hudson where she boarded a boat to New York City to join Arnold.{{sfn|Stuart|2013|page=112}}<ref>{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Clare | title = The Man in the Mirror: A Life of Benedict Arnold | publisher = Random House | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-679-40106-7 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 234\u2013238] | url = https://archive.org/details/maninmirrorlifeo00bran/page/234 }}</ref>\n\nAfter a military trial, Major Andr\u00e9 was condemned to death as a common spy and was hanged at [[Tappan, New York]].
