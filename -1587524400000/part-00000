Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.  The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Slater had the best performance, and scored the most touchdowns in the game.  Haddon, Hoagland, and Thompson also scored.  The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

His interest in science was instilled by an older sister, Dr. [[Dorothy Krieger]], who won a [[Lasker Award]] for her research in [[endocrinology]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTerrace obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1957) and a Master of Arts in Experimental Psychology (1958) from [[Cornell University]], where he was a [[Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation]] Fellow\u00a0(1957\u20131958). His mentor during graduate studies was [[Julian Hochberg]]. He obtained his PhD in Psychology (1961) from [[Harvard University]], where his mentor was [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref name=\"PHD\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/herbert-s-terrace-phd |title = Herbert S.

When a discrimination is trained with errors, subjects exhibit frustration. Such aversive effects are absent when a discrimination is trained without errors.<ref name=\"1966 Discrimination Inhibition\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H.

The teaching machine introduces a new topic with simple questions that are gradually made more difficult.<ref name=\"1961 Skinner\">{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|date=1961|title=Teaching Machines|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=205(5)|pages=90\u2013107|via=}}</ref> Subjects who learn with few or no errors don\u2019t exhibit the frustration they would have experienced had they learned by trial and error.<ref name=\"1968 Discrimination Peak Shift\" />\n\n=== Ape Language and The Evolution of Language ===\nTerrace joined other leading behaviorists challenging [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that only humans can learn language and grammar. With [[Project Nim]], he attempted to teach a chimpanzee ([[Nim Chimpsky]]),<ref name=\"1979 Nim\" /><ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" /> to learn [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]]. Sign language was used because of the physical limitations of a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus. Nim\u2019s vocabulary grew steadily and he began to combine signs. However, analyses of videotapes of Nim signing with his teachers showed that most of his signs were cued by a teacher\u2019s prompts.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" />\n\nTerrace concluded that the only reason Nim (and other chimpanzees) signed was to obtain rewards.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" /><ref name=\"1985 Beginning\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=1985|title=In the beginning was the name|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=40|pages=1011\u20131028|via=}}</ref> Were it not for his teacher, Nim would try to grab a reward directly. When that failed, Nim's only alternative was to sign. Anticipating his signing, Nim's teachers unwittingly made one or more appropriate signs, about a quarter of a second before he signed. Terrace also showed that prompting explained the signing of other chimpanzees who were trained to use ASL.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" />\n\nBecause chimpanzees only signed to obtain rewards, their signing was, by definition, limited to the imperative function of words. That differs fundamentally from its declarative function, which is to name objects conversationally. Imperatives are a miniscule portion of human vocabulary. If human communication were limited to imperatives, language would have never evolved.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> Initially, Terrace hoped that combinations of a chimpanzee\u2019s signs would provide evidence that it could create a sentence. What Project Nim showed, however, is that a chimpanzee can\u2019t even use signs declaratively. Until a chimpanzee can learn words, he concluded that it\u2019s pointless to ask if it can create a sentence.<ref name=\"1979 Nim\" /><ref name=\"2019 Why\" /><ref name=\"2013 Agency\">{{Cite book|title=Agency and joint attention|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Metcalfe|editor-first=Janet|location=New York|pages=11\u201348|chapter=Becoming Human: Why two minds are better than one|editor-last2=Terrace|editor-first2=Herbert}}</ref>\n\nThe negative results of Project Nim posed two questions: why can't a chimpanzee learn language, words in particular, and which of our ancestors was the first species to use words? To answer the first question, Terrace cited recent discoveries by developmental psychologists who showed that, infants experience two ''non-verbal'' relations with their caretakers, intersubjectivity and joint attention before they learn to name objects.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /><ref name=\"2013 Agency\" /> He argued that the absence of those precursors in chimpanzees is the best explanation for their failure to learn words.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\nTo answer the second question, Terrace integrated hypotheses by an anthropologist<ref name=\"2009 Mothers\">{{Cite book|title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding|last=Hardy|first=S. B.|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> and a linguist<ref name=\"2014 Understanding\">{{Cite book|title=More Than Nature Needs: Language, Mind, and Evolution|last=Bickerton|first=D.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> who suggested that the caloric requirements of ''Homo erectus\u2019'' large brain was the motivation for their invention of words. Meat was the most efficient way to get those calories. Because [[Homo erectus]] couldn't hunt, they had to scavenge large animals. That required a group effort, in which a scout had to inform members of his group about the location of a dead animal they could not see. Because it required displaced reference, such communication was assumed to be the occasion for the first use words.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\nAlthough Project Nim confirmed Chomsky\u2019s view that language is uniquely human, it showed that the use of grammar was not sufficient to distinguish language from animal communication.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> The use of words, specifically, the ability to name objects, was also necessary. Chomsky argued that grammar was the result of a recent mutation<ref name=\"2016 Chomsky\">{{Cite book|title=Why only us|last=Berwick|first=R. C.|last2=Chomsky|first2=N.|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> and that the origin of words remained a mystery.<ref name=\"2017 Beginning\" /> Terrace argued that language originated with words, which are as different from the signals that animals use to communicate as words are from grammar.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> Unlike Chomsky, who argued that language was the result of a mutation, Terrace argued that words could be explained by natural selection.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\n=== Animal Cognition ===\nAlthough chimpanzees can\u2019t learn language, there's evidence that their behavior, and that of other animals, is more intelligent than behavior that could result from conditioning.<ref name=\"1984 Cognition\" /> Since Descartes, it has been generally accepted that animals can't think because they don't have language.<ref name=\"1985 Thinking\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=1985|title= Animal cognition: Thinking without language.\u201dPhilosophical Transactions of Royal Society London\u201d |url=|journal=B|volume=B308(1135)|pages=113\u2013128|via=}}</ref> To explain intelligent behavior in animals without language and without the principles of conditioning, Terrace argued that it is necessary to show that they can represent objects, that is, solve a problem in the absence of external cues that can guide their behavior.<ref name=\"1984 Animal Cognition\" />\n\n==== Serial Learning ====\nThe [[simultaneous training paradigm]] differs from the traditional [[successive training paradigm]] in which subjects execute a sequence by responding to individual stimuli, which appear successively as, for example, learning which way to turn at successive choice points in a maze.<ref name=\"1984 Chaining\">{{Cite book|title=Quantitative Analyses of Behavior: Discrimination Processes|last=Terrace|first=H.

On each trial, the position of the photographs varied randomly. As a result, subjects couldn't rely on its physical location as an external cue for determining to which photograph it should respond first, second, and so on. Instead, they had to memorize the order of each photograph.<ref name=\"1984 Chaining\" /><ref name=\"2005 Simultanious Chain\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=2005|title=The simultaneous chain: A new approach to serial learning|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=9(4)|pages=202\u2013210|via=}}</ref>\n\nBecause the simultaneous training paradigm requires the subject to represent each item\u2019s ordinal position, it provides an opportunity to study animal cognition. In the early 80s, Terrace helped organize an international conference on animal cognition at Columbia University that discussed the simultaneous training paradigm and other instances in which animals are able to represent stimuli.<ref name=\"1984 Cognition\" /><ref name=\"1984 Animal Cognition\" /> Since then, animal cognition has become a dominant area in comparative cognition.\n\nIn 1985, Terrace began a primate cognition laboratory in which he studied how monkeys use representations in various serial learning tasks, for example, to respond in the correct order to ascending and descending series of numerically defined stimuli,<ref name=\"1998 Ordering\">{{Cite journal|last=Brannon|first=E.|last2=Terrace|first2=H.

In humans, metacognition is assessed by asking subjects how certain they are about their knowledge of a particular topic, for example, how well they did on an exam. To assess [[metacognition in monkeys]], Terrace devised a task in which the monkeys had to place a \u201cbet\u201d that was commensurate with their confidence in the accuracy of a response on a cognitive task.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kornell|first=N.|last2=Son|first2=L.

S.|date=2007|title=Transfer of metacognitive skills and hint seeking in monkeys|url=|journal=Psychological Science|volume=18(1)|pages=64\u201371|via=}}</ref> Following each response, monkeys learned to select a \u201chigh confidence\u201d symbol if their response was correct and a \u201clow confidence\u201d symbol after an error. They did so correctly even when the appearance of the confidence symbols was delayed for as much as 5 sec after a trial ended. This was the first demonstration that a monkey could think about its behavior.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2019}}\n*[[John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship]], 1969\u20131970 ([[University of Sussex]], England)\n*[[Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation|Harry Frank Guggenheim Fellowship]] 1976\u20131977 ([[Columbia University]])\n*[[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College Fellowship]], 1983\u20131984 ([[Oxford University]])\n*[[Fulbright Senior Scholar|Fulbright Senior Research Scholar]], 1983\u20131984 ([[Oxford University]])\n*Election to [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]], 1988\n*[[Howard Crosby Warren|Howard Crosby Warren Medal]], [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]], 2004\n*Lifetime Achievement Award, [[Comparative Cognition Society]], 2009\n\n=== Grants ===\nSince 1962, Terrace's research has been funded by grants from the [[NIH]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and the [[James S.

His interest in science was instilled by an older sister, Dr. [[Dorothy Krieger]], who won a [[Lasker Award]] for her research in [[endocrinology]].{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\nTerrace obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (1957) and a Master of Arts in Experimental Psychology (1958) from [[Cornell University]], where he was a [[Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation]] Fellow\u00a0(1957\u20131958). His mentor during graduate studies was [[Julian Hochberg]]. He obtained his PhD in Psychology (1961) from [[Harvard University]], where his mentor was [[B. F. Skinner]].<ref name=\"PHD\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/herbert-s-terrace-phd |title = Herbert S.

When a discrimination is trained with errors, subjects exhibit frustration. Such aversive effects are absent when a discrimination is trained without errors.<ref name=\"1966 Discrimination Inhibition\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H.

The teaching machine introduces a new topic with simple questions that are gradually made more difficult.<ref name=\"1961 Skinner\">{{Cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|date=1961|title=Teaching Machines|url=|journal=Scientific American|volume=205(5)|pages=90\u2013107|via=}}</ref> Subjects who learn with few or no errors don\u2019t exhibit the frustration they would have experienced had they learned by trial and error.<ref name=\"1968 Discrimination Peak Shift\" />\n\n=== Ape Language and The Evolution of Language ===\nTerrace joined other leading behaviorists challenging [[Noam Chomsky]]'s theory that only humans can learn language and grammar. With [[Project Nim]], he attempted to teach a chimpanzee ([[Nim Chimpsky]]),<ref name=\"1979 Nim\" /><ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" /> to learn [[American Sign Language (ASL)]]. Sign language was used because of the physical limitations of a chimpanzee's vocal apparatus. Nim\u2019s vocabulary grew steadily and he began to combine signs. However, analyses of videotapes of Nim signing with his teachers showed that most of his signs were cued by a teacher\u2019s prompts.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" />\n\nTerrace concluded that the only reason Nim (and other chimpanzees) signed was to obtain rewards.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" /><ref name=\"1985 Beginning\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=1985|title=In the beginning was the name|url=|journal=American Psychologist|volume=40|pages=1011\u20131028|via=}}</ref> Were it not for his teacher, Nim would try to grab a reward directly. When that failed, Nim's only alternative was to sign. Anticipating his signing, Nim's teachers unwittingly made one or more appropriate signs, about a quarter of a second before he signed. Terrace also showed that prompting explained the signing of other chimpanzees who were trained to use ASL.<ref name=\"1979 Sentence\" />\n\nBecause chimpanzees only signed to obtain rewards, their signing was, by definition, limited to the imperative function of words. That differs fundamentally from its declarative function, which is to name objects conversationally. Imperatives are a miniscule portion of human vocabulary. If human communication were limited to imperatives, language would have never evolved.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> Initially, Terrace hoped that combinations of a chimpanzee\u2019s signs would provide evidence that it could create a sentence. What Project Nim showed, however, is that a chimpanzee can\u2019t even use signs declaratively. Until a chimpanzee can learn words, he concluded that it\u2019s pointless to ask if it can create a sentence.<ref name=\"1979 Nim\" /><ref name=\"2019 Why\" /><ref name=\"2013 Agency\">{{Cite book|title=Agency and joint attention|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Metcalfe|editor-first=Janet|location=New York|pages=11\u201348|chapter=Becoming Human: Why two minds are better than one|editor-last2=Terrace|editor-first2=Herbert}}</ref>\n\nThe negative results of Project Nim posed two questions: why can't a chimpanzee learn language, words in particular, and which of our ancestors was the first species to use words? To answer the first question, Terrace cited recent discoveries by developmental psychologists who showed that, infants experience two ''non-verbal'' relations with their caretakers, intersubjectivity and joint attention before they learn to name objects.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /><ref name=\"2013 Agency\" /> He argued that the absence of those precursors in chimpanzees is the best explanation for their failure to learn words.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\nTo answer the second question, Terrace integrated hypotheses by an anthropologist<ref name=\"2009 Mothers\">{{Cite book|title=Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding|last=Hardy|first=S. B.|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> and a linguist<ref name=\"2014 Understanding\">{{Cite book|title=More Than Nature Needs: Language, Mind, and Evolution|last=Bickerton|first=D.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> who suggested that the caloric requirements of ''Homo erectus\u2019'' large brain was the motivation for their invention of words. Meat was the most efficient way to get those calories. Because [[Homo erectus]] couldn't hunt, they had to scavenge large animals. That required a group effort, in which a scout had to inform members of his group about the location of a dead animal they could not see. Because it required displaced reference, such communication was assumed to be the occasion for the first use words.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\nAlthough Project Nim confirmed Chomsky\u2019s view that language is uniquely human, it showed that the use of grammar was not sufficient to distinguish language from animal communication.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> The use of words, specifically, the ability to name objects, was also necessary. Chomsky argued that grammar was the result of a recent mutation<ref name=\"2016 Chomsky\">{{Cite book|title=Why only us|last=Berwick|first=R. C.|last2=Chomsky|first2=N.|publisher=MIT Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref> and that the origin of words remained a mystery.<ref name=\"2017 Beginning\" /> Terrace argued that language originated with words, which are as different from the signals that animals use to communicate as words are from grammar.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" /> Unlike Chomsky, who argued that language was the result of a mutation, Terrace argued that words could be explained by natural selection.<ref name=\"2019 Why\" />\n\n=== Animal Cognition ===\nAlthough chimpanzees can\u2019t learn language, there's evidence that their behavior, and that of other animals, is more intelligent than behavior that could result from conditioning.<ref name=\"1984 Cognition\" /> Since Descartes, it has been generally accepted that animals can't think because they don't have language.<ref name=\"1985 Thinking\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=1985|title= Animal cognition: Thinking without language.\u201dPhilosophical Transactions of Royal Society London\u201d |url=|journal=B|volume=B308(1135)|pages=113\u2013128|via=}}</ref> To explain intelligent behavior in animals without language and without the principles of conditioning, Terrace argued that it is necessary to show that they can represent objects, that is, solve a problem in the absence of external cues that can guide their behavior.<ref name=\"1984 Animal Cognition\" />\n\n==== Serial Learning ====\nThe [[simultaneous training paradigm]] differs from the traditional [[successive training paradigm]] in which subjects execute a sequence by responding to individual stimuli, which appear successively as, for example, learning which way to turn at successive choice points in a maze.<ref name=\"1984 Chaining\">{{Cite book|title=Quantitative Analyses of Behavior: Discrimination Processes|last=Terrace|first=H.

On each trial, the position of the photographs varied randomly. As a result, subjects couldn't rely on its physical location as an external cue for determining to which photograph it should respond first, second, and so on. Instead, they had to memorize the order of each photograph.<ref name=\"1984 Chaining\" /><ref name=\"2005 Simultanious Chain\">{{Cite journal|last=Terrace|first=H. S.|date=2005|title=The simultaneous chain: A new approach to serial learning|url=|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=9(4)|pages=202\u2013210|via=}}</ref>\n\nBecause the simultaneous training paradigm requires the subject to represent each item\u2019s ordinal position, it provides an opportunity to study animal cognition. In the early 80s, Terrace helped organize an international conference on animal cognition at Columbia University that discussed the simultaneous training paradigm and other instances in which animals are able to represent stimuli.<ref name=\"1984 Cognition\" /><ref name=\"1984 Animal Cognition\" /> Since then, animal cognition has become a dominant area in comparative cognition.\n\nIn 1985, Terrace began a primate cognition laboratory in which he studied how monkeys use representations in various serial learning tasks, for example, to respond in the correct order to ascending and descending series of numerically defined stimuli,<ref name=\"1998 Ordering\">{{Cite journal|last=Brannon|first=E.|last2=Terrace|first2=H.

In humans, metacognition is assessed by asking subjects how certain they are about their knowledge of a particular topic, for example, how well they did on an exam. To assess [[metacognition in monkeys]], Terrace devised a task in which the monkeys had to place a \u201cbet\u201d that was commensurate with their confidence in the accuracy of a response on a cognitive task.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kornell|first=N.|last2=Son|first2=L.

S.|date=2007|title=Transfer of metacognitive skills and hint seeking in monkeys|url=|journal=Psychological Science|volume=18(1)|pages=64\u201371|via=}}</ref> Following each response, monkeys learned to select a \u201chigh confidence\u201d symbol if their response was correct and a \u201clow confidence\u201d symbol after an error. They did so correctly even when the appearance of the confidence symbols was delayed for as much as 5 sec after a trial ended. This was the first demonstration that a monkey could think about its behavior.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2019}}\n*[[John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship]], 1969\u20131970 ([[University of Sussex]], England)\n*[[Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation|Harry Frank Guggenheim Fellowship]] 1976\u20131977 ([[Columbia University]])\n*[[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College Fellowship]], 1983\u20131984 ([[Oxford University]])\n*[[Fulbright Senior Scholar|Fulbright Senior Research Scholar]], 1983\u20131984 ([[Oxford University]])\n*Election to [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]], 1988\n*[[Howard Crosby Warren|Howard Crosby Warren Medal]], [[Society of Experimental Psychologists]], 2004\n*Lifetime Achievement Award, [[Comparative Cognition Society]], 2009\n\n=== Grants ===\nSince 1962, Terrace's research has been funded by grants from the [[NIH]], [[National Science Foundation|NSF]] and the [[James S.

It was rare to find wind or stringed instrument players close to dancers in the same scene. However, it was noted that whenever musicians are depicted, dancers were not generally far away.\n\n== Types of dancing ==\nLexov\u00e1 set out classifications for the various dances of the period: the purely movemental dance, the gymnastic dance, the imitative dance, the pair dance, the group dance, the [[war dance]], the dramatic dance, the lyrical dance, the grotesque dance, the funeral dance and the [[Sacred dance|religious dance]].<ref name=\"Lexova\"/>\n\nDance scholar and performer Elizabeth \"Artemis\" Mourat also categorized dances into six types: religious dances, non-religious dances, banquet dances, harem dances, combat dances and street dances.<ref name=\"Music & Dance\"/>\n\n=== Solo, pair and group dances ===\n[[File:Tomb of the Dancers (detail).JPG|thumb|Tomb of the Dancers, wall painting, 17th Dynasty, Thebes, [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]]]\n\nAncient Egyptian dancers danced either as [[Solo dance|soloists]], in [[Couple dance|pairs]] or in [[Group dance|groups]], depending on the occasion and type of the dance performed.

The dances used symmetrical and dramatic movements and conveyed emotions such as longing or depression.<ref name=\"Kassing 46\"/>\n\n==== Group dances ====\nThere were two types of Egyptian group dances. One was performed in individual movements that confirmed a theme or idea or was carried out spontaneously as in prehistoric times. Dancers competed with one another, often in groups, substituting movement that were later established in funeral dances rites.(Lexov\u00e1 1935) A second type featured pairs or ranks of dancers who executed repetitive movements in a circle.

It involved leaping or skipping and was accompanied by a sung or spoken prayer to the sounds of percussion, including the clapping of hands and sticks.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nAnother specialized troupe of sacred dancers, ''mww'' or muu dancers, existed across the Kingdoms.

The dancing scenes portrayed in temples reflected both royal and divine ceremonies. All dancing scenes had one common feature that being the solemn procession of the sacred barks carrying a god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Festive dances ===\nAmong the festivals during which dancing took place the following are enumerated:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n* [[Sed festival]] dances took place during jubilee ceremonies which celebrated the renewal pledge to the king. Such dances varied in accordance to the religious significance and the reflection of the local mythology of the God to whom they were directed.\n* [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley|Valley festival]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] celebrates the God [[Amun]]'s trip from [[Karnak]] temple to visit the tombs on the West Bank passing by the sanctuary of Hathor. As the procession moved from one place to another, families rejoiced and danced.\n* [[Opet Festival]]: another event associated with God Amun's visit to his wife Goddess [[Mut]] from Karnak Temple to [[Luxor]] temple. This procession was marked by groups of women doing acrobatic dances together with dark dancers, probably [[Nubia]]ns who jumped and merged with the drums.\n* Feast of Min: god of fertility and regeneration: The dancers in this feast were members of his cult. Drawings representing this feast showed priests and monkeys dancing. These drawings could have had a symbolic meaning rather than an actual representation of reality.\n* Nile Flood Feast: (The New Year celebration): Dancing played a vital role in this festivity as it helped transform the dangerous [[Sekhmet]] into the mild Hathor, thereby protecting the ancient land from Sekhmet's evil and deadly demons. These dances included all possible forms of movement including acrobats and exotic foreign dances.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Kinney, Troy; Kinney, Margaret West (1914).

It was rare to find wind or stringed instrument players close to dancers in the same scene. However, it was noted that whenever musicians are depicted, dancers were not generally far away.\n\n== Types of dancing ==\nLexov\u00e1 set out classifications for the various dances of the period: the purely movemental dance, the gymnastic dance, the imitative dance, the pair dance, the group dance, the [[war dance]], the dramatic dance, the lyrical dance, the grotesque dance, the funeral dance and the [[Sacred dance|religious dance]].<ref name=\"Lexova\"/>\n\nDance scholar and performer Elizabeth \"Artemis\" Mourat also categorized dances into six types: religious dances, non-religious dances, banquet dances, harem dances, combat dances and street dances.<ref name=\"Music & Dance\"/>\n\n=== Solo, pair and group dances ===\n[[File:Tomb of the Dancers (detail).JPG|thumb|Tomb of the Dancers, wall painting, 17th Dynasty, Thebes, [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]]]\n\nAncient Egyptian dancers danced either as [[Solo dance|soloists]], in [[Couple dance|pairs]] or in [[Group dance|groups]], depending on the occasion and type of the dance performed. Individual or solo dances included performances by the king or priests designated as his representatives.

An image from this time depicted female pair dancers with canes. [[5th dynasty]] female dancers are shown to hold hands while performing in unison. The dances used symmetrical and dramatic movements and conveyed emotions such as longing or depression.<ref name=\"Kassing 46\"/>\n\n==== Group dances ====\nThere were two types of Egyptian group dances. One was performed in individual movements that confirmed a theme or idea or was carried out spontaneously as in prehistoric times. Dancers competed with one another, often in groups, substituting movement that were later established in funeral dances rites.(Lexov\u00e1 1935) A second type featured pairs or ranks of dancers who executed repetitive movements in a circle. Banquets and festivals often included performances by trained pair dancers.<ref name=\"Kassing 46\"/>\n\n=== Funeral dances ===\n{{further|Ancient Egyptian funerary practices#Funerary rituals}}\n[[File:Funerary banquet of Nebamun.jpg|thumb|left|A fragment of the frescoes on the wall of the tomb chapel of Nebamun, depicting guests, servants, musicians, and dancers at a funerary banquet]]\nDances associated with funerals included ritual, postures and gestures and secular dances.<ref name=\"Kassing 45\">Kassing 2000, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOld Kingdom performers included a specialized group of female dancers called \u201cthe acacia house.\u201d<ref name=\"Dunn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/dance.htm |title=To Dance in Ancient Egypt |last=Dunn|first=Jimmy |date=August 4, 2011 |publisher=Tour Egypt}} Retrieved November 3, 2018.</ref> Dances by the acacia house followed mummification and were aimed at appeasing the goddess [[Sekhmet]] and rejuvenating and mourning the dead.

It involved leaping or skipping and was accompanied by a sung or spoken prayer to the sounds of percussion, including the clapping of hands and sticks.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nAnother specialized troupe of sacred dancers, ''mww'' or muu dancers, existed across the Kingdoms.

The dances they performed were farewell performances associated with the departure of the sun. The dwarfs were used as they were thought to represent the sun due to their stunted growth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} There are indications that dancing dwarfs replaced ''mww'' dancers at the tomb entrance by the twentieth dynasty.<ref name=\"Bleiberg\"/><ref name=\"Lexova 62\">Lexov\u00e1 2000, p. 62.</ref> Lexov\u00e1 notes an image of the dancers of the dwarf dances wearing similar crowns.<ref name=\"Lexova 62\"/>\n\nAfter the New Kingdom changes of tomb decoration took place funerary dances were no longer depicted on tomb walls but were found in temples instead. The dancing scenes portrayed in temples reflected both royal and divine ceremonies. All dancing scenes had one common feature that being the solemn procession of the sacred barks carrying a god.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n=== Festive dances ===\nAmong the festivals during which dancing took place the following are enumerated:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n* [[Sed festival]] dances took place during jubilee ceremonies which celebrated the renewal pledge to the king. Such dances varied in accordance to the religious significance and the reflection of the local mythology of the God to whom they were directed.\n* [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley|Valley festival]] at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] celebrates the God [[Amun]]'s trip from [[Karnak]] temple to visit the tombs on the West Bank passing by the sanctuary of Hathor. As the procession moved from one place to another, families rejoiced and danced.\n* [[Opet Festival]]: another event associated with God Amun's visit to his wife Goddess [[Mut]] from Karnak Temple to [[Luxor]] temple. This procession was marked by groups of women doing acrobatic dances together with dark dancers, probably [[Nubia]]ns who jumped and merged with the drums.\n* Feast of Min: god of fertility and regeneration: The dancers in this feast were members of his cult. Drawings representing this feast showed priests and monkeys dancing. These drawings could have had a symbolic meaning rather than an actual representation of reality.\n* Nile Flood Feast: (The New Year celebration): Dancing played a vital role in this festivity as it helped transform the dangerous [[Sekhmet]] into the mild Hathor, thereby protecting the ancient land from Sekhmet's evil and deadly demons. These dances included all possible forms of movement including acrobats and exotic foreign dances.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Kinney, Troy; Kinney, Margaret West (1914).

He was first introduced to music when, as a young child, he would listen to [[Country music|country and western]] music on a Zenith console radio and his father would play the guitar. He watched the Lawrence Welk show on TV at his grandparents' home where he saw [[Neil Levang|Neil LeVang]] and [[Buddy Merrill]]. His grandparents had a [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]; his father would pump the organ while Steve sat on his lap and worked out melodies on the keyboard. When he was eight years old, he began taking guitar lessons on a [[Lap steel guitar]]. He saw and heard [[Jerry Byrd]] play lap steel and learned what could be done on the instrument. He eventually switched to standard guitar and was influenced by the music of [[Chet Atkins]], [[The Ventures]] and [[Duane Eddy]].<ref name=herald>{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/steve-hunter-a-guitar-icon-with-some-serious-friends/216142|title=Steve Hunter a Guitar Icon with Some Serious Friends|publisher=Herald de Paris|date=August 27, 2013|last=Hernandez|first=Al Carlos|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHunter continued playing guitar throughout high school where he played in a group called the Weejuns, taking their name from G.H. Bass & Co.'s perennially-popular penny loafers. He subsequently joined the Light Brigade, a rock and soul group that played in the Decatur area.\n\nIn 1967, during the Vietnam War, Hunter was drafted into the Army, trained as an x-ray technician, and served in an air evacuation hospital in Okinawa, Japan where Vietnam combat casualties were being treated. He considered becoming a doctor but he enjoyed music so much he knew he would follow a career in music.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.glidemagazine.com/37642/steve-hunter/||title=Steve Hunter|publisher=Glide Magazine|date=June 15, 2013|last=Derrough|first=Leslie Michele|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon completion of his stint in the Army, he returned to Decatur where he built a reputation as an outstanding guitar player. \nOne day he got a telephone call from his Decatur friend, [[John Sauter|John \"Polar Bear\" Sauter]], that changed his life.\n\n==Career==\nHunter has had an illustrious 40-year career as a session musician, band member and as a solo performer.\n\n===Work with Mitch Ryder===\nJohn Sauter called Hunter to tell him that he was playing with [[Mitch Ryder]] in Detroit and that Ryder was auditioning for guitar players.  He suggested that Hunter come to Detroit and try out. Hunter packed up his guitar and made the eight-hour drive to Detroit.\nHunter made the cut and became part of Mitch Ryder's new band [[Detroit (band)|Detroit]]. There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]]. They had a hit with a cover of Lou Reed's \"Rock & Roll\".

His first recording with Cooper was in 1973 as a session musician on the second-to-last and most successful album recorded by the Alice Cooper Group, ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]''. When Alice Cooper became a solo artist, Hunter followed and appeared on the 1975 groundbreaking album and live show ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'' alongside guitarist [[Dick Wagner]] as seen in the film ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare (film)|Welcome to My Nightmare]]''. Released on home video in 1976, it features the celebrated guitar face-off between Hunter and Wagner that formed part of Cooper's 1975 live show.

He watched the Lawrence Welk show on TV at his grandparents' home where he saw [[Neil Levang|Neil LeVang]] and [[Buddy Merrill]]. His grandparents had a [[Pump organ|Harmonium]]; his father would pump the organ while Steve sat on his lap and worked out melodies on the keyboard. When he was eight years old, he began taking guitar lessons on a [[Lap steel guitar]]. He saw and heard [[Jerry Byrd]] play lap steel and learned what could be done on the instrument. He eventually switched to standard guitar and was influenced by the music of [[Chet Atkins]], [[The Ventures]] and [[Duane Eddy]].<ref name=herald>{{cite web|url=http://www.heralddeparis.com/steve-hunter-a-guitar-icon-with-some-serious-friends/216142|title=Steve Hunter a Guitar Icon with Some Serious Friends|publisher=Herald de Paris|date=August 27, 2013|last=Hernandez|first=Al Carlos|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nHunter continued playing guitar throughout high school where he played in a group called the Weejuns, taking their name from G.H.

There Hunter met and formed a long-time professional association with producer [[Bob Ezrin]].\nDetroit released one self-titled album on [[Paramount Records]].

Since 2012, [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[United Airlines]] cap their regional airlines' jets at 76 seats and [[maximum take-off weight]] at 86,000 lb (39 t).<ref name=Flight20mar2018>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-are-us-airlines-at-their-next-scope-crossr-446881/ |title= Are US airlines at their next scope crossroads? |date= 20 March 2018 |author= Edward Russell |work= Flightglobal}}</ref>\n\nThese aircraft are widely used by commuter airlines such as [[SkyWest]] and [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]]. The low rate of fuel consumption, which translates to low cost of operation, makes regional jets ideal for use as commuter aircraft or to connect lower traffic airports to large or medium hub airports. Regional jets are heavily used in the US [[Essential Air Service]] program.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s\u20131970s===\n\nIn 1959 was introduced the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] (80\u2013140 seats), ordered by [[Flag Carrier]]s, the first purpose-built short-haul jetliner, a twin [[turbojet]] design for inter-European routes. The Caravelle used the forward [[fuselage]] nose section of the [[de Havilland Comet]], the first commercial [[jetliner]], not effective for continental-European flights. The [[BAC One-Eleven]] (89\u2013119 seats) was then introduced in 1965.\n\nIn 1968, [[Aeroflot]] introduced the 32 seat [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] and the 65\u201385 seats [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] was introduced in 1969. In 1975, the 40\u201344 seats [[VFW-Fokker 614]] saw service entry with its distinctive overwing engines, 19 were built. Some business jets like the [[British Aerospace 125]] (first delivery: 1964) and [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (1965) were operated by small airlines from the 1960s, and the small [[Aerospatiale Corvette]] (1974) was used as a regional airliner from the 1970s.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:British Aerospace BAe-146-100, Dan-Air London AN1918743.jpg|thumb|The [[Bae 146]] started service in May 1983]]\n\nIn 1978, the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]] led to route [[liberalization]], favouring small airliners demand. US passengers were disappointed by these, lacking [[aircraft lavatory|aircraft lavatories]] or [[flight attendant]]s of larger jet aircraft. As feeder routes grew, [[regional airlines]] replaced these small aircraft with larger turboprop airliners to feed larger [[airline hub]]s. These medium airliners were then supplanted by faster, longer range, regional jets like the first [[Bombardier CRJ100/200]]. Early small jets had higher operating costs than turboprops on short routes. The gap narrowed with better turbofans, and closed with the higher [[Rental utilization|utilization]] due to higher speeds.\n\nIn 1983 [[British Aerospace]] introduced its [[BAe 146]] short-range jet, produced in three sizes between 70 and 112 seats: the \u2212100, \u2212200 and the largest \u2212300, later renamed the Avro Regional Jet. Low [[aircraft noise]] and short takeoffs were suited to city-center to city-center service, a small market niche, like the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]], but four engines led to higher maintenance costs than twin-engine designs and BAe did not produce a lower operating cost twin-engine design, unlike the [[Dash 8]].\n\nIn 1988 was introduced the 97\u2013122 seats [[Fokker 100]], a stretched F28, followed by the shorter, 72\u201385 seats [[Fokker 70]] in 1994.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Bombardier CRJ-100 Lufthansa D-ACJJ - MSN 7298 - Now in UTair fleet as VQ-BGU (3238726666).jpg|thumb|The [[Bombardier CRJ-100]] was introduced in 1992 and was stretched in the [[CRJ700]] series]]\n[[File:N11187 (2767181410).jpg|thumb|The [[Embraer ERJ family]] began in April 1997]]\n\nLow fuel prices drove the development of the regional jet: in the '90s [[oil price]]s were around $10\u201320 per barrel. [[Turboprop]] manufacturers wanted to develop their portfolio. [[Canadair]]'s purchase by [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] in 1986 enabled a 50-seat stretched development of its [[Challenger business jet]], green-lighted by then chief executive [[Laurent Beaudoin]] in March 1989. The first Bombardier four-abreast [[Canadair Regional Jet]] was delivered in October 1992 to [[Lufthansa CityLine]].<ref name= FG120410>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-boom-and-bust-the-regional-jet-phenomenon-370541/ |title= Boom and bust, the regional jet phenomenon |date= 10 April 2012 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n\n[[Embraer]] then developed the 50-seat three-abreast [[Embraer ERJ 145|ERJ 145]] from the [[EMB-120 Brasilia]] turboprop, which was introduced in December 1996. They replaced the turboprops thanks to their better perceived image and larger range. On small-capacity long routes, they could offer a better service by increasing frequencies at a smaller capacity and could replace mainline [[jet airliner]]s like [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]s and [[Boeing 737]]s.<ref name= FG120410/>\nThey can be used for direct airport-to-airport flights, to the detriment of the [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke model]].\n\nSince 1999, the [[Fairchild Dornier 328JET]] was also competing but the type did not enter large scale production as [[Fairchild Dornier]] went bankrupt, also ending the larger [[Fairchild Dornier 728 family]] development. The CRJ/ERJ also resulted in the end of the BAe 146 line.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe CRJ and ERJ success also played a minor part in the failure of [[Fokker]], whose [[Fokker 100]] found itself squeezed on both sides by new models of the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A319]] on the \"large\" side and the RJs on the \"small side\".{{cn|date=April 2019}} On 5 February 1996, Bombardier started looking at a [[takeover]] of a struggling [[Fokker]], producer of the [[Fokker 100]] 100-seater.

Pilot unions then demanded to regulate subcontracted aircraft size to a 50 seats maximum [[scope clause]]. In turn, large routes were served by suboptimal 50-seat jets which accelerated demand for those types in [[North America]]. Embraer envisioned a market for more than 500 aircraft and planned to produce up to 80 a year, but at peak delivered 157 ERJs in 2000 while Bombardier delivered 155 CRJs in 2003.<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nAfter [[9/11]], high fuel prices returned and jets had to grow to keep seat-mile costs down. Airlines renegotiated scope clause limits to 70-seat jets as the market [[Consolidation (business)|consolidates]]. Larger aircraft came back on regional routes for their [[efficiency]] and on short routes turboprops don't lose too much time for a lower cost, reversing the 1990s trend. Bombardier delivered its last 50-seat CRJ in 2006 and Embraer its last ERJ in 2011.<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nBombardier switched to its lengthened 70- to 100-seat [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700]]/900/1000, while Embraer launched the four-abreast [[E-Jet]]170/175/190/195. 50 seats jets demand is lower with high fuel prices, and it reflects on a lower [[market value]]. A majority of them will be [[scrapped]].<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nBombardier and Embraer have been locked in a series of counter-lawsuits over export taxes and subsidies. The ERJ's success led to a totally new version, the [[Embraer E-Jets]] series.\n\nAlthough not as economical as the turboprop, by flying directly to and from smaller airports, they reduced the need for low-cost regional airliners.\n\nThe 68\u201399 seats [[Antonov An-148]], designed and produced by [[Antonov]] in Ukraine, made its maiden flight on 17 December 2004 after a development started in the 1990s, its was certified on 26 February 2007 and introduced in 2009.

The low rate of fuel consumption, which translates to low cost of operation, makes regional jets ideal for use as commuter aircraft or to connect lower traffic airports to large or medium hub airports. Regional jets are heavily used in the US [[Essential Air Service]] program.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s\u20131970s===\n\nIn 1959 was introduced the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]] (80\u2013140 seats), ordered by [[Flag Carrier]]s, the first purpose-built short-haul jetliner, a twin [[turbojet]] design for inter-European routes. The Caravelle used the forward [[fuselage]] nose section of the [[de Havilland Comet]], the first commercial [[jetliner]], not effective for continental-European flights. The [[BAC One-Eleven]] (89\u2013119 seats) was then introduced in 1965.\n\nIn 1968, [[Aeroflot]] introduced the 32 seat [[Yakovlev Yak-40]] and the 65\u201385 seats [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] was introduced in 1969. In 1975, the 40\u201344 seats [[VFW-Fokker 614]] saw service entry with its distinctive overwing engines, 19 were built. Some business jets like the [[British Aerospace 125]] (first delivery: 1964) and [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (1965) were operated by small airlines from the 1960s, and the small [[Aerospatiale Corvette]] (1974) was used as a regional airliner from the 1970s.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:British Aerospace BAe-146-100, Dan-Air London AN1918743.jpg|thumb|The [[Bae 146]] started service in May 1983]]\n\nIn 1978, the US [[Airline Deregulation Act]] led to route [[liberalization]], favouring small airliners demand. US passengers were disappointed by these, lacking [[aircraft lavatory|aircraft lavatories]] or [[flight attendant]]s of larger jet aircraft. As feeder routes grew, [[regional airlines]] replaced these small aircraft with larger turboprop airliners to feed larger [[airline hub]]s. These medium airliners were then supplanted by faster, longer range, regional jets like the first [[Bombardier CRJ100/200]]. Early small jets had higher operating costs than turboprops on short routes. The gap narrowed with better turbofans, and closed with the higher [[Rental utilization|utilization]] due to higher speeds.\n\nIn 1983 [[British Aerospace]] introduced its [[BAe 146]] short-range jet, produced in three sizes between 70 and 112 seats: the \u2212100, \u2212200 and the largest \u2212300, later renamed the Avro Regional Jet. Low [[aircraft noise]] and short takeoffs were suited to city-center to city-center service, a small market niche, like the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]], but four engines led to higher maintenance costs than twin-engine designs and BAe did not produce a lower operating cost twin-engine design, unlike the [[Dash 8]].\n\nIn 1988 was introduced the 97\u2013122 seats [[Fokker 100]], a stretched F28, followed by the shorter, 72\u201385 seats [[Fokker 70]] in 1994.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Bombardier CRJ-100 Lufthansa D-ACJJ - MSN 7298 - Now in UTair fleet as VQ-BGU (3238726666).jpg|thumb|The [[Bombardier CRJ-100]] was introduced in 1992 and was stretched in the [[CRJ700]] series]]\n[[File:N11187 (2767181410).jpg|thumb|The [[Embraer ERJ family]] began in April 1997]]\n\nLow fuel prices drove the development of the regional jet: in the '90s [[oil price]]s were around $10\u201320 per barrel. [[Turboprop]] manufacturers wanted to develop their portfolio. [[Canadair]]'s purchase by [[Bombardier Inc.|Bombardier]] in 1986 enabled a 50-seat stretched development of its [[Challenger business jet]], green-lighted by then chief executive [[Laurent Beaudoin]] in March 1989. The first Bombardier four-abreast [[Canadair Regional Jet]] was delivered in October 1992 to [[Lufthansa CityLine]].<ref name= FG120410>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-boom-and-bust-the-regional-jet-phenomenon-370541/ |title= Boom and bust, the regional jet phenomenon |date= 10 April 2012 |work= Flight Global}}</ref>\n\n[[Embraer]] then developed the 50-seat three-abreast [[Embraer ERJ 145|ERJ 145]] from the [[EMB-120 Brasilia]] turboprop, which was introduced in December 1996. They replaced the turboprops thanks to their better perceived image and larger range. On small-capacity long routes, they could offer a better service by increasing frequencies at a smaller capacity and could replace mainline [[jet airliner]]s like [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]s and [[Boeing 737]]s.<ref name= FG120410/>\nThey can be used for direct airport-to-airport flights, to the detriment of the [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke model]].\n\nSince 1999, the [[Fairchild Dornier 328JET]] was also competing but the type did not enter large scale production as [[Fairchild Dornier]] went bankrupt, also ending the larger [[Fairchild Dornier 728 family]] development. The CRJ/ERJ also resulted in the end of the BAe 146 line.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe CRJ and ERJ success also played a minor part in the failure of [[Fokker]], whose [[Fokker 100]] found itself squeezed on both sides by new models of the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A319]] on the \"large\" side and the RJs on the \"small side\".{{cn|date=April 2019}} On 5 February 1996, Bombardier started looking at a [[takeover]] of a struggling [[Fokker]], producer of the [[Fokker 100]] 100-seater.

Pilot unions then demanded to regulate subcontracted aircraft size to a 50 seats maximum [[scope clause]]. In turn, large routes were served by suboptimal 50-seat jets which accelerated demand for those types in [[North America]]. Embraer envisioned a market for more than 500 aircraft and planned to produce up to 80 a year, but at peak delivered 157 ERJs in 2000 while Bombardier delivered 155 CRJs in 2003.<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nAfter [[9/11]], high fuel prices returned and jets had to grow to keep seat-mile costs down. Airlines renegotiated scope clause limits to 70-seat jets as the market [[Consolidation (business)|consolidates]]. Larger aircraft came back on regional routes for their [[efficiency]] and on short routes turboprops don't lose too much time for a lower cost, reversing the 1990s trend. Bombardier delivered its last 50-seat CRJ in 2006 and Embraer its last ERJ in 2011.<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nBombardier switched to its lengthened 70- to 100-seat [[Bombardier CRJ700|CRJ700]]/900/1000, while Embraer launched the four-abreast [[E-Jet]]170/175/190/195. 50 seats jets demand is lower with high fuel prices, and it reflects on a lower [[market value]]. A majority of them will be [[scrapped]].<ref name= FG120410/>\n\nBombardier and Embraer have been locked in a series of counter-lawsuits over export taxes and subsidies. The ERJ's success led to a totally new version, the [[Embraer E-Jets]] series.\n\nAlthough not as economical as the turboprop, by flying directly to and from smaller airports, they reduced the need for low-cost regional airliners.\n\nThe 68\u201399 seats [[Antonov An-148]], designed and produced by [[Antonov]] in Ukraine, made its maiden flight on 17 December 2004 after a development started in the 1990s, its was certified on 26 February 2007 and introduced in 2009.

''[[Pixie Hollow (video game)|Pixie Hollow]]'', and ''Club Penguin'', with ''[[The World of Cars Online|World of Cars]]'' set to follow soon. Lane Merrifield assured GlobalToyNews at the time that \"it's a lot of worlds to manage, but we have really strong teams.\" Merrifield's role changed from taking a backseat in daily game design to focusing on overall branding and quality control of the virtual gaming properties. One of his roles was to merge the ''Club Penguin'' studio New Horizon Interactive in Kelowna (renamed to Disneyland Studios Canada) with Disneyland Studios LA. Disneyland Studios Canada focused its efforts on one product (with such features as multilingual versions), while Disneyland Studios LA focused on customer products and franchises of a wide selection of games.
