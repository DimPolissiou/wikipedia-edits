Grayson Hunt ([[Steven Blum]]) is the leader of Dead Echo, a black ops team under command of Star General Earl Sarrano ([[Anthony De Longis]]). Following Sarrano's orders and assassinating alleged criminals, Dead Echo kills a man known as Bryce Novak. Immediately after, they discover Novak was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Realizing they have been tricked by Sarrano, Grayson and his team [[desertion|desert]] and become space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces.\n\nTen years later, Grayson commands a ship with his old teammates, Ishi Sato ([[Andrew Kishino]]), Rell Julian ([[Chris Cox (voice actor)|Chris Cox]]), and Dr. Whit Oliver ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]). He spots Sarrano's battlecruiser, the ''Ulysses'' near the planet of Stygia. In a drunken rage, he attacks and rams the Ulysses. The ships collide and crash land on the surface of Stygia, critically wounding Ishi.\n\nTo save Ishi, Grayson and Rell leave the ship to find an energy cell for the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson reaches one of the ''Ulysses'' escape pods, and retrieves the pod's energy cell, and a device called an \"instinct leash.\" The leash provides him with strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills. Grayson and Rell return with the energy cell, and Doc begins replacing several of Ishi's body parts with cybernetics, including an AI processor for parts of his brain. In the middle of the operation, the mutants attack their ship, killing Doc, Rell, and leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg.\n\nGrayson and Ishi decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. Throughout the game, the AI processor in Ishi's brain takes over several times, fueled by his anger at Grayson's selfish and reckless actions which killed their teammates and put them in danger.\n\nThe instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka ([[Jennifer Hale]]), a Final Echo soldier. She agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi under the condition that they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a training ground. The instinct leash is a means of ranking the user. Only by scoring kills can the soldier get more ammunition and supplies to survive. Upon learning that Trishka was Novak's daughter, Grayson tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but lies about his involvement.\n\nThe three fight their way to Sarrano's escape pod, which landed on a skyscraper. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he pushes her off the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi of an armed \"DNA bomb\" on the ''Ulysses'' that will wipe out all life on the planet. He urges them to disarm it as his rescue ship will not arrive in time.\n\nAs they travel to the Ulysses, Sarrano explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the planet. They rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the planet's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation. Aboard the Ulysses, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall.\n\nThe three race to Sarrano's rescue ship and get on board. They fight through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually confront him. Trishka demands to know who killed her father, and Sarrano reveals Grayson's squad carried out the order. As the heroes argue, Sarrano hijacks Ishi's computer systems and forces Ishi to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control, and Ishi sacrifices himself to save his teammate. Enraged, Grayson impales Sarrano on the debris sticking out of the wall. Sarrano, still alive, ejects Grayson and Trishka out of the rescue ship.\n\nGrayson and Trishka race back to the ''Ulysses'' and board an unused escape pod. They launch it into low orbit, then the explosion of the DNA bomb propels the pod into space. Inside the pod, the two talk about Grayson's revenge, the loss of his team, and Sarrano's escape. Trishka asks Grayson what he is going to do about Sarrano escaping, and the screen fades to black.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], it is revealed that Sarrano was revived as a cyborg. Ishi also survives and is now taken over by the AI processor.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Bulletstorm - Skill shot system screenshot .gif|thumb|left|Screenshot of the \"skillshot\" system]]\nAs a [[first-person shooter]], ''Bulletstorm'' focuses on combat. There are a variety of fictional firearms available, each with distinct behavior, from a pistol to a cannon that shoots a [[bolas]] weighted by grenades. Each weapon has an \"alternate fire\" mode which uses \"charges\"; for example, the assault rifle's \"charge shot\" is a single volley of bullets that destroy almost everything in its path.\n\nMuch of the story and gameplay puts focus on the \"energy leash\", a rope of energy projected from a device on Grayson's left hand. The leash allows him to pull enemies towards him, activate certain devices and traps, and slam down a ball of energy that launches all nearby enemies into the air. The player can also kick enemies or run and slide into them. If an enemy is launched into the air from the whip or by being kicked/slid into, he goes into slow motion, allowing players to perform skillshots.\n\n\"Skillshot\" is one of the game's unique features in which it rewards the player for killing opponents in the most creative and destructive ways possible. Points are rewarded by various actions, such as killing enemies in midair, making use of environmental hazards or utilizing a weapon's distinct feature. The more complicated or unusual the skillshot, the more points players acquire. Points are used as currency at \"dropkits\" scattered across the planet to purchase firearms, ammunition and upgrades. The dropkits include a shop, a skillshot checklist, and gameplay statistics.\n\nThe player can carry up to three firearms, the assault rifle is the default one and is always carried. ''Bulletstorm'' uses a [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|recharging health]] system, in which damage to the player is reflected by the screen turning red, and the player quickly returns to full health when not taking damage.\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=678|title=Interview with Adrian Chmielarz|first=Krystian|last=Smoszna|date=February 8, 2010|access-date=February 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725112652/http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=678|archive-date=July 25, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, [[Electronic Arts]] announced that it would be publishing a new [[Intellectual property|IP]] from independent game developer [[Epic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5037277/ea-to-publish-new-ip-title-from-epic|title=EA To Publish New IP Title From Epic|first=Stuart|last=Houghton|date=August 14, 2008|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=April 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220651/http://kotaku.com/5037277/ea-to-publish-new-ip-title-from-epic|archive-date=October 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A trademark for the name \"Bulletstorm\" was revealed when game developer [[People Can Fly]] filed a trademark for the name in December 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5436469/painkiller-developers-predicting-a-bulletstorm|title=Painkiller Developers Predicting A Bulletstorm|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=April 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220706/http://kotaku.com/5436469/painkiller-developers-predicting-a-bulletstorm|archive-date=October 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Epic Games designer [[Cliff Bleszinski]] was originally scheduled to announce the game alongside ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' during an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on April 8, 2010.

Grayson Hunt ([[Steven Blum]]) is the leader of Dead Echo, a black ops team under command of Star General Earl Sarrano ([[Anthony De Longis]]). Following Sarrano's orders and assassinating alleged criminals, Dead Echo kills a man known as Bryce Novak. Immediately after, they discover Novak was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Dead Echo. Realizing they have been tricked by Sarrano, Grayson and his team [[desertion|desert]] and become space pirates on the run from Sarrano's forces.\n\nTen years later, Grayson commands a ship with his old teammates, Ishi Sato ([[Andrew Kishino]]), Rell Julian ([[Chris Cox (voice actor)|Chris Cox]]), and Dr. Whit Oliver ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]). He spots Sarrano's battlecruiser, the ''Ulysses'' near the planet of Stygia. In a drunken rage, he attacks and rams the Ulysses. The ships collide and crash land on the surface of Stygia, critically wounding Ishi.\n\nTo save Ishi, Grayson and Rell leave the ship to find an energy cell for the ship's medical equipment. On the planet, a former popular tropical-like resort, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. Grayson reaches one of the ''Ulysses'' escape pods, and retrieves the pod's energy cell, and a device called an \"instinct leash.\" The leash provides him with strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills. Grayson and Rell return with the energy cell, and Doc begins replacing several of Ishi's body parts with cybernetics, including an AI processor for parts of his brain. In the middle of the operation, the mutants attack their ship, killing Doc, Rell, and leaving Ishi a disfigured cyborg.\n\nGrayson and Ishi decide to work together to get off the planet, despite Ishi's disapproval of Grayson's thirst for revenge. Throughout the game, the AI processor in Ishi's brain takes over several times, fueled by his anger at Grayson's selfish and reckless actions which killed their teammates and put them in danger.\n\nThe instinct leash leads Grayson to another escape pod, where they find Trishka ([[Jennifer Hale]]), a Final Echo soldier. She agrees to work with Grayson and Ishi under the condition that they rescue Sarrano. As they battle through the ravaged city, Trishka explains that Stygia has been used by Final Echo as a training ground. The instinct leash is a means of ranking the user. Only by scoring kills can the soldier get more ammunition and supplies to survive. Upon learning that Trishka was Novak's daughter, Grayson tells her that Sarrano was responsible for her father's death, but lies about his involvement.\n\nThe three fight their way to Sarrano's escape pod, which landed on a skyscraper. Trishka accuses Sarrano of her father's death, but he pushes her off the building. Sarrano then warns Grayson and Ishi of an armed \"DNA bomb\" on the ''Ulysses'' that will wipe out all life on the planet. He urges them to disarm it as his rescue ship will not arrive in time.\n\nAs they travel to the Ulysses, Sarrano explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the planet. They rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the planet's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation. Aboard the Ulysses, Sarrano tricks Grayson and Ishi into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by Trishka, who survived the fall.\n\nThe three race to Sarrano's rescue ship and get on board. They fight through Sarrano's elite troops and eventually confront him. Trishka demands to know who killed her father, and Sarrano reveals Grayson's squad carried out the order. As the heroes argue, Sarrano hijacks Ishi's computer systems and forces Ishi to turn on his friends. Grayson manages to break Sarrano's control, and Ishi sacrifices himself to save his teammate. Enraged, Grayson impales Sarrano on the debris sticking out of the wall. Sarrano, still alive, ejects Grayson and Trishka out of the rescue ship.\n\nGrayson and Trishka race back to the ''Ulysses'' and board an unused escape pod. They launch it into low orbit, then the explosion of the DNA bomb propels the pod into space. Inside the pod, the two talk about Grayson's revenge, the loss of his team, and Sarrano's escape. Trishka asks Grayson what he is going to do about Sarrano escaping, and the screen fades to black.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], it is revealed that Sarrano was revived as a cyborg. Ishi also survives and is now taken over by the AI processor.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Bulletstorm - Skill shot system screenshot .gif|thumb|left|Screenshot of the \"skillshot\" system]]\nAs a [[first-person shooter]], ''Bulletstorm'' focuses on combat. There are a variety of fictional firearms available, each with distinct behavior, from a pistol to a cannon that shoots a [[bolas]] weighted by grenades. Each weapon has an \"alternate fire\" mode which uses \"charges\"; for example, the assault rifle's \"charge shot\" is a single volley of bullets that destroy almost everything in its path.\n\nMuch of the story and gameplay puts focus on the \"energy leash\", a rope of energy projected from a device on Grayson's left hand. The leash allows him to pull enemies towards him, activate certain devices and traps, and slam down a ball of energy that launches all nearby enemies into the air. The player can also kick enemies or run and slide into them. If an enemy is launched into the air from the whip or by being kicked/slid into, he goes into slow motion, allowing players to perform skillshots.\n\n\"Skillshot\" is one of the game's unique features in which it rewards the player for killing opponents in the most creative and destructive ways possible. Points are rewarded by various actions, such as killing enemies in midair, making use of environmental hazards or utilizing a weapon's distinct feature. The more complicated or unusual the skillshot, the more points players acquire. Points are used as currency at \"dropkits\" scattered across the planet to purchase firearms, ammunition and upgrades. The dropkits include a shop, a skillshot checklist, and gameplay statistics.\n\nThe player can carry up to three firearms, the assault rifle is the default one and is always carried. ''Bulletstorm'' uses a [[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|recharging health]] system, in which damage to the player is reflected by the screen turning red, and the player quickly returns to full health when not taking damage.\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment began in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=678|title=Interview with Adrian Chmielarz|first=Krystian|last=Smoszna|date=February 8, 2010|access-date=February 22, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725112652/http://www.gry-online.pl/S018.asp?ID=678|archive-date=July 25, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, [[Electronic Arts]] announced that it would be publishing a new [[Intellectual property|IP]] from independent game developer [[Epic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5037277/ea-to-publish-new-ip-title-from-epic|title=EA To Publish New IP Title From Epic|first=Stuart|last=Houghton|date=August 14, 2008|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=April 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220651/http://kotaku.com/5037277/ea-to-publish-new-ip-title-from-epic|archive-date=October 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A trademark for the name \"Bulletstorm\" was revealed when game developer [[People Can Fly]] filed a trademark for the name in December 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5436469/painkiller-developers-predicting-a-bulletstorm|title=Painkiller Developers Predicting A Bulletstorm|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|date=December 29, 2009|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=April 20, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016220706/http://kotaku.com/5436469/painkiller-developers-predicting-a-bulletstorm|archive-date=October 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Epic Games designer [[Cliff Bleszinski]] was originally scheduled to announce the game alongside ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' during an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on April 8, 2010.
