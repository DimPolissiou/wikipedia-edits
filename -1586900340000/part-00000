A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the [[Dada]] movement and [[surrealism]]. He had no formal artistic training, but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]]\u2014a technique that uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images\u2014and [[grattage]], an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He is also noted for his novels consisting of [[collage]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMax Ernst was born in [[Br\u00fchl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br\u00fchl]], near [[Cologne]], the third of nine children of a middle-class [[Catholic]] family. His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian. He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting.<ref name=\"chrono285\">Spies, Rewald 2005, 285\u2013286.</ref> In 1909 Ernst enrolled in the [[University of Bonn]] to read philosophy, art history, literature, psychology and psychiatry. He visited [[lunatic asylum|asylums]] and became fascinated with the YAAAA art work of the mentally ill patients; he also started painting that year, producing sketches in the garden of the Br\u00fchl castle, and portraits of his sister and himself. In 1911 Ernst befriended [[August Macke]] and joined his ''Die Rheinischen Expressionisten'' group of artists, deciding to become an artist.\n\nIn 1912 he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] profoundly influenced him. His work was exhibited that year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group, at Galerie Feldman in Cologne, and then in several group exhibitions in 1913.<ref name=\"chrono285\" /> In his paintings of this period, Ernst adopted an ironic style that juxtaposed grotesque elements alongside [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] motifs.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn 1914 Ernst met [[Hans Arp]] in Cologne. The two became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years. After Ernst completed his studies in the summer, his life was interrupted by [[World War I]]. Ernst was drafted and served both on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Fronts]]. The effect of the war on Ernst was devastating; in his autobiography, he wrote of his time in the army thus: \"On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918\".<ref>Spies, Rewald 2005, xiv.</ref> For a brief period on the Western Front, Ernst was assigned to chart maps, which allowed him to continue painting.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> Several [[German Expressionist]] painters died in action during the war, among them [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]].\n\n===Dada and surrealism===\n[[File:Ubu Imperator.jpg|thumb|right|Max Ernst, ''[[Ubu Roi|Ubu Imperator]]'', 1923, [[Musee National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]\nIn 1918, Ernst was demobilised and returned to Cologne. He soon married art history student [[Luise Straus-Ernst|Luise Straus]], whom he had met in 1914. In 1919, Ernst visited [[Paul Klee]] in Munich and studied paintings by [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. The same year, inspired by de Chirico and mail-order catalogues, teaching-aide manuals and similar sources, he produced his first [[collage]]s (notably ''Fiat modes'', a portfolio of [[lithograph]]s), a technique which would dominate his artistic pursuits. Also in 1919 Ernst, social activist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld]] and several colleagues founded the Cologne [[Dada]] group. In 1919\u201320 Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as ''Der Strom'', ''die Schammade'' and organised Dada exhibitions.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\nErnst and Luise's son [[Jimmy Ernst|Ulrich 'Jimmy' Ernst]] was born on 24 June 1920; he also became a painter.<ref name=\"chrono285\" /> Ernst's marriage to Luise was short-lived. In 1921 he met [[Paul \u00c9luard]], who became a lifelong friend. \u00c9luard bought two of Ernst's paintings (''Celebes'' and ''Oedipus Rex'') and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection ''R\u00e9p\u00e9titions''. A year later the two collaborated on ''Les malheurs des immortels'' and then with [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], whom Ernst met in 1921, on the magazine ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]''. In 1922, unable to secure the necessary papers, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] with \u00c9luard and his wife [[Gala Dal\u00ed|Gala]] in Paris suburb Saint-Brice, leaving behind his wife and son.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> During his first two years in Paris, Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint. In 1923 the \u00c9luards moved to a new home in [[Eaubonne]], near Paris, where Ernst painted numerous [[mural]]s. The same year his works were exhibited at ''Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants''.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\n[[File:Les Fusains.jpg|thumb|left|180px|\"Les Fusains\": 22, rue Tourlaque, [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] where Max Ernst established a studio in 1925]]\nAlthough apparently accepting the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, \u00c9luard eventually became more concerned about the affair. In 1924 he abruptly left, first for [[Monaco]] and then for [[Saigon]].<ref>Warlick, M.E. 2001. ''Max Ernst and Alchemy: a Magician in Search of Myth'', p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-292-79136-7}}</ref> He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip. Ernst went to D\u00fcsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend, [[Johanna Ey]], owner of gallery ''Das Junge Rheinland''.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> After a brief time together in Saigon, the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul. The \u00c9luards returned to Eaubonne in early September, while Ernst followed them some months later, after exploring more of South-East Asia. He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot that allowed him to paint full-time. In 1925 Ernst established a studio at 22, rue Tourlaque.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\nIn 1925, Ernst invented a graphic art technique called [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]] (see [[Surrealist techniques]]), which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 128.</ref> He also created the '[[grattage]]' technique, in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He used this technique in his famous painting ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (as shown at the Tate Modern). The next year he collaborated with [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] on designs for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. With Mir\u00f3's help, Ernst developed grattage, in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases. He also explored with the technique of [[decalcomania]], which involves pressing paint between two surfaces.<ref>Max Ernst working in decalcomania is shown in the 1978 documentary on the Dada and Surrealist art movement, ''Europe After the Rain''.</ref> Earst was also active, along with fellow Surrealists, at the [[Atelier 17]].<ref name=\"Swann Galleries\">{{cite web |title=Atelier 17: Europe and the Early Years |url=https://www.swanngalleries.com/news/19th-20th-century-prints-drawings/2011/10/atelier-17-europe-early-years/ |website=Swann Galleries News |accessdate=20 February 2020 |date=10 October 2011}}</ref> \n\nErnst developed a fascination with birds that was prevalent in his work. His alter ego in paintings, which he called [[Loplop]], was a bird. He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 285.</ref> He said that one night when he was young, he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died; a few minutes later, his father announced that his sister was born. Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists' work, such as ''Loplop presents Andr\u00e9 Breton''. Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting ''The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, and the Painter''.<ref>Image: [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Max_Ernst/view_1.asp?item=4&view=l The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist]</ref> In 1927, Ernst married {{Ill|Marie-Berthe Aurenche|de}} and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of ''The Kiss'' and other works of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Flint|first=Lucy, Guggenheim Collection|title=''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706214957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|archivedate=6 July 2015}}</ref> Ernst appeared in the 1930 film ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'', directed by the [[Surrealist]] [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]. Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with [[Alberto Giacometti]]. In 1938, the American heiress and artistic [[patron]] [[Peggy Guggenheim]] acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946.\n\n===World War II and later life===\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|''L'Ange du Foyer'', 1937]]\nIn September 1939, the outbreak of [[World War II]] caused Ernst to be interned as an \"undesirable foreigner\" in [[Camp des Milles]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], along with fellow surrealist, [[Hans Bellmer]], who had recently emigrated to Paris. He had been living with his lover and fellow surrealist painter, [[Leonora Carrington]] who, not knowing whether he would return, saw no option but to sell their house to repay their debts and leave for Spain. Thanks to the intercession of [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and other friends, including the journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was released a few weeks later. Soon after the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]], he was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]] but managed to escape and flee to America with the help of [[Peggy Guggenheim]] and Fry.<ref name=abc>{{Cite web|last=Olga's Gallery|title=Max Ernst biography|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/E/ernst/ernstbio.html}}</ref> Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=New Google Doodle Honors Surrealist Painter Leonora Carrington|url=http://time.com/3771801/google-doodle-leonora-carrington-surrealist-painter/|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=Time|date=6 April 2015}}</ref> Along with other artists and friends ([[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Marc Chagall]]) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of [[Abstract expressionism]].\n\nHis marriage to Guggenheim did not last and in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in October 1946, in a double ceremony with [[Man Ray]] and Juliet P. Browner, he married [[Dorothea Tanning]].<ref name=\"Juliet's obituary\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 January 1991 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}</ref> The couple made their home in [[Sedona, Arizona]] from 1946 to 1953, where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernst's earlier imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waldman|first1=Diane|title=Max Ernst : A Retrospective|date=1975|publisher=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Despite the fact that Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants and small Native American communities, their presence helped begin what would become an American [[artists' colony]]. Among the monumental red rocks, Ernst built a small cottage by hand on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst, who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. As a result of the book and its publicity, Ernst began to achieve financial success. From the 1950s he lived mainly in France. In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/max-ernst-1065 | work = Tate Etc. | title = Max Ernst 1891\u20131976}}</ref> He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].<ref name=abc/>\n\n==Selected works==\n\n===Paintings===\n\n====Early works====\n[[File:Houghton Typ 915.22.3605 R\u00e9p\u00e9titions, 1922 - cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''R\u00e9p\u00e9titions'', with illustrations by Max Ernst]]\n* ''[[Aquis Submersus]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Trophy, Hypertrophied]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person]]'' (1919\u20131920)\n* ''[[Murdering Airplane]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Hat Makes the Man]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Elephant Celebes|Celebes]]'' (1921)\n* ''Oedipus Rex'' (1922)\n\n====First French period====\n[[File:Max morise, max ernst e andr\u00e9 masson, cadaveri eccellenti (cadavre exquis), 1927.jpg|thumb|right|Collective surrealist artwork ''Cadavre exquis'', made by Max Ernst, [[Max Morise]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]] in 1927]]\n* ''[[Piet\u00e0 or Revolution by Night]]'' (1923)\n* ''Saint Cecilia'' (1923)\n* ''The Wavering Woman'' (1923)\n* ''Ubu Imperator'' (1923)\n* ''[[Of This Men Shall Know Nothing]]'' (1923)\n* ''Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale'' (1924)\n* ''Woman, Old Man and Flower'' (1924)\n* ''Paris Dream'' (1924\u201325)\n* ''The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist'' (1926)\n* ''Forest'' series, e.g. ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (1927), ''[[The Wood (Max Ernst)|The Wood]]'' (1927)\n* ''Rendezvous of Friends \u2013 The Friends Become Flowers'' (1928)\n* ''[[Loplop]]'' series, e.g. ''Loplop Introduces Loplop'' (1930), ''Loplop Introduces a Young Girl'' (1930)\n* ''City'' series, e.g. ''Petrified City'' (1933), ''Entire City'' (1935\u201336, two versions)\n* ''Garden Aeroplane Trap'' series (1935\u201336)\n* ''The Joy of Living'' (1936)\n* ''The Nymph Echo'' (1936)\n* ''The Fireside Angel'' (1937)\n* ''[[The Barbarians (painting)|The Barbarians]]'' (1937)\n* ''The Fascinating Cypress'' (1940)\n* ''The Robing of the Bride'' (1940)\n\n====American period====\n* ''Totem and Taboo'' (1941)\n* ''Marlene'' (1941)\n* ''[[Napoleon in the Wilderness]]'' (1941)\n* ''Day and Night'' (1941\u201342)\n* ''The Antipope '' (1942)\n* ''Europe After the Rain II'' (1940\u201342)\n* ''Surrealism and Painting'' (1942)\n* ''Vox Angelica'' (1943)\n* ''Everyone Here Speaks Latin'' (1943)\n* ''Painting for Young People'' (1943)\n* ''[[The Eye of Silence]]'' (1944)\n* ''Dream and Revolution'' (1945)\n* ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Ernst painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (1945)\n* ''The Phases of the Night'' (1946)\n* ''Design in Nature'' (1947)\n* ''A beautiful day'' (1948), featured in the [[Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art | ''Painting toward architecture'' exhibition]] (1947-52)<ref>(March 15, 2019).

A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the [[Dada]] movement and [[surrealism]]. He had no formal artistic training, but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]]\u2014a technique that uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images\u2014and [[grattage]], an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He is also noted for his novels consisting of [[collage]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMax Ernst was born in [[Br\u00fchl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br\u00fchl]], near [[Cologne]], the third of nine children of a middle-class [[Catholic]] family. His father Philipp was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, a devout Christian and a strict disciplinarian. He inspired in Max a penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature influenced Max to take up painting.<ref name=\"chrono285\">Spies, Rewald 2005, 285\u2013286.</ref> In 1909 Ernst enrolled in the [[University of Bonn]] to read philosophy, art history, literature, psychology and psychiatry. He visited [[lunatic asylum|asylums]] and became fascinated with the art work of the mentally ill patients; he also started painting that year, producing sketches in the garden of the Br\u00fchl castle, and portraits of his sister and himself. In 1911 Ernst befriended [[August Macke]] and joined his ''Die Rheinischen Expressionisten'' group of artists, deciding to become an artist.\n\nIn 1912 he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Gauguin]] profoundly influenced him. His work was exhibited that year together with that of the Das Junge Rheinland group, at Galerie Feldman in Cologne, and then in several group exhibitions in 1913.<ref name=\"chrono285\" /> In his paintings of this period, Ernst adopted an ironic style that juxtaposed grotesque elements alongside [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[German Expressionism|Expressionist]] motifs.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn 1914 Ernst met [[Hans Arp]] in Cologne. The two became friends and their relationship lasted for fifty years. After Ernst completed his studies in the summer, his life was interrupted by [[World War I]]. Ernst was drafted and served both on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Fronts]]. The effect of the war on Ernst was devastating; in his autobiography, he wrote of his time in the army thus: \"On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918\".<ref>Spies, Rewald 2005, xiv.</ref> For a brief period on the Western Front, Ernst was assigned to chart maps, which allowed him to continue painting.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> Several [[German Expressionist]] painters died in action during the war, among them [[August Macke]] and [[Franz Marc]].\n\n===Dada and surrealism===\n[[File:Ubu Imperator.jpg|thumb|right|Max Ernst, ''[[Ubu Roi|Ubu Imperator]]'', 1923, [[Musee National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]\nIn 1918, Ernst was demobilised and returned to Cologne. He soon married art history student [[Luise Straus-Ernst|Luise Straus]], whom he had met in 1914. In 1919, Ernst visited [[Paul Klee]] in Munich and studied paintings by [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. The same year, inspired by de Chirico and mail-order catalogues, teaching-aide manuals and similar sources, he produced his first [[collage]]s (notably ''Fiat modes'', a portfolio of [[lithograph]]s), a technique which would dominate his artistic pursuits. Also in 1919 Ernst, social activist [[Johannes Theodor Baargeld]] and several colleagues founded the Cologne [[Dada]] group. In 1919\u201320 Ernst and Baargeld published various short-lived magazines such as ''Der Strom'', ''die Schammade'' and organised Dada exhibitions.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\nErnst and Luise's son [[Jimmy Ernst|Ulrich 'Jimmy' Ernst]] was born on 24 June 1920; he also became a painter.<ref name=\"chrono285\" /> Ernst's marriage to Luise was short-lived. In 1921 he met [[Paul \u00c9luard]], who became a lifelong friend. \u00c9luard bought two of Ernst's paintings (''Celebes'' and ''Oedipus Rex'') and selected six collages to illustrate his poetry collection ''R\u00e9p\u00e9titions''. A year later the two collaborated on ''Les malheurs des immortels'' and then with [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]], whom Ernst met in 1921, on the magazine ''[[Litt\u00e9rature (magazine)|Litt\u00e9rature]]''. In 1922, unable to secure the necessary papers, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a [[m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] with \u00c9luard and his wife [[Gala Dal\u00ed|Gala]] in Paris suburb Saint-Brice, leaving behind his wife and son.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> During his first two years in Paris, Ernst took various odd jobs to make a living and continued to paint. In 1923 the \u00c9luards moved to a new home in [[Eaubonne]], near Paris, where Ernst painted numerous [[mural]]s. The same year his works were exhibited at ''Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants''.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\n[[File:Les Fusains.jpg|thumb|left|180px|\"Les Fusains\": 22, rue Tourlaque, [[18th arrondissement of Paris]] where Max Ernst established a studio in 1925]]\nAlthough apparently accepting the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, \u00c9luard eventually became more concerned about the affair. In 1924 he abruptly left, first for [[Monaco]] and then for [[Saigon]].<ref>Warlick, M.E. 2001. ''Max Ernst and Alchemy: a Magician in Search of Myth'', p. 83. {{ISBN|978-0-292-79136-7}}</ref> He soon asked his wife and Max Ernst to join him; both had to sell paintings to finance the trip. Ernst went to D\u00fcsseldorf and sold a large number of his works to a long-time friend, [[Johanna Ey]], owner of gallery ''Das Junge Rheinland''.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/> After a brief time together in Saigon, the trio decided that Gala would remain with Paul. The \u00c9luards returned to Eaubonne in early September, while Ernst followed them some months later, after exploring more of South-East Asia. He returned to Paris in late 1924 and soon signed a contract with Jacques Viot that allowed him to paint full-time. In 1925 Ernst established a studio at 22, rue Tourlaque.<ref name=\"chrono285\"/>\n\nIn 1925, Ernst invented a graphic art technique called [[frottage (surrealist technique)|frottage]] (see [[Surrealist techniques]]), which uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 128.</ref> He also created the '[[grattage]]' technique, in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He used this technique in his famous painting ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (as shown at the Tate Modern). The next year he collaborated with [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] on designs for [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. With Mir\u00f3's help, Ernst developed grattage, in which he trowelled pigment from his canvases. He also explored with the technique of [[decalcomania]], which involves pressing paint between two surfaces.<ref>Max Ernst working in decalcomania is shown in the 1978 documentary on the Dada and Surrealist art movement, ''Europe After the Rain''.</ref> Earst was also active, along with fellow Surrealists, at the [[Atelier 17]].<ref name=\"Swann Galleries\">{{cite web |title=Atelier 17: Europe and the Early Years |url=https://www.swanngalleries.com/news/19th-20th-century-prints-drawings/2011/10/atelier-17-europe-early-years/ |website=Swann Galleries News |accessdate=20 February 2020 |date=10 October 2011}}</ref> \n\nErnst developed a fascination with birds that was prevalent in his work. His alter ego in paintings, which he called [[Loplop]], was a bird. He suggested that this alter-ego was an extension of himself stemming from an early confusion of birds and humans.<ref>Spies et al. 1991, p. 285.</ref> He said that one night when he was young, he woke up and found that his beloved bird had died; a few minutes later, his father announced that his sister was born. Loplop often appeared in collages of other artists' work, such as ''Loplop presents Andr\u00e9 Breton''. Ernst drew a great deal of controversy with his 1926 painting ''The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: Andr\u00e9 Breton, Paul \u00c9luard, and the Painter''.<ref>Image: [http://www.metmuseum.org/special/Max_Ernst/view_1.asp?item=4&view=l The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist]</ref> In 1927, Ernst married {{Ill|Marie-Berthe Aurenche|de}} and it is thought his relationship with her may have inspired the erotic subject matter of ''The Kiss'' and other works of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Flint|first=Lucy, Guggenheim Collection|title=''The Kiss (Le Baiser)''|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706214957/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/search/?q=76.2553.71|archivedate=6 July 2015}}</ref> Ernst appeared in the 1930 film ''[[L'\u00c2ge d'Or]]'', directed by the [[Surrealist]] [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]. Ernst began to sculpt in 1934 and spent time with [[Alberto Giacometti]]. In 1938, the American heiress and artistic [[patron]] [[Peggy Guggenheim]] acquired a number of Max Ernst's works, which she displayed in her new gallery in London. Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim were married from 1942 to 1946.\n\n===World War II and later life===\n[[File:L'Ange du Foyeur.jpg|thumb|''L'Ange du Foyer'', 1937]]\nIn September 1939, the outbreak of [[World War II]] caused Ernst to be interned as an \"undesirable foreigner\" in [[Camp des Milles]], near [[Aix-en-Provence]], along with fellow surrealist, [[Hans Bellmer]], who had recently emigrated to Paris. He had been living with his lover and fellow surrealist painter, [[Leonora Carrington]] who, not knowing whether he would return, saw no option but to sell their house to repay their debts and leave for Spain. Thanks to the intercession of [[Paul \u00c9luard]] and other friends, including the journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was released a few weeks later. Soon after the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]], he was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]] but managed to escape and flee to America with the help of [[Peggy Guggenheim]] and Fry.<ref name=abc>{{Cite web|last=Olga's Gallery|title=Max Ernst biography|url=http://www.abcgallery.com/E/ernst/ernstbio.html}}</ref> Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim arrived in the United States in 1941 and were married at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Iyengar|first1=Rishi|title=New Google Doodle Honors Surrealist Painter Leonora Carrington|url=http://time.com/3771801/google-doodle-leonora-carrington-surrealist-painter/|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=Time|date=6 April 2015}}</ref> Along with other artists and friends ([[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Marc Chagall]]) who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of [[Abstract expressionism]].\n\nHis marriage to Guggenheim did not last and in [[Beverly Hills, California]] in October 1946, in a double ceremony with [[Man Ray]] and Juliet P. Browner, he married [[Dorothea Tanning]].<ref name=\"Juliet's obituary\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 January 1991 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}</ref> The couple made their home in [[Sedona, Arizona]] from 1946 to 1953, where the high desert landscapes inspired them and recalled Ernst's earlier imagery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waldman|first1=Diane|title=Max Ernst : A Retrospective|date=1975|publisher=Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|location=New York, NY}}</ref> Despite the fact that Sedona was remote and populated by fewer than 400 ranchers, orchard workers, merchants and small Native American communities, their presence helped begin what would become an American [[artists' colony]]. Among the monumental red rocks, Ernst built a small cottage by hand on Brewer Road and he and Tanning hosted intellectuals and European artists such as [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] and [[Yves Tanguy]]. Sedona proved an inspiration for the artists and for Ernst, who compiled his book ''Beyond Painting'' and completed his sculptural masterpiece ''Capricorn'' while living there. As a result of the book and its publicity, Ernst began to achieve financial success. From the 1950s he lived mainly in France. In 1954 he was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/max-ernst-1065 | work = Tate Etc. | title = Max Ernst 1891\u20131976}}</ref> He died at the age of 84 on 1 April 1976 in Paris and was interred at [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]].<ref name=abc/>\n\n==Selected works==\n\n===Paintings===\n\n====Early works====\n[[File:Houghton Typ 915.22.3605 R\u00e9p\u00e9titions, 1922 - cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''R\u00e9p\u00e9titions'', with illustrations by Max Ernst]]\n* ''[[Aquis Submersus]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Trophy, Hypertrophied]]'' (1919)\n* ''[[Little Machine Constructed by Minimax Dadamax in Person]]'' (1919\u20131920)\n* ''[[Murdering Airplane]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Hat Makes the Man]]'' (1920)\n* ''[[The Elephant Celebes|Celebes]]'' (1921)\n* ''Oedipus Rex'' (1922)\n\n====First French period====\n[[File:Max morise, max ernst e andr\u00e9 masson, cadaveri eccellenti (cadavre exquis), 1927.jpg|thumb|right|Collective surrealist artwork ''Cadavre exquis'', made by Max Ernst, [[Max Morise]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]] in 1927]]\n* ''[[Piet\u00e0 or Revolution by Night]]'' (1923)\n* ''Saint Cecilia'' (1923)\n* ''The Wavering Woman'' (1923)\n* ''Ubu Imperator'' (1923)\n* ''[[Of This Men Shall Know Nothing]]'' (1923)\n* ''Two Children Are Threatened by a Nightingale'' (1924)\n* ''Woman, Old Man and Flower'' (1924)\n* ''Paris Dream'' (1924\u201325)\n* ''The Blessed Virgin Chastises the Infant Jesus Before Three Witnesses: A.B., P.E. and the Artist'' (1926)\n* ''Forest'' series, e.g. ''[[Forest and Dove]]'' (1927), ''[[The Wood (Max Ernst)|The Wood]]'' (1927)\n* ''Rendezvous of Friends \u2013 The Friends Become Flowers'' (1928)\n* ''[[Loplop]]'' series, e.g. ''Loplop Introduces Loplop'' (1930), ''Loplop Introduces a Young Girl'' (1930)\n* ''City'' series, e.g. ''Petrified City'' (1933), ''Entire City'' (1935\u201336, two versions)\n* ''Garden Aeroplane Trap'' series (1935\u201336)\n* ''The Joy of Living'' (1936)\n* ''The Nymph Echo'' (1936)\n* ''The Fireside Angel'' (1937)\n* ''[[The Barbarians (painting)|The Barbarians]]'' (1937)\n* ''The Fascinating Cypress'' (1940)\n* ''The Robing of the Bride'' (1940)\n\n====American period====\n* ''Totem and Taboo'' (1941)\n* ''Marlene'' (1941)\n* ''[[Napoleon in the Wilderness]]'' (1941)\n* ''Day and Night'' (1941\u201342)\n* ''The Antipope '' (1942)\n* ''Europe After the Rain II'' (1940\u201342)\n* ''Surrealism and Painting'' (1942)\n* ''Vox Angelica'' (1943)\n* ''Everyone Here Speaks Latin'' (1943)\n* ''Painting for Young People'' (1943)\n* ''[[The Eye of Silence]]'' (1944)\n* ''Dream and Revolution'' (1945)\n* ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Ernst painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (1945)\n* ''The Phases of the Night'' (1946)\n* ''Design in Nature'' (1947)\n* ''A beautiful day'' (1948), featured in the [[Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art | ''Painting toward architecture'' exhibition]] (1947-52)<ref>(March 15, 2019).

The connection opened on September 9, 1991. The project cost $16 million.<ref>{{Cite news    | last = Hanley   | first = Robert   | coauthors =    | title = Hoboken-Newark Rail Link Opens as Part of Multimillion-Dollar Expansion   | newspaper = New York Times   | location =   | pages =    | language =    | publisher =    | date = September 10, 1991   | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D81731F933A2575AC0A967958260&scp=2&sq=Waterfront%20Connection%20New%20Jersey%20Transit&st=cse   | accessdate = February 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe connection consists of a single track that splits from the [[Northeast Corridor]] main line to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]] as it rises to go over the main Hoboken Division line to Hoboken. The connection rises to the east with a bridge over [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]]'s westbound track and a [[Conrail]] freight line, merging into the Hoboken line from the south.  The red through-girder bridge [http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&cp=qsqj7j8tpggq&scene=55352653&lvl=2&sty=b here] was built for it; for its first 10+ years it was not electrified.  The Waterfront Connection lies immediately south of the [[Kearny Connection]], and serves the complementary purpose.  The two connections allow any trains originating from the west of Kearny, regardless of line, to terminate at either [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]].\n\nMost revenue trains which travel over the Connection originate on the [[North Jersey Coast Line]], with five rush hour trains in each direction originating/terminating at Hoboken.  One morning train from the [[Raritan Valley Line]] also uses the connection to reach Hoboken. The Waterfront Connection allows diesel trains to operate direct from Hoboken to Bay Head, the last stop on the North Jersey Coast Line. Since the North Jersey Coast Line's electrification ends at Long Branch, rush hour passengers south of Long Branch can take diesel trains all the way to Hoboken or change at [[Newark Penn Station]] for service to New York City. As of 2015, the [[ALP-45DP]] has allowed the introduction of one-seat rides from New York Penn Station all the way to Bay Head.\n\nWith the advent of the Waterfront Connection, NJ Transit no longer needed a separate fueling facility on the diesel portion of the North Jersey Coast Line since diesel engines can make the trip directly to Hoboken. Faced with large opposition from [[Bay Head]] residents in 2002, the Bay Head fueling facility was shut down and trains now refuel exclusively at Hoboken or at Raritan Yard.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824090918/http://www.newjersey.sierraclub.org/groupreports/jssep02.asp New Jersey Chapter - Sierra Club]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{New Jersey Transit Rail}}\n\n[[Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{update|date=July 2018}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}\n{{Coord|40.7435|-74.1267|name=Waterfront Connection (NJT)|display=title}}\n{{NJ Transit Newark/Hoboken Division approaches}}\nThe '''Waterfront Connection''' allows trains from [[NJ Transit]]'s [[Newark Division]] to switch from the former PRR main line to the former DL&W main line to [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]]. The connection opened on September 9, 1991. The project cost $16 million.<ref>{{Cite news    | last = Hanley   | first = Robert   | coauthors =    | title = Hoboken-Newark Rail Link Opens as Part of Multimillion-Dollar Expansion   | newspaper = New York Times   | location =   | pages =    | language =    | publisher =    | date = September 10, 1991   | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D81731F933A2575AC0A967958260&scp=2&sq=Waterfront%20Connection%20New%20Jersey%20Transit&st=cse   | accessdate = February 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe connection consists of a single track that splits from the [[Northeast Corridor]] main line to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]] as it rises to go over the main Hoboken Division line to Hoboken. The connection rises to the east with a bridge over [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]]'s westbound track and a [[Conrail]] freight line, merging into the Hoboken line from the south.  The red through-girder bridge [http://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&cp=qsqj7j8tpggq&scene=55352653&lvl=2&sty=b here] was built for it; for its first 10+ years it was not electrified.  The Waterfront Connection lies immediately south of the [[Kearny Connection]], and serves the complementary purpose.  The two connections allow any trains originating from the west of Kearny, regardless of line, to terminate at either [[Hoboken Terminal|Hoboken]] or [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|New York Penn Station]].\n\nMost revenue trains which travel over the Connection originate on the [[North Jersey Coast Line]], with five rush hour trains in each direction originating/terminating at Hoboken.  One morning train from the [[Raritan Valley Line]] also uses the connection to reach Hoboken. The Waterfront Connection allows diesel trains to operate direct from Hoboken to Bay Head, the last stop on the North Jersey Coast Line.
