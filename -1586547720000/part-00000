The film was released [[direct-to-video]] in October 1995.\n\n==Plot==\nJennifer ([[Alicia Silverstone]]) is a beautiful teenager who is hired to babysit the children of Harry Tucker ([[J. T. Walsh]]) and his wife, Dolly Tucker ([[Lee Garlington]]), while they attend a party hosted by their friends, Bill Holsten ([[George Segal]]) and his wife, Bernice Holsten ([[Lois Chiles]]). Harry often fantasizes about Jennifer, while Dolly misinterprets Bill's compliments as a sign of attraction and fantasizes about him. Meanwhile, Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Jack ([[Jeremy London]]), whom she broke up with after he began pressuring her for sex, runs into his estranged troublemaking friend Mark ([[Nicky Katt]]), Bill and Bernice's son, who once had a fling with Jennifer and still harbors feelings for her. Throughout the night, Harry, Jack and Mark have increasingly racy fantasies about Jennifer.\n\nJack calls Jennifer and asks to visit her at the Tuckers' residence, but she refuses. Mark later steals beer from Bill's party, where they run into Harry, who becomes fixated on the notion Jack might go to his house to have sex with Jennifer. Jack and Mark get increasingly drunk and show up uninvited to see Jennifer, but she refuses to let them in. They then spend the rest of the night stalking around the house and spying on her through the window. Meanwhile, Harry gets drunk and falls asleep in his car, where he has a nightmare of Jennifer and Jack having sex, which drives him to rush home and confront them. In his absence, Dolly makes a pass at Bill, who rejects her, but agrees to keep her secret and offers to drive her home.\n\nAt the Tuckers' residence, Jack and Mark force their way in while Jennifer is taking a bath and, after a tense argument, Mark knocks Jack unconscious and attempts to rape Jennifer, who runs out of the house. Mark pursues her and ends up being fatally run over by Harry, who is arrested for drunk driving just as Bill and Dolly arrive and hear about the accident. Before being escorted home, Jennifer confronts Jack, who is being questioned by the police, and asks him, \"What were you thinking?\" before leaving an ashamed and guilt-stricken Jack behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeremy London]] as Jack\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Mark Holsten\n* [[J.

The film was released [[direct-to-video]] in October 1995.\n\n==Plot==\nJennifer ([[Alicia Silverstone]]) is a beautiful teenager who is hired to babysit the children of Harry Tucker ([[J. T. Walsh]]) and his wife, Dolly Tucker ([[Lee Garlington]]), while they attend a party hosted by their friends, Bill Holsten ([[George Segal]]) and his wife, Bernice Holsten ([[Lois Chiles]]). Harry often fantasizes about Jennifer, while Dolly misinterprets Bill's compliments as a sign of attraction and fantasizes about him. Meanwhile, Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Jack ([[Jeremy London]]), whom she broke up with after he began pressuring her for sex, runs into his estranged troublemaking friend Mark ([[Nicky Katt]]), Bill and Bernice's son, who once had a fling with Jennifer and still harbors feelings for her. Throughout the night, Harry, Jack and Mark have increasingly racy fantasies about Jennifer.\n\nJack calls Jennifer and asks to visit her at the Tuckers' residence, but she refuses. Mark later steals beer from Bill's party, where they run into Harry, who becomes fixated on the notion Jack might go to his house to have sex with Jennifer. Jack and Mark get increasingly drunk and show up uninvited to see Jennifer, but she refuses to let them in. They then spend the rest of the night stalking around the house and spying on her through the window. Meanwhile, Harry gets drunk and falls asleep in his car, where he has a nightmare of Jennifer and Jack having sex, which drives him to rush home and confront them. In his absence, Dolly makes a pass at Bill, who rejects her, but agrees to keep her secret and offers to drive her home.\n\nAt the Tuckers' residence, Jack and Mark force their way in while Jennifer is taking a bath and, after a tense argument, Mark knocks Jack unconscious and attempts to rape Jennifer, who runs out of the house. Mark pursues her and ends up being fatally run over by Harry, who is arrested for drunk driving just as Bill and Dolly arrive and hear about the accident. Before being escorted home, Jennifer confronts Jack, who is being questioned by the police, and asks him, \"What were you thinking?\" before leaving an ashamed and guilt-stricken Jack behind.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as Jennifer\n* [[Jeremy London]] as Jack\n* [[Nicky Katt]] as Mark Holsten\n* [[J.

Diseases for which contact tracing is commonly performed for include [[tuberculosis]], vaccine-preventable infections like [[measles]], sexually transmitted infections (including [[HIV]]), blood-borne infections, some serious bacterial infections, and novel infections (e.g. [[SARS-CoV]] and [[SARS-CoV-2]]).  \nThe goals of contact tracing are: \n\n* To interrupt ongoing transmission and reduce spread of an infection\n* To alert contacts to the possibility of infection and offer preventive counseling or prophylactic care\n* To offer diagnosis, counseling and treatment to already infected individuals\n* If the infection is treatable, to help prevent reinfection of the originally infected patient\n* To learn about the epidemiology of a disease in a particular population\n\nContact tracing has been a pillar of communicable disease control in public health for decades.

For sexually transmitted infections, sexual contacts of the index case are relevant, as well as any babies born to the index case. For blood-borne infections, blood transfusion recipients, contacts who shared a needle, and anyone else who could have been exposed to blood of the index case are relevant.

The first part, '''''Mesrine: Killer Instinct''''', was based on Mesrine's autobiographical book ''L'instinct de mort'', while the second part, '''''Mesrine: Public Enemy Number One''''', detailed Mesrine's criminal career. The film has earned comparisons to the American film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', and [[Vincent Cassel]] earned rave reviews for his portrayal of Mesrine.<ref>{{cite news |title=French 'Scarface' Mesrine finally hits US cinemas |publisher= France 24 |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100827-france-cinema-usa-film-vincent-cassel-mesrine-crime |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=France 24 |date=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes2010\">{{cite news |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Vincent Cassel in Biography of French Gangster |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/movies/27mesrine.html |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=26 August 2010 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian\">{{cite news |last1=Hussey |first1=Andrew |title=Killer, robber, master of disguise... and now the biggest movie star in France |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/12/jacques-mesrine-french-movie |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=11 July 2009 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Parts==\n\nThe film is divided into two parts, with various titles:\n#'''''Mesrine: L'instinct de mort''''' ([[French language|French]] for \"Mesrine: Instinct for Death\"); known in English as '''''Public Enemy Number One (Part One)''''', '''''Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct''''' and '''''Mesrine: Killer Instinct'''''\n#'''''Mesrine: L'ennemi public No 1''''' ([[French language|French]] for \"Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1\"); known in English as '''''Public Enemy Number One (Part Two)''''', '''''Mesrine: Part 2 - Public Enemy #1''''' and '''''Mesrine: Public Enemy Number One'''''\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Part 1===\n\nPart 1 depicts Mesrine's life from 1959 to 1972, beginning with his time as a member of the French Army during the [[Algerian War]], where he was forced to shoot and kill prisoners and bomb-makers. On his return to France, he moves into his parents' home, where he reunites with his mother and his father. After an argument about getting an honest job, he meets with his old childhood friend, Paul, who is wealthy now and drives a sports car. They soon get into robbery business with Paul's boss, Guido, and from him, he obtains a [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] as a loan. Later, Guido and Mesrine kill Ahmed, an Arab pimp who beat up Sarah (one of his girls and Mesrine's girlfriend), and bury him in the countryside and drive off.\n\nUsing Guido's status as a local crime boss as protection from their enemies, after committing some robberies, Paul and Mesrine briefly leave [[France]] for the [[Canary Islands]], where Mesrine meets and falls in love with Sofia, who moves to France with him, and they marry. However, although they have a daughter, and later two sons, Mesrine continues to be in the robbery business, causing him to get arrested and sent to prison in late 1960. He is released in 1962, and although tries to keep a steady job and be honest, he is fired over financial crisis, and dreams of easy money get him back into 'the business'. One night, Guido and Paul arrive and Mesrine prepares to leave with them, but Sofia yells at him and tells him that she will call the police, on which Mesrine snaps, slaps her, drags her across the stairs, and shoves a gun into her mouth and threatens her in front of Guido and Paul before departing. Later they divorce, leaving him custody of the children.\n\nIn 1966, Mesrine, now a gangster, goes into a bar. A woman named Jeanne Schneider comes on to him and the pair quickly fall in love. Jeanne is cut from the same cloth as Mesrine and the pair begin to commit robberies together. After stealing from a mob operated casino, the pair attract the attention of local mob bosses. In 1968, while walking with his young daughter, several men pull a 'drive-by' on Mesrine, wounding him. Guido treats him for his injuries, and suggests that he should leave the country until the things cool down, to which Mesrine agrees. He packs, leaves his kids in custody of his parents, and departs from France, traveling to [[Canada]] with Jeanne.\n\nLater, in [[Montreal]], he works as a construction worker on the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], where he meets a Quebec resident, Jean-Paul Mercier, and they become friends. Mesrine is denied residency in Canada due to his criminal past but he remains there illegally. He and Jeanne hatch a plan to kidnap and hold a French-Canadian billionaire, a decrepit man paralyzed from the waist down. They gain access to his home by taking the jobs of a maid and a chauffeur. After several months, they put their plan into practice, kidnapping the man and spiriting him away to a flat in the city. While Jeanne and Mesrine are away to try and collect the ransom money, the man manages to crawl to the balcony, break the glass, and call for help. The billionaire is taken away by paramedics just as Mesrine and Jeanne arrive back at their apartment. They flee, escaping across the border to the United States. They are subsequently captured in the [[Arizona]] desert, while at about the same time, Guido and Paul are murdered back in France by an unknown assailant.\n\nMesrine and Jeanne are sent back to Canada, where Jeanne is sentenced to five years, and Mesrine is sentenced to 10 years. He is sent to the [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] prison, where he is exposed to extreme torture and pain. Nevertheless, he still plans to break out of prison. After reuniting with Jean-Paul, also held in the same prison, he meets Roger Andr\u00e9, another prisoner, who helps him and Jean-Paul escape through the fence on a Monday, when the guards in the watch towers are hung over from the weekend. Soon after, they arrive near the border, where Jean-Paul meets Sylvie Jeanjacqout, and he falls in love with her. They hatch a plan to break Roger and friends out of prison, which does not go as intended. While Mesrine and Mercier are mounting the assault on the prison, they are both wounded. Roger is shot and killed.\n\nLater Mesrine manages to call Jeanne, to tell her he plans to break her out of prison, but, fearful for them both and wanting to abandon her old life of crime, with the prison weakening her, she severs her ties to him. Mesrine and Jean-Paul continue on with the robberies, and while having target practice in the woods one day, they are caught by two forest rangers, and forced to kill them and leave them. Mesrine says to Jean-Paul, \"If they catch us now, we'll hang.\"\n\nThe end credits roll. Notation concludes that Jeanne was released after serving her sentence, and went back to France to live freely, while Jean-Paul split with Mesrine and was shot dead a year later while robbing a bank. Mesrine's story is 'to be continued' (in part two).\n\n===Part 2===\n\nThe second film is about Mesrine's life from 1972 until 2 November 1979, the day of his death. The story starts back in 1972, with Mesrine returning to France after departing from Canada. He is now with Sylvie, who becomes his new girlfriend. He returns to [[Paris]] and commits more robberies. However, in March 1973, he is arrested after a successful heist, but as he is transferred to the courtroom, he requests to use the bathroom, and retrieves a pistol hidden in the toilet tank. He brandishes the gun in the court, forces the guards to uncuff him, and takes a judge hostage temporarily, while his apprentice, Michel, awaits, and the duo escapes. He returns to robberies with Michel, but his reckless behaviour (including robbing two banks at the same time) causes Michel to abandon Mesrine. After two months, French intelligence locates Mesrine's apartment, and Commissioner Broussard negotiates with Mesrine, who surrenders. He is brought to court and sentenced to 20 years in [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison]].\n\nDuring his time in prison, he reunites with his daughter, after 12 years of absence, and she is also present when he pleads his case in court. He then writes a book about his life, which angers his lawyer, who states that his biography places him in a difficult position, since he confesses to everything in public, but he rebuffs it. He also meets Fran\u00e7ois Besse, another convict and his solitary confinement neighbour, and hatches an escape plan; Besse smuggles pepper spray through a cookie box in prison (which can pass through the detectors since it's covered in aluminum foil), while Mesrine meets with his lawyer, who smuggles dual handguns in her briefcase. Mesrine informs the guard to bring his case file from Besse's cell and Besse attacks and subdues the guards with the spray, Mesrine then attacking them as well. They take their uniforms, take another prisoner as a cover and head over the wall, where the prisoner is shot while trying to escape with them. They manage to get away.\n\nAfter several other robberies, Mesrine fools the media, calling himself \"a revolutionary\", and professing to bring Palestinian armed forces to slay the French government. This angers Besse, and he leaves him. A year later, in 1979, Mesrine is living a wealthy life and buys himself a [[BMW New Class|1974 BMW]], and contacts his old friend from prison, Charlie Bauer, and they also start a series of robberies. Mesrine becomes more and more dillusioned with the media, secretly meeting with reporters and giving controversial interviews. He also kidnaps a local billionaire, Henri Leli\u00e8vre, and holds him for ransom, and then sets him free after being paid. Sylvie is more and more worried about Mesrine, and convinces him to leave the country. Meanwhile, Mesrine kidnaps Jacques Tillier (whose name is changed to Dallier in the movie), who wrote an article about him that he doesn't like, and makes him strip naked, then beats him and shoots him, presuming him dead. Mesrine finds out the next day that Tillier survived the ordeal.\n\nOn 2 November 1979, Mesrine and Sylvie leave their apartment disguised, with Sylvie taking her poodle, but Broussard's men are after them. After checking the area, Mesrine and Sylvie arrive at their car and drive off. Broussard is stuck in traffic and runs after them. At an intersection, a truck blocks Mesrine's way, and the back tarp is thrown open, revealing armed police gunmen, who immediately open fire and shoot him dead. Broussard arrives, and orders a hysterical and injured Sylvie and her dog to be taken away, and grimly looks at Mesrine's dead body.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Jacques Mesrine]]\n*[[Ludivine Sagnier]] as Sylvie Jeanjacquot\n*[[Michel Duchaussoy]] as Pierre Andr\u00e9 Mesrine (Mesrine's father)\n*[[Myriam Boyer]] as Mesrine's mother\n*[[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Guido\n\n===Part 1===\n*[[C\u00e9cile De France]] as Jeanne Schneider\n*[[Gilles Lellouche]] as Paul\n*[[Roy Dupuis]] as Jean-Paul Mercier\n*[[Elena Anaya]] as Sofia (Maria De La Soledad)\n*[[Florence Thomassin]] as Sarah\n*[[Abdelhafid Metalsi]]\t as Ahmed\n*[[Pascal Elso]] as Commissioner SRPJ\n*[[Deano Clavet]] as Roger Andr\u00e9\n*[[Gilbert Sicotte]] as the billionaire\n\n===Part 2===\n*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as Fran\u00e7ois Besse\n*[[G\u00e9rard Lanvin]] as Charlie Bauer\n*[[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Michel Ardouin\n*[[Olivier Gourmet]] as Commissioner Broussard\n*[[Anne Consigny]] as Mesrine's advocate\n*[[Georges Wilson]] as Henri Leli\u00e8vre\n*[[Fanny Sidney]] as Sabrina\n*[[Joseph Malerba]] as Robert\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor &ndash; Leading Role (Vincent Cassel)\n**'''Won''': Best Director (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n**'''Won''': Best Sound (Herv\u00e9 Buirette, Fran\u00e7ois Groult, G\u00e9rard Hardy, Jean Minondo, Lo\u00efc Prian and Alexandre Widmer) \n**Nominated: Best Cinematography (Robert Gantz)\n**Nominated: Best Costume Design (Virginie Montel)\n**Nominated: Best Editing (Bill Pankow and Herv\u00e9 Schneid)\n**Nominated: Best Film\n**Nominated: Best Music Written for a Film (Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp)\n**Nominated: Best Production Design (Emile Ghigo)\n**Nominated: Best Writing  &ndash; Adaptation (Abdel Raouf Dafri and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n*'''[[Tokyo International Film Festival]]''' (Japan)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor (Vincent Cassel)\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe critic aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] certified the movie \"fresh\" with both parts having 84% of critics favourable.

On his return to France, he moves into his parents' home, where he reunites with his mother and his father. After an argument about getting an honest job, he meets with his old childhood friend, Paul, who is wealthy now and drives a sports car. They soon get into robbery business with Paul's boss, Guido, and from him, he obtains a [[Citro\u00ebn DS]] as a loan. Later, Guido and Mesrine kill Ahmed, an Arab pimp who beat up Sarah (one of his girls and Mesrine's girlfriend), and bury him in the countryside and drive off.\n\nUsing Guido's status as a local crime boss as protection from their enemies, after committing some robberies, Paul and Mesrine briefly leave [[France]] for the [[Canary Islands]], where Mesrine meets and falls in love with Sofia, who moves to France with him, and they marry. However, although they have a daughter, and later two sons, Mesrine continues to be in the robbery business, causing him to get arrested and sent to prison in late 1960. He is released in 1962, and although tries to keep a steady job and be honest, he is fired over financial crisis, and dreams of easy money get him back into 'the business'. One night, Guido and Paul arrive and Mesrine prepares to leave with them, but Sofia yells at him and tells him that she will call the police, on which Mesrine snaps, slaps her, drags her across the stairs, and shoves a gun into her mouth and threatens her in front of Guido and Paul before departing. Later they divorce, leaving him custody of the children.\n\nIn 1966, Mesrine, now a gangster, goes into a bar. A woman named Jeanne Schneider comes on to him and the pair quickly fall in love. Jeanne is cut from the same cloth as Mesrine and the pair begin to commit robberies together. After stealing from a mob operated casino, the pair attract the attention of local mob bosses. In 1968, while walking with his young daughter, several men pull a 'drive-by' on Mesrine, wounding him. Guido treats him for his injuries, and suggests that he should leave the country until the things cool down, to which Mesrine agrees. He packs, leaves his kids in custody of his parents, and departs from France, traveling to [[Canada]] with Jeanne.\n\nLater, in [[Montreal]], he works as a construction worker on the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], where he meets a Quebec resident, Jean-Paul Mercier, and they become friends. Mesrine is denied residency in Canada due to his criminal past but he remains there illegally. He and Jeanne hatch a plan to kidnap and hold a French-Canadian billionaire, a decrepit man paralyzed from the waist down. They gain access to his home by taking the jobs of a maid and a chauffeur. After several months, they put their plan into practice, kidnapping the man and spiriting him away to a flat in the city. While Jeanne and Mesrine are away to try and collect the ransom money, the man manages to crawl to the balcony, break the glass, and call for help. The billionaire is taken away by paramedics just as Mesrine and Jeanne arrive back at their apartment. They flee, escaping across the border to the United States. They are subsequently captured in the [[Arizona]] desert, while at about the same time, Guido and Paul are murdered back in France by an unknown assailant.\n\nMesrine and Jeanne are sent back to Canada, where Jeanne is sentenced to five years, and Mesrine is sentenced to 10 years. He is sent to the [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec|Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] prison, where he is exposed to extreme torture and pain. Nevertheless, he still plans to break out of prison. After reuniting with Jean-Paul, also held in the same prison, he meets Roger Andr\u00e9, another prisoner, who helps him and Jean-Paul escape through the fence on a Monday, when the guards in the watch towers are hung over from the weekend. Soon after, they arrive near the border, where Jean-Paul meets Sylvie Jeanjacqout, and he falls in love with her. They hatch a plan to break Roger and friends out of prison, which does not go as intended. While Mesrine and Mercier are mounting the assault on the prison, they are both wounded. Roger is shot and killed.\n\nLater Mesrine manages to call Jeanne, to tell her he plans to break her out of prison, but, fearful for them both and wanting to abandon her old life of crime, with the prison weakening her, she severs her ties to him. Mesrine and Jean-Paul continue on with the robberies, and while having target practice in the woods one day, they are caught by two forest rangers, and forced to kill them and leave them. Mesrine says to Jean-Paul, \"If they catch us now, we'll hang.\"\n\nThe end credits roll. Notation concludes that Jeanne was released after serving her sentence, and went back to France to live freely, while Jean-Paul split with Mesrine and was shot dead a year later while robbing a bank. Mesrine's story is 'to be continued' (in part two).\n\n===Part 2===\n\nThe second film is about Mesrine's life from 1972 until 2 November 1979, the day of his death. The story starts back in 1972, with Mesrine returning to France after departing from Canada. He is now with Sylvie, who becomes his new girlfriend. He returns to [[Paris]] and commits more robberies. However, in March 1973, he is arrested after a successful heist, but as he is transferred to the courtroom, he requests to use the bathroom, and retrieves a pistol hidden in the toilet tank. He brandishes the gun in the court, forces the guards to uncuff him, and takes a judge hostage temporarily, while his apprentice, Michel, awaits, and the duo escapes. He returns to robberies with Michel, but his reckless behaviour (including robbing two banks at the same time) causes Michel to abandon Mesrine. After two months, French intelligence locates Mesrine's apartment, and Commissioner Broussard negotiates with Mesrine, who surrenders. He is brought to court and sentenced to 20 years in [[La Sant\u00e9 Prison]].\n\nDuring his time in prison, he reunites with his daughter, after 12 years of absence, and she is also present when he pleads his case in court. He then writes a book about his life, which angers his lawyer, who states that his biography places him in a difficult position, since he confesses to everything in public, but he rebuffs it. He also meets Fran\u00e7ois Besse, another convict and his solitary confinement neighbour, and hatches an escape plan; Besse smuggles pepper spray through a cookie box in prison (which can pass through the detectors since it's covered in aluminum foil), while Mesrine meets with his lawyer, who smuggles dual handguns in her briefcase. Mesrine informs the guard to bring his case file from Besse's cell and Besse attacks and subdues the guards with the spray, Mesrine then attacking them as well. They take their uniforms, take another prisoner as a cover and head over the wall, where the prisoner is shot while trying to escape with them. They manage to get away.\n\nAfter several other robberies, Mesrine fools the media, calling himself \"a revolutionary\", and professing to bring Palestinian armed forces to slay the French government. This angers Besse, and he leaves him. A year later, in 1979, Mesrine is living a wealthy life and buys himself a [[BMW New Class|1974 BMW]], and contacts his old friend from prison, Charlie Bauer, and they also start a series of robberies. Mesrine becomes more and more dillusioned with the media, secretly meeting with reporters and giving controversial interviews. He also kidnaps a local billionaire, Henri Leli\u00e8vre, and holds him for ransom, and then sets him free after being paid. Sylvie is more and more worried about Mesrine, and convinces him to leave the country. Meanwhile, Mesrine kidnaps Jacques Tillier (whose name is changed to Dallier in the movie), who wrote an article about him that he doesn't like, and makes him strip naked, then beats him and shoots him, presuming him dead. Mesrine finds out the next day that Tillier survived the ordeal.\n\nOn 2 November 1979, Mesrine and Sylvie leave their apartment disguised, with Sylvie taking her poodle, but Broussard's men are after them. After checking the area, Mesrine and Sylvie arrive at their car and drive off. Broussard is stuck in traffic and runs after them. At an intersection, a truck blocks Mesrine's way, and the back tarp is thrown open, revealing armed police gunmen, who immediately open fire and shoot him dead. Broussard arrives, and orders a hysterical and injured Sylvie and her dog to be taken away, and grimly looks at Mesrine's dead body.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*[[Vincent Cassel]] as [[Jacques Mesrine]]\n*[[Ludivine Sagnier]] as Sylvie Jeanjacquot\n*[[Michel Duchaussoy]] as Pierre Andr\u00e9 Mesrine (Mesrine's father)\n*[[Myriam Boyer]] as Mesrine's mother\n*[[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as Guido\n\n===Part 1===\n*[[C\u00e9cile De France]] as Jeanne Schneider\n*[[Gilles Lellouche]] as Paul\n*[[Roy Dupuis]] as Jean-Paul Mercier\n*[[Elena Anaya]] as Sofia (Maria De La Soledad)\n*[[Florence Thomassin]] as Sarah\n*[[Abdelhafid Metalsi]]\t as Ahmed\n*[[Pascal Elso]] as Commissioner SRPJ\n*[[Deano Clavet]] as Roger Andr\u00e9\n*[[Gilbert Sicotte]] as the billionaire\n\n===Part 2===\n*[[Mathieu Amalric]] as Fran\u00e7ois Besse\n*[[G\u00e9rard Lanvin]] as Charlie Bauer\n*[[Samuel Le Bihan]] as Michel Ardouin\n*[[Olivier Gourmet]] as Commissioner Broussard\n*[[Anne Consigny]] as Mesrine's advocate\n*[[Georges Wilson]] as Henri Leli\u00e8vre\n*[[Fanny Sidney]] as Sabrina\n*[[Joseph Malerba]] as Robert\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Part 1 and 2===\n*'''[[C\u00e9sar Awards]]''' (France)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor &ndash; Leading Role (Vincent Cassel)\n**'''Won''': Best Director (Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n**'''Won''': Best Sound (Herv\u00e9 Buirette, Fran\u00e7ois Groult, G\u00e9rard Hardy, Jean Minondo, Lo\u00efc Prian and Alexandre Widmer) \n**Nominated: Best Cinematography (Robert Gantz)\n**Nominated: Best Costume Design (Virginie Montel)\n**Nominated: Best Editing (Bill Pankow and Herv\u00e9 Schneid)\n**Nominated: Best Film\n**Nominated: Best Music Written for a Film (Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp)\n**Nominated: Best Production Design (Emile Ghigo)\n**Nominated: Best Writing  &ndash; Adaptation (Abdel Raouf Dafri and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet)\n*'''[[Tokyo International Film Festival]]''' (Japan)\n**'''Won''': Best Actor (Vincent Cassel)\n\n==Reception==\n\nThe critic aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] certified the movie \"fresh\" with both parts having 84% of critics favourable.

A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance\".<ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J. (2000). [http://www.smu.edu/totw/nct.htm \"Non-Chord Tones\"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095155/http://www.smu.edu/TOTW/nct.htm |date=2007-07-03 }}, ''Theory on the Web'', Southern Methodist University.</ref>\n\n[[File:pedalpoint.gif|thumb|center|400px|Pedal point example. {{audio|Pedalpoint.mid|Play}}]]\n\nPedal points \"have a strong tonal effect, 'pulling' the harmony back to its [[root (chord)|root]]\".<ref name=\"smu\" /> When a pedal point occurs in a [[voice (music)|voice]] other than the bass, it is usually referred to as an '''inverted pedal point'''<ref name=\"B&S\">Benward & Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.\u00a099. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.

A pedal point sometimes functions as a \"[[non-chord tone]]\", placing it in the categories alongside [[Suspension (music)|suspension]]s, [[Suspension (music)|retardation]]s, and [[passing tone]]s. However, the pedal point is unique among non-chord tones, \"in that it begins on a consonance, sustains (or [[repetition (music)|repeats]]) through another chord as a dissonance until the [[harmony]]\", not the non-chord tone, \"resolves back to a consonance.\" <ref name=\"smu\">Frank, Robert J. (2000).

''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.99. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.</ref> (see [[inversion (music)|inversion]]). Pedal points are usually on either the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] or the [[dominant (music)|dominant]] (fifth note of the [[scale (music)|scale]]) tones. The pedal tone is considered a chord tone in the original harmony, then a [[nonchord tone]] during the intervening dissonant harmonies, and then a chord tone again when the harmony resolves. A dissonant pedal point may go against all harmonies present during its duration, being almost more like an [[added tone]] than a nonchord tone, or pedal points may serve as atonal [[pitch center]]s.\n\nThe term comes from the [[organ (music)|organ]] for its ability to sustain a note indefinitely and the tendency for such notes to be played on an organ's [[pedal keyboard]]. The pedal keyboard on an organ is played by the feet; as such, the organist can hold down a pedal point for lengthy periods while both hands perform higher-register music on the manual keyboards.\n\n==Types==\nA '''double pedal''' is two pedal tones played simultaneously.\nAn '''inverted pedal''' is a pedal that is not in the bass (and often is the highest part.)  [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] included numerous inverted pedals in his works, particularly in the solo parts of his [[concerto]]s. An '''internal pedal''' is a pedal that is similar to the inverted pedal, except that it is played in the middle register between the bass and the upper voices.\n\nA [[drone (music)|drone]] differs from a pedal point in degree or quality. A pedal point may be a [[nonchord tone]] and thus required to [[Resolution (music)|resolve]], unlike a drone, or a pedal point may simply be a shorter drone, a drone being a longer pedal point.\n\n==Use in classical music==\n\nThere are numerous examples of pedal points in European classical music. Pedal points often appear in early baroque music \"alla battaglia\", notably prolonged in [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]'s ''Es steh Gott auf'' (SWV 356) and [[Claudio Monteverdi]]'s ''Altri canti di Marte''.<ref>Gerald Drebes: \"Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \u201eVollkommenheit der Musik\u201c \u2013 \u201eEs steh Gott auf\u201c aus den \u201eSymphoniae sacrae\u201c II (1647)\".

Often the pedal note is simply repeated at intervals.  A pedal tone can also be realized with a [[trill (music)|trill]]; this is particularly common with inverted pedals. Another method of producing a pedal point on the harpsichord is to repeat the pedal point note (or its octave) on every beat. The rarely seen [[harpsichord#Other|pedal harpsichord]], a harpsichord with a [[pedal keyboard]], makes it easier to perform repeated bass notes on the harpsichord, since both hands are still free to play on the upper manual keyboards.\n\nWith the development of the piano, composers began exploring the potential of a pedal-point in creating mood and atmosphere.  An example is the inverted pedal that pervades the right hand part of the piano accompaniment in [[Schubert]]\u2019s song [[Erlk\u00f6nig (Goethe)|''The Erl King'']]:[[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 01.wav|thumb|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]][[File:Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Schubert, Erl King, piano introduction]]\n\nAccording to Eugene Narmour (1987, p.&nbsp;101) \"There is no instrument on which a pedal point sounds better than the piano (with its ready-made damper mechanism), and, safe to say, no composer more fond of harmonic pedals than [[Chopin]].\"<ref>Narmour, E.

primarily for the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. A total of nine were built for the Royal Navy (RN); four Batch 1 and five of the significantly different Batch 2. One modified Batch 1 (HMS Clyde) has been decommissioned leaving eight vessels planned for RN service from 2020. The Batch 1 ships of the class replaced the seven ships of the {{sclass2-|Island|patrol vessel|4}} and the two {{sclass2-|Castle|patrol vessel|0}} patrol vessels. {{ship|HTMS|Krabi}} was the first of two ships adapting the River design for the [[Royal Thai Navy]] and built in Thailand. The three ships of the {{sclass-|Amazonas|corvette|1}} in service with the Brazilian Navy are also a variation of the River design.\n\n==Royal Navy==\n===Batch 1===\n====''Tyne'', ''Severn'' and ''Mersey''====\n\nIn early 2001, the Ministry of Defence placed an order with [[Vosper Thornycroft]] (VT) for three River-class offshore patrol vessels to replace the Island class.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\">{{cite book |last=Bush |first=Steve |title=British Warships and Auxiliaries |year=2014 |publisher=Maritime Books |pages=23\u201324 |isbn=1904459552}}</ref> It was understood that the higher availability rates of the River class (up to 300 days per year), would enable the three new ships to perform the duties of the five ships they replaced. The Royal Navy initially chartered (or leased) the ships under a five-year, \u00a360 million contract from the builder VT.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/> As part of the contract, VT would be responsible for all maintenance and support during the charter period. This contract was renewed in January 2007 for another five years at \u00a352 million.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/> However, in September 2012, instead of renewing the contract again, it was announced by the then Defence Secretary [[Philip Hammond]] that the Ministry of Defence had purchased the vessels for \u00a339 million.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/royal-navy-nets-cod-squad-patrol-ships-for-39m-1-4265277 |title=Royal Navy nets 'Cod Squad' patrol ships for \u00a339m |first=Michael |last=Powell |date=14 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]] |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe River class are significantly larger than the Island-class vessels and have a large open deck aft allowing them to be fitted with equipment for a specific role, which can include fire-fighting, disaster relief and anti-pollution work. For this purpose, a 25 tonne capacity [[crane (machine)|crane]] is fitted.

primarily for the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. A total of nine were built for the Royal Navy (RN); four Batch 1 and five of the significantly different Batch 2. One modified Batch 1 (HMS Clyde) has been decommissioned leaving eight vessels planned for RN service from 2020. The Batch 1 ships of the class replaced the seven ships of the {{sclass2-|Island|patrol vessel|4}} and the two {{sclass2-|Castle|patrol vessel|0}} patrol vessels. {{ship|HTMS|Krabi}} was the first of two ships adapting the River design for the [[Royal Thai Navy]] and built in Thailand. The three ships of the {{sclass-|Amazonas|corvette|1}} in service with the Brazilian Navy are also a variation of the River design.\n\n==Royal Navy==\n===Batch 1===\n====''Tyne'', ''Severn'' and ''Mersey''====\n\nIn early 2001, the Ministry of Defence placed an order with [[Vosper Thornycroft]] (VT) for three River-class offshore patrol vessels to replace the Island class.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\">{{cite book |last=Bush |first=Steve |title=British Warships and Auxiliaries |year=2014 |publisher=Maritime Books |pages=23\u201324 |isbn=1904459552}}</ref> It was understood that the higher availability rates of the River class (up to 300 days per year), would enable the three new ships to perform the duties of the five ships they replaced. The Royal Navy initially chartered (or leased) the ships under a five-year, \u00a360 million contract from the builder VT.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/> As part of the contract, VT would be responsible for all maintenance and support during the charter period. This contract was renewed in January 2007 for another five years at \u00a352 million.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/> However, in September 2012, instead of renewing the contract again, it was announced by the then Defence Secretary [[Philip Hammond]] that the Ministry of Defence had purchased the vessels for \u00a339 million.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/news/defence/royal-navy-nets-cod-squad-patrol-ships-for-39m-1-4265277 |title=Royal Navy nets 'Cod Squad' patrol ships for \u00a339m |first=Michael |last=Powell |date=14 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The News (Portsmouth)|The News]] |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe River class are significantly larger than the Island-class vessels and have a large open deck aft allowing them to be fitted with equipment for a specific role, which can include fire-fighting, disaster relief and anti-pollution work. For this purpose, a 25 tonne capacity [[crane (machine)|crane]] is fitted. In addition, the deck is strong enough for the transport of various tracked and wheeled light vehicles, or an [[LCVP (United Kingdom)|LCVP]].<ref>[https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/river_class/ Naval Technology - River Class]</ref> The class are primarily used with the [[Fishery Protection Squadron]] and [[Exclusive economic zone|EEZ]] patrol.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the running costs for the River class were estimated at \u00a320 million: \"''The average running cost... of [the] River class is \u00a320 million... These figures, based on the expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Defence in 2009\u201310, include maintenance, safety certification, military upgrades, manpower, inventory, satellite communication, fuel costs and depreciation.''\"<ref>{{cite hansard |title=Written Answers \u2013 Armed Forces: Combat Ships |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/101124w0001.htm |house=House of Lords |date=24 November 2010 |column=WA332 |speaker=[[John Astor, 3rd Baron Astor of Hever|Lord Astor of Hever]] |position=Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State For Defence}}</ref>\n\n====''Clyde''====\n[[File:HMS Clyde MOD 45158399.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Clyde'' exercising off the Falklands in 2014]]\nIn February 2005, the Ministry of Defence placed an order with VT for the charter of a fourth modified River-class offshore patrol vessel.<ref name=\"Steve Bush 2014\"/> This fourth ship, ''Clyde'', was constructed at [[Portsmouth]] Dockyard and replaced the two {{sclass2-|Castle|patrol vessel|2}}<nowiki/>s for duties around the [[South Atlantic]] and the [[Falkland Islands]].

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nKilsob is bounded on the north by [[Erraran]] and [[Bawnboy]] townlands, on the west by [[Newtown, Templeport|Newtown]], [[Lakefield, Templeport|Lakefield]] and [[Mullaghmore, Templeport]] townlands, on the south by [[Kildoagh]] townland and on the east by [[Muinaghan]] and [[Corrasmongan]] townlands. The town of Bawnboy is partly situate in the north part of the townland and was sometimes referred to as Kilsob in the past, rather than Bawnboy. Its chief geographical features are Bellaboy Lough (Irish = Loch B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Bu\u00ed = The Lake of the Entrance to the Yellow Ford), the Bawnboy River, a stone quarry and dug wells. Kilsob is traversed by the national secondary [[N87 road (Ireland)]], the L1037 road, minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 348 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nA subdivision of the townland is named Rossilk or Ruserk.\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Kilsobb''.<ref>National Archives Dublin [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 26 June 1615, King [[James VI and I]] granted, inter alia, ''four polls in Killsobb to Sir George Graeme and Sir Richard Graeme to form part of the Manor of Greame''. An Inquisition held at Cavan Town on 31 October 1627 found that ''Sir Richard Greames of Corrasmongan died on 7 November 1625 seized of, inter alia, four polls in Kilsob.
