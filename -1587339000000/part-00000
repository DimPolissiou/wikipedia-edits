The initial advantage tilted in Azerbaijan's favor. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet military doctrine for defending the Caucasus had outlined a strategy where Armenia would be a combat zone in the event that [[NATO]] member [[Turkey]] were to have invaded from the west. Thus, there were only three [[Division (military)|divisions]] stationed in the Armenian SSR and no [[airfields]], while Azerbaijan had a total of five divisions and five military airfields. Furthermore, Armenia had approximately 500 [[railroad cars]] of [[ammunition]] in comparison to Azerbaijan's 10,000.<ref name=\"Petrosian, David 2000\"/>\n\nAs MVD forces began pulling out, they bequeathed the Armenians and Azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored [[armor]]ed vehicles. The government forces initially sent by Gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of the Soviet Union and many had no wish to remain any longer. Most were poor, young [[conscript]]s and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side, some even trying to sell tanks and [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). The unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame Gorbachev's policies as the ultimate cause of the conflict.<ref name=\"timestepanakert\">\n{{cite news|last=Carney|first=James|title=Former Soviet Union Carnage in Karabakh|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 April 1992|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,975278,00.html|accessdate=13 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310121157/http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,975278,00.html|archive-date=10 March 2005|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref> The Azerbaijanis purchased a large quantity of these vehicles, as reported by the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan in November 1993, which reported it had acquired 286 tanks, 842 armored vehicles, and 386 [[artillery]] pieces during the power vacuum.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=199}} The emergence of [[black market]]s helped facilitate the import of Western weaponry.<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Smith|first = Hedrick|title = The New Russians|publisher=Harper Perennial|year = 1991|location = New York|pages = 344\u2013345|isbn = 0-380-71651-8 }}</ref>\n\nMost weaponry was Russian-made or came from the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries; some improvisation was made by both sides. Azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from [[Turkey]], Israel and numerous [[Arab]] countries.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> The [[Armenian Diaspora]] donated a significant amount of aid to Armenia through the course of the war and even managed to push for legislation in the [[United States Congress]] to pass a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] entitled Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act in response to Azerbaijan's blockade against Armenia, placing a complete ban on military aid from the United States to Azerbaijan in 1992.<ref>[[Section 907|Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act]]. Humanitarian aid was not explicitly banned but such supplies had to be routed through indirectly to aid organizations. On 25 January 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a waiver that effectively repealed Section 907, thereby removing any restrictions that were barring the United States from sending military aid to Azerbaijan; military parity is maintained toward both sides.

Azerbaijan continues to maintain their road and air blockade against Armenia.</ref> While Azerbaijan charged that the Russians were initially helping the Armenians, it was said that \"the Azerbaijani fighters in the region [were] far better equipped with Soviet military weaponry than their opponents.\"<ref name=\"timestepanakert\"/>\n\nWith Gorbachev resigning as Soviet General-Secretary on 26 December 1991, the remaining republics including [[Ukraine]], Belarus, and [[Russia]], declared their independence and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on 31 December 1991. This dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping Armenia and Azerbaijan from waging a full-scale war. One month prior, on 21 November, the Azerbaijani Parliament had rescinded Karabakh's status as an autonomous region and renamed its capital \"Xankandi\". In response, on 10 December, a referendum was held in Karabakh by parliamentary leaders (with the local Azerbaijani community boycotting it), whereby the Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. On 6 January 1992, the region declared its independence from Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Soviet interior forces from Nagorno-Karabakh in the Caucasus region was only temporary. By February 1992, the former Soviet states were consolidated as the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). While Azerbaijan abstained from joining, Armenia, fearing a possible invasion by Turkey in the escalating conflict, entered the CIS, which brought it under the organization's \"collective security umbrella\". In January 1992, CIS forces established their new headquarters at Stepanakert and took up a slightly more active role in peacekeeping, incorporating old units, including the 366th Motorized Rifle Regiment and elements of the [[Soviet Fourth Army|Soviet 4th Army]].<ref name=\"Karagiannis\"/>\n\n==Building armies==\n[[File:Armenian soldiers in northern Artsakh 1994.tif|thumb|Armenian soldiers in Karabakh, 1994, wearing Soviet Army combat helmets and wielding [[AK-74]] assault rifles]]\n[[File:Azerbaijani soldiers during Nagorno Karabagh war.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani soldiers during the war, 1992]]\nThe sporadic battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had intensified after Operation Ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia, a recurrent and popular theme at the time compared and idolized the separatist fighters to historical Armenian [[guerrilla]] groups and revered individuals such as [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], who fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=208}} In addition to the government's conscription of males aged 18\u201345, many Armenians volunteered to fight and formed ''jokats'', or detachments of about forty men, which, combined with several others, came under the command of a [[lieutenant colonel]]. Initially, many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf, rarely with any oversight, when attacking or defending areas.<ref name=\"brothersroad\" /> Direct insubordination was common as many of the men simply did not show up, looted the bodies of dead soldiers and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets.<ref name=\"brothersroad\" />\n\nMany women enlisted in the Nagorno-Karabakh military, taking part in the fighting as well as serving in auxiliary roles such as providing [[first-aid]] and evacuating wounded men from the battlefield.\n\nAzerbaijan's military functioned in much the same manner; it was better organized during the first years of the war. The Azerbaijani government also carried out conscription and many Azerbaijanis enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed. Azerbaijan's National Army consisted of roughly 30,000 men, as well as nearly 10,000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front. [[Suret Huseynov]], a wealthy Azerbaijani, also improvised by creating his own military brigade, the 709th of the Azerbaijani Army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division's arsenal.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=199}} [[Isgandar Hamidov]]'s ''bozqurt'' or [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] brigade also mobilized for action. The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its [[oil field]] assets on and near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name=\"Gurdelik\" />\n\nFormer troops of the Soviet Union also offered their services to either side. For example, one of the most prominent officers to serve on the Armenian side was former Soviet General [[Anatoly Zinevich]], who remained in Nagorno-Karabakh for five years (1992\u20131997) and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of the Armenian forces. By the end of war he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Republic of Artsakh armed forces.

This offensive is regarded as the only successful breakthrough by the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces|Azerbaijani Army]] and marks the peak of Azerbaraijani success in the entirety of the six-year-long conflict. It also marks the beginning of a new, more intense, phase of the war. Over 8,000 Azerbaijani troops and four additional [[battalion]]s, at least 90 tanks and 70 [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s, as well as [[Mi-24]] [[Attack helicopter|attack-helicopters]] were used in this operation.\n\nOn 12 June 1992, the Azerbaijani military launched a large-scale diversionary attack in the direction of the [[Askeran Region|Askeran region]] at the center of Nagorno-Karabakh. Two groups, numbering 4,000 men, attacked the positions to the north and south of Askeran.

This three-day offensive was code-named Operation ''Goranboy'' and commanded by [[Suret Huseynov]]. After fifteen hours of fierce fighting against Azerbaijani forces, the two Armenian detachments were forced to retreat. Azerbaijan managed to capture several dozen villages in the Goranboy region originally held by the Armenian forces, and the entire Armenian civilian population of this region fled.

While not completely shut off, material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/>\n\nExperiencing both food shortages and power shortages, after the shutting down of the [[Metsamor]] nuclear power plant, Armenia's economic outlook appeared bleak: in Georgia, a new bout of civil wars against separatists in Abkhazia and Ossetia began, and supply convoys were raided and the only oil pipeline leading from Russia to Armenia was repeatedly destroyed.

Its oil refineries were not generating at full capacity and production quotas fell well short of estimates. In 1965, the oil fields in Baku were producing 21.5&nbsp;million tons of oil annually; by 1988, that number had dropped down to almost 3.3&nbsp;million.

Azerbaijan's President Elchibey expressed optimism toward bringing an agreeable solution to the conflict with Armenia's Ter-Petrosyan.

Azerbaijan's military had grown more desperate, and defense minister Gaziev and Huseynov's brigade turned to Russian help, a move which ran against Elchibey's policies and were construed as insubordination. Political infighting and arguments about where to shift military units between the country's ministry of the interior [[Isgandar Hamidov]] and Gaziev led to the latter's resignation on 20 February.

With a population of about 60,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azerbaijani and [[Kurds]].{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=14}} In March 1993, the Armenian-held areas near the [[Sarsang reservoir]] in [[Martakert Region|Mardakert]] were reported to have been coming under attack by the Azerbaijanis. After successfully defending the Martuni region, Melkonian's fighters were tasked to move to capture the region of Kalbajar, where the incursions and artillery shelling were said to have been coming from.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/>\n\nScant military opposition by the Azerbaijanis allowed Melkonian's fighters to gain a foothold in the region and along the way capture several abandoned armored vehicles and tanks. At 2:45&nbsp;pm, on 2 April, Armenian forces from two directions advanced toward Kalbajar in an attack that struck Azerbaijani armor and troops entrenched near the Ganja-Kalbajar intersection. Azerbaijani forces were unable to halt the advances made by Armenian armor and were wiped out completely. The second attack toward Kalbajar also quickly overran the defenders. By 3 April, Armenian forces were in possession of Kalbajar.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> President Elchibey imposed a state of emergency for a period of two months and introduced universal conscription.\n\nOn 30 April, the [[United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council (UNSC)]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|Resolution 822]], co-sponsored by [[Turkey]] and [[Pakistan]], demanding the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Kalbajar.<ref name=\"UN\">\n[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm#822 United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 passed on 30 April 1993]  .

Frustrated with what he felt was Elchibey's incompetence and demoted from his rank of colonel, his brigade advanced in early June from its base in Ganje toward Baku with the explicit aim of unseating the president. Elchibey stepped down from office on 18 June and power was assumed by then parliamentary member [[Heydar Aliyev]].

The Armenian side made use of the political crisis in Baku, which had left the Karabakh front almost undefended by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> The following four months of political instability in Azerbaijan led to the loss of control over five districts, as well as the north of Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> Azerbaijani military forces were unable to put up much resistance in the face of Armenian advances and abandoned most of their positions without so much as putting up a fight.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> In late June, they were driven out from Martakert, losing their final foothold of the enclave. By July, Armenian forces were preparing to attack and capture the region of [[Agdam Rayon|Agdam]], another rayon that fell outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, claiming that they were attempting to widen a [[Security belt of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|barrier]] that would keep towns and villages and their positions out of the range of Azerbaijani artillery.<ref>The genuineness of the NKR's reasons for launching the 1993 summer offensives were called into question and it was postulated that Karabakh forces were wantonly seizing the territories surrounding the enclave. While many doubted the veracity of the claims, periodic fighting between the two sides in the region were reported to have taken place in the months before the offensives took place.</ref>\n\nOn 4 July artillery bombardment commenced against Agdam by Armenian forces, destroying many parts of the town. Soldiers, along with civilians, began to evacuate Agdam. Facing military collapse, Aliyev attempted to mediate with the [[de facto]] Karabakh government and Minsk Group officials. In mid-August, Armenians massed a force to take the Azerbaijani-held regions of [[Fuzuli District|Fizuli]] and [[Jabrayil|Jebrail]], south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper.\n\nIn light of the Armenians' advance into Azerbaijan, Turkey's prime minister [[Tansu \u00c7iller]], warned the Armenian government not to attack Nakhichevan and demanded that Armenians pull out of Azerbaijan's territories. Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September. Russian Federation forces in Armenia in turn countered their movements and thus warded off the possible Turkish participation in the conflict.<ref>During the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], one of the coup's leaders against Russian President Yeltsin, [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], was reported by the US and French intelligence agencies to preparing Russian troop withdrawals from Armenia if the coup succeeded. An estimated 23,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Armenia on the border with Turkey. \u00c7iller was reported by the agencies to be collaborating with Khasbulatov for him to give her tacit support in allowing possible military incursions by Turkey into Armenia under the pretext of pursuing [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] guerrillas, an act it had once followed up on earlier the same year in northern [[Iraq]]. Russian armed forces crushed the coup.</ref>\n\nBy early September, Azerbaijani forces were nearly in complete disarray. Many of the heavy weapons they had received and bought from the Russians had been taken out of action or abandoned during the battles. Since the June 1992 offensive, Armenian forces had captured dozens of tanks, light armor, and artillery from Azerbaijan. For example, according to Monte Melkonian in a television interview in March 1993, his forces in Martuni alone had captured or destroyed a total of 55 [[T-72]]s, 24 [[BMP-2]]s, 15 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and 25 pieces of heavy artillery since the June 1992 Goranboy offensive. \"Most of our arms,\" he stated, \"[were] captured from Azerbaijan.\"<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> [[Serzh Sargsyan]], the then military leader of the Karabakh armed forces, tallied a total of 156 tanks captured through the course of the war.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=316}} By mid-1993, Armenian forces had captured so much equipment that many of them were praising Elchibey, since he was, in effect, arming both sides.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/>\n\nFurther signs of Azerbaijan's desperation included the recruitment by Aliyev of 1,000\u20131,500 [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] and Arab [[mujahadeen]] fighters from [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Charalampidis|first=Ioannis|title=Sponsored To Kill: Mercenaries and Terrorist Networks in Azerbaijan|year=2013|publisher=\"MIA\" Publishers|location=Moscow|isbn=978-5-9986-0115-6|url=http://karabakhfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ioannis-Charalampidis-Sponsored-to-Kill-ENG.pdf|ref=harv|access-date=18 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129225618/http://karabakhfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ioannis-Charalampidis-Sponsored-to-Kill-ENG.pdf|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/international+terrorism/dt20-2008 Michael Taarnby \"The Mujahedin in Nagorno-Karabakh: A Case Study in the Evolution of Global Jihad\" (WP) 20/2008 \u2013 9/5/2008]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100252/http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Felcano%2Felcano_in%2Fzonas_in%2Finternational%20terrorism%2Fdt20-2008 |date=7 April 2014 }}</ref> Although the Azerbaijani government denied this claim, correspondence and photographs captured by Armenian forces indicated otherwise.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/> A United States-based petroleum company, [[MEGA OIL]], also hired several American military trainers as a prerequisite for Azerbaijan to grant it drilling rights at its oil fields.<ref name=\"Gurdelik\"/>\n\n==Aerial warfare==\n{{See also|Armenian Air Force|Azerbaijani Air Force|Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army#Air Force|1992 Azerbaijani Mil Mi-8 shootdown}}\nThe aerial warfare in Karabakh involved primarily [[fighter jets]] and attack helicopters.

The offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of Karabakh in the north and to the south but soon petered out. In response, the Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to stop the Azerbaijani advance in Karabakh.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=121}} To bolster the ranks of its army, the Armenian government issued a decree that instituted a three-month call-up for men up to age forty-five and resorted to press-gang raids to enlist recruits.

The two offensives that took place in the winter cost Azerbaijan as many as 5,000 lives (at the loss of several hundred Armenians).<ref name=\"Croissant\"/> The main Azerbaijani offensive was aimed at recapturing the Kalbajar district, which would thus threaten the Lachin corridor. The attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing the vital Omar Pass. As the Armenian forces reacted, the bloodiest clashes of the war ensued and the Azerbaijani forces were soundly defeated. In a single episode of that time's clashes, Azerbaijan lost about fifteen hundred of its soldiers after the failed offensive in Kalbajar.<ref>de Waal, Thomas. ''The Caucasus. An Introduction''.

Armenian-Russian journalist [[Dmitri Pisarenko]] who spent a year at the front line and filmed many of the battles later wrote that both Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists were preoccupied with echoing the official stands of their respective governments and that \"objectiveness was being sacrificed for ideology.\" Armenian military commanders were eager to give interviews following Azerbaijani offensives when they were able to criticise the other side for launching heavy artillery attacks that the \"small-numbered but proud Armenians\" had to fight off. Yet they were reluctant to speak out when Armenian troops seized a village outside Nagorno-Karabakh in order to avoid justifying such acts.

A study of the four largest Canadian newspapers covering the event showed that the journalists tended to present the massacre of Azeris as a secondary issue, as well as to rely on Armenian sources, to give priority to Armenian denials over Azerbaijani \"allegations\" (which were described as \"grossly exaggerated\"), to downplay the scale of death, not to publish images of the bodies and mourners, and not to mention the event in editorials and opinion columns.<ref name=\"karim\"/>\n\n==Post-ceasefire violence and mediation==\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains one of several frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union, alongside Georgia's breakaway regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], Moldova's troubles with [[Transnistria]], and [[Ukraine]]'s [[War in Donbass|war with Russian-backed separatists]] and the [[Occupation of Crimea|Russian occupation of Crimea]].

The demand to unify with Armenia began in a relatively peaceful manner in 1988; in the following months, as the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union disintegrated]], it gradually grew into an increasingly violent conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, resulting in [[ethnic cleansing]],<ref name=CASE-STUDY-IN-ETHNIC-STRIFE>{{cite journal|last=Rieff|first=David|title=Without Rules or Pity|work=Foreign Affairs|volume=76|issue=2|url=http://www.cilicia.com/armo19e.html|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=June 1997|accessdate=13 February 2007|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080720114733/http://www.cilicia.com/armo19e.html|archive-date=20 July 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Lieberman|first=Benjamin|title=Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe|publisher=Ivan R.

The initial advantage tilted in Azerbaijan's favor. During the [[Cold War]], the Soviet military doctrine for defending the Caucasus had outlined a strategy where Armenia would be a combat zone in the event that [[NATO]] member [[Turkey]] were to have invaded from the west. Thus, there were only three [[Division (military)|divisions]] stationed in the Armenian SSR and no [[airfields]], while Azerbaijan had a total of five divisions and five military airfields. Furthermore, Armenia had approximately 500 [[railroad cars]] of [[ammunition]] in comparison to Azerbaijan's 10,000.<ref name=\"Petrosian, David 2000\"/>\n\nAs MVD forces began pulling out, they bequeathed the Armenians and Azerbaijanis a vast arsenal of ammunition and stored [[armor]]ed vehicles. The government forces initially sent by Gorbachev three years earlier were from other republics of the Soviet Union and many had no wish to remain any longer. Most were poor, young [[conscript]]s and many simply sold their weapons for cash or even vodka to either side, some even trying to sell tanks and [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). The unsecured weapons caches led both sides to blame Gorbachev's policies as the ultimate cause of the conflict.<ref name=\"timestepanakert\">\n{{cite news|last=Carney|first=James|title=Former Soviet Union Carnage in Karabakh|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=13 April 1992|url=http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,975278,00.html|accessdate=13 April 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310121157/http://www.time.com/time/archive/preview/0,10987,975278,00.html|archive-date=10 March 2005|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}\n</ref> The Azerbaijanis purchased a large quantity of these vehicles, as reported by the Foreign Ministry of Azerbaijan in November 1993, which reported it had acquired 286 tanks, 842 armored vehicles, and 386 [[artillery]] pieces during the power vacuum.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=199}} The emergence of [[black market]]s helped facilitate the import of Western weaponry.<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Smith|first = Hedrick|title = The New Russians|publisher=Harper Perennial|year = 1991|location = New York|pages = 344\u2013345|isbn = 0-380-71651-8 }}</ref>\n\nMost weaponry was Russian-made or came from the former [[Eastern bloc]] countries; some improvisation was made by both sides. Azerbaijan received substantial military aid and provisions from [[Turkey]], Israel and numerous [[Arab]] countries.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> The [[Armenian Diaspora]] donated a significant amount of aid to Armenia through the course of the war and even managed to push for legislation in the [[United States Congress]] to pass a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] entitled Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act in response to Azerbaijan's blockade against Armenia, placing a complete ban on military aid from the United States to Azerbaijan in 1992.<ref>[[Section 907|Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act]]. Humanitarian aid was not explicitly banned but such supplies had to be routed through indirectly to aid organizations. On 25 January 2002, President [[George W. Bush]] signed a waiver that effectively repealed Section 907, thereby removing any restrictions that were barring the United States from sending military aid to Azerbaijan; military parity is maintained toward both sides.

Azerbaijan continues to maintain their road and air blockade against Armenia.</ref> While Azerbaijan charged that the Russians were initially helping the Armenians, it was said that \"the Azerbaijani fighters in the region [were] far better equipped with Soviet military weaponry than their opponents.\"<ref name=\"timestepanakert\"/>\n\nWith Gorbachev resigning as Soviet General-Secretary on 26 December 1991, the remaining republics including [[Ukraine]], Belarus, and [[Russia]], declared their independence and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on 31 December 1991. This dissolution gave way to any barriers that were keeping Armenia and Azerbaijan from waging a full-scale war. One month prior, on 21 November, the Azerbaijani Parliament had rescinded Karabakh's status as an autonomous region and renamed its capital \"Xankandi\". In response, on 10 December, a referendum was held in Karabakh by parliamentary leaders (with the local Azerbaijani community boycotting it), whereby the Armenians voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. On 6 January 1992, the region declared its independence from Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/>\n\nThe withdrawal of the Soviet interior forces from Nagorno-Karabakh in the Caucasus region was only temporary. By February 1992, the former Soviet states were consolidated as the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS). While Azerbaijan abstained from joining, Armenia, fearing a possible invasion by Turkey in the escalating conflict, entered the CIS, which brought it under the organization's \"collective security umbrella\". In January 1992, CIS forces established their new headquarters at Stepanakert and took up a slightly more active role in peacekeeping, incorporating old units, including the 366th Motorized Rifle Regiment and elements of the [[Soviet Fourth Army|Soviet 4th Army]].<ref name=\"Karagiannis\"/>\n\n==Building armies==\n[[File:Armenian soldiers in northern Artsakh 1994.tif|thumb|Armenian soldiers in Karabakh, 1994, wearing Soviet Army combat helmets and wielding [[AK-74]] assault rifles]]\n[[File:Azerbaijani soldiers during Nagorno Karabagh war.jpg|thumb|Azerbaijani soldiers during the war, 1992]]\nThe sporadic battles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis had intensified after Operation Ring recruited thousands of volunteers into improvised armies from both Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Armenia, a recurrent and popular theme at the time compared and idolized the separatist fighters to historical Armenian [[guerrilla]] groups and revered individuals such as [[Andranik Ozanian]] and [[Garegin Nzhdeh]], who fought against the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=208}} In addition to the government's conscription of males aged 18\u201345, many Armenians volunteered to fight and formed ''jokats'', or detachments of about forty men, which, combined with several others, came under the command of a [[lieutenant colonel]]. Initially, many of these men chose when and where to serve and acted on their own behalf, rarely with any oversight, when attacking or defending areas.<ref name=\"brothersroad\" /> Direct insubordination was common as many of the men simply did not show up, looted the bodies of dead soldiers and commodities such as diesel oil for armored vehicles disappeared only to be sold in black markets.<ref name=\"brothersroad\" />\n\nMany women enlisted in the Nagorno-Karabakh military, taking part in the fighting as well as serving in auxiliary roles such as providing [[first-aid]] and evacuating wounded men from the battlefield.\n\nAzerbaijan's military functioned in much the same manner; it was better organized during the first years of the war. The Azerbaijani government also carried out conscription and many Azerbaijanis enthusiastically enlisted for combat in the first months after the Soviet Union collapsed. Azerbaijan's National Army consisted of roughly 30,000 men, as well as nearly 10,000 in its OMON paramilitary force and several thousand volunteers from the Popular Front. [[Suret Huseynov]], a wealthy Azerbaijani, also improvised by creating his own military brigade, the 709th of the Azerbaijani Army and purchasing many weapons and vehicles from the 23rd Motor Rifle Division's arsenal.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=199}} [[Isgandar Hamidov]]'s ''bozqurt'' or [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]] brigade also mobilized for action. The government of Azerbaijan also poured a great deal of money into hiring mercenaries from other countries through the revenue it was making from its [[oil field]] assets on and near the [[Caspian Sea]].<ref name=\"Gurdelik\" />\n\nFormer troops of the Soviet Union also offered their services to either side. For example, one of the most prominent officers to serve on the Armenian side was former Soviet General [[Anatoly Zinevich]], who remained in Nagorno-Karabakh for five years (1992\u20131997) and was involved in planning and implementation of many operations of the Armenian forces. By the end of war he held the position of Chief of Staff of the Republic of Artsakh armed forces.

This offensive is regarded as the only successful breakthrough by the [[Azerbaijani Land Forces|Azerbaijani Army]] and marks the peak of Azerbaraijani success in the entirety of the six-year-long conflict. It also marks the beginning of a new, more intense, phase of the war. Over 8,000 Azerbaijani troops and four additional [[battalion]]s, at least 90 tanks and 70 [[Infantry fighting vehicle]]s, as well as [[Mi-24]] [[Attack helicopter|attack-helicopters]] were used in this operation.\n\nOn 12 June 1992, the Azerbaijani military launched a large-scale diversionary attack in the direction of the [[Askeran Region|Askeran region]] at the center of Nagorno-Karabakh. Two groups, numbering 4,000 men, attacked the positions to the north and south of Askeran.

This three-day offensive was code-named Operation ''Goranboy'' and commanded by [[Suret Huseynov]]. After fifteen hours of fierce fighting against Azerbaijani forces, the two Armenian detachments were forced to retreat. Azerbaijan managed to capture several dozen villages in the Goranboy region originally held by the Armenian forces, and the entire Armenian civilian population of this region fled.

While not completely shut off, material aid sent through Turkey arrived sporadically.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/>\n\nExperiencing both food shortages and power shortages, after the shutting down of the [[Metsamor]] nuclear power plant, Armenia's economic outlook appeared bleak: in Georgia, a new bout of civil wars against separatists in Abkhazia and Ossetia began, and supply convoys were raided and the only oil pipeline leading from Russia to Armenia was repeatedly destroyed.

Its oil refineries were not generating at full capacity and production quotas fell well short of estimates. In 1965, the oil fields in Baku were producing 21.5&nbsp;million tons of oil annually; by 1988, that number had dropped down to almost 3.3&nbsp;million.

Azerbaijan's President Elchibey expressed optimism toward bringing an agreeable solution to the conflict with Armenia's Ter-Petrosyan.

Azerbaijan's military had grown more desperate, and defense minister Gaziev and Huseynov's brigade turned to Russian help, a move which ran against Elchibey's policies and were construed as insubordination. Political infighting and arguments about where to shift military units between the country's ministry of the interior [[Isgandar Hamidov]] and Gaziev led to the latter's resignation on 20 February.

With a population of about 60,000, the several dozen villages were made up of Azerbaijani and [[Kurds]].{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=14}} In March 1993, the Armenian-held areas near the [[Sarsang reservoir]] in [[Martakert Region|Mardakert]] were reported to have been coming under attack by the Azerbaijanis. After successfully defending the Martuni region, Melkonian's fighters were tasked to move to capture the region of Kalbajar, where the incursions and artillery shelling were said to have been coming from.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/>\n\nScant military opposition by the Azerbaijanis allowed Melkonian's fighters to gain a foothold in the region and along the way capture several abandoned armored vehicles and tanks. At 2:45&nbsp;pm, on 2 April, Armenian forces from two directions advanced toward Kalbajar in an attack that struck Azerbaijani armor and troops entrenched near the Ganja-Kalbajar intersection. Azerbaijani forces were unable to halt the advances made by Armenian armor and were wiped out completely. The second attack toward Kalbajar also quickly overran the defenders. By 3 April, Armenian forces were in possession of Kalbajar.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> President Elchibey imposed a state of emergency for a period of two months and introduced universal conscription.\n\nOn 30 April, the [[United Nations Security Council|United Nations Security Council (UNSC)]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 822|Resolution 822]], co-sponsored by [[Turkey]] and [[Pakistan]], demanding the immediate cessation of all hostilities and the withdrawal of all occupying forces from Kalbajar.<ref name=\"UN\">\n[https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/13508.htm#822 United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 passed on 30 April 1993]  .

Frustrated with what he felt was Elchibey's incompetence and demoted from his rank of colonel, his brigade advanced in early June from its base in Ganje toward Baku with the explicit aim of unseating the president. Elchibey stepped down from office on 18 June and power was assumed by then parliamentary member [[Heydar Aliyev]].

The Armenian side made use of the political crisis in Baku, which had left the Karabakh front almost undefended by the Azerbaijani forces.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> The following four months of political instability in Azerbaijan led to the loss of control over five districts, as well as the north of Nagorno-Karabakh.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> Azerbaijani military forces were unable to put up much resistance in the face of Armenian advances and abandoned most of their positions without so much as putting up a fight.<ref name=\"dewaal\"/> In late June, they were driven out from Martakert, losing their final foothold of the enclave. By July, Armenian forces were preparing to attack and capture the region of [[Agdam Rayon|Agdam]], another rayon that fell outside of Nagorno-Karabakh, claiming that they were attempting to widen a [[Security belt of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|barrier]] that would keep towns and villages and their positions out of the range of Azerbaijani artillery.<ref>The genuineness of the NKR's reasons for launching the 1993 summer offensives were called into question and it was postulated that Karabakh forces were wantonly seizing the territories surrounding the enclave. While many doubted the veracity of the claims, periodic fighting between the two sides in the region were reported to have taken place in the months before the offensives took place.</ref>\n\nOn 4 July artillery bombardment commenced against Agdam by Armenian forces, destroying many parts of the town. Soldiers, along with civilians, began to evacuate Agdam. Facing military collapse, Aliyev attempted to mediate with the [[de facto]] Karabakh government and Minsk Group officials. In mid-August, Armenians massed a force to take the Azerbaijani-held regions of [[Fuzuli District|Fizuli]] and [[Jabrayil|Jebrail]], south of Nagorno-Karabakh proper.\n\nIn light of the Armenians' advance into Azerbaijan, Turkey's prime minister [[Tansu \u00c7iller]], warned the Armenian government not to attack Nakhichevan and demanded that Armenians pull out of Azerbaijan's territories. Thousands of Turkish troops were sent to the border between Turkey and Armenia in early September. Russian Federation forces in Armenia in turn countered their movements and thus warded off the possible Turkish participation in the conflict.<ref>During the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]], one of the coup's leaders against Russian President Yeltsin, [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], was reported by the US and French intelligence agencies to preparing Russian troop withdrawals from Armenia if the coup succeeded. An estimated 23,000 Russian soldiers were stationed in Armenia on the border with Turkey. \u00c7iller was reported by the agencies to be collaborating with Khasbulatov for him to give her tacit support in allowing possible military incursions by Turkey into Armenia under the pretext of pursuing [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] guerrillas, an act it had once followed up on earlier the same year in northern [[Iraq]]. Russian armed forces crushed the coup.</ref>\n\nBy early September, Azerbaijani forces were nearly in complete disarray. Many of the heavy weapons they had received and bought from the Russians had been taken out of action or abandoned during the battles. Since the June 1992 offensive, Armenian forces had captured dozens of tanks, light armor, and artillery from Azerbaijan. For example, according to Monte Melkonian in a television interview in March 1993, his forces in Martuni alone had captured or destroyed a total of 55 [[T-72]]s, 24 [[BMP-2]]s, 15 [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and 25 pieces of heavy artillery since the June 1992 Goranboy offensive. \"Most of our arms,\" he stated, \"[were] captured from Azerbaijan.\"<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/> [[Serzh Sargsyan]], the then military leader of the Karabakh armed forces, tallied a total of 156 tanks captured through the course of the war.{{sfn|de Waal|2003|p=316}} By mid-1993, Armenian forces had captured so much equipment that many of them were praising Elchibey, since he was, in effect, arming both sides.<ref name=\"brothersroad\"/>\n\nFurther signs of Azerbaijan's desperation included the recruitment by Aliyev of 1,000\u20131,500 [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan]] and Arab [[mujahadeen]] fighters from [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Charalampidis|first=Ioannis|title=Sponsored To Kill: Mercenaries and Terrorist Networks in Azerbaijan|year=2013|publisher=\"MIA\" Publishers|location=Moscow|isbn=978-5-9986-0115-6|url=http://karabakhfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ioannis-Charalampidis-Sponsored-to-Kill-ENG.pdf|ref=harv|access-date=18 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129225618/http://karabakhfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ioannis-Charalampidis-Sponsored-to-Kill-ENG.pdf|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/international+terrorism/dt20-2008 Michael Taarnby \"The Mujahedin in Nagorno-Karabakh: A Case Study in the Evolution of Global Jihad\" (WP) 20/2008 \u2013 9/5/2008]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407100252/http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Felcano%2Felcano_in%2Fzonas_in%2Finternational%20terrorism%2Fdt20-2008 |date=7 April 2014 }}</ref> Although the Azerbaijani government denied this claim, correspondence and photographs captured by Armenian forces indicated otherwise.<ref name=\"Croissant\"/> A United States-based petroleum company, [[MEGA OIL]], also hired several American military trainers as a prerequisite for Azerbaijan to grant it drilling rights at its oil fields.<ref name=\"Gurdelik\"/>\n\n==Aerial warfare==\n{{See also|Armenian Air Force|Azerbaijani Air Force|Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army#Air Force|1992 Azerbaijani Mil Mi-8 shootdown}}\nThe aerial warfare in Karabakh involved primarily [[fighter jets]] and attack helicopters.

The offensive managed to advance and take back several parts of Karabakh in the north and to the south but soon petered out. In response, the Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to stop the Azerbaijani advance in Karabakh.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=121}} To bolster the ranks of its army, the Armenian government issued a decree that instituted a three-month call-up for men up to age forty-five and resorted to press-gang raids to enlist recruits.

The two offensives that took place in the winter cost Azerbaijan as many as 5,000 lives (at the loss of several hundred Armenians).<ref name=\"Croissant\"/> The main Azerbaijani offensive was aimed at recapturing the Kalbajar district, which would thus threaten the Lachin corridor. The attack initially met little resistance and was successful in capturing the vital Omar Pass. As the Armenian forces reacted, the bloodiest clashes of the war ensued and the Azerbaijani forces were soundly defeated. In a single episode of that time's clashes, Azerbaijan lost about fifteen hundred of its soldiers after the failed offensive in Kalbajar.<ref>de Waal, Thomas. ''The Caucasus. An Introduction''.

Armenian-Russian journalist [[Dmitri Pisarenko]] who spent a year at the front line and filmed many of the battles later wrote that both Armenian and Azerbaijani journalists were preoccupied with echoing the official stands of their respective governments and that \"objectiveness was being sacrificed for ideology.\" Armenian military commanders were eager to give interviews following Azerbaijani offensives when they were able to criticise the other side for launching heavy artillery attacks that the \"small-numbered but proud Armenians\" had to fight off. Yet they were reluctant to speak out when Armenian troops seized a village outside Nagorno-Karabakh in order to avoid justifying such acts.

A study of the four largest Canadian newspapers covering the event showed that the journalists tended to present the massacre of Azeris as a secondary issue, as well as to rely on Armenian sources, to give priority to Armenian denials over Azerbaijani \"allegations\" (which were described as \"grossly exaggerated\"), to downplay the scale of death, not to publish images of the bodies and mourners, and not to mention the event in editorials and opinion columns.<ref name=\"karim\"/>\n\n==Post-ceasefire violence and mediation==\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains one of several frozen conflicts in the former Soviet Union, alongside Georgia's breakaway regions of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]], Moldova's troubles with [[Transnistria]], and [[Ukraine]]'s [[War in Donbass|war with Russian-backed separatists]] and the [[Occupation of Crimea|Russian occupation of Crimea]].

The pyramid symbolized longevity and permanence and the beehive stood for industry and thrift.  When first installed, the beehive also contained four directional beacons, a metaphor for the company's global reach.  The pyramid is supported by the four bisons, a traditional symbol for the American West.  Straus was hoping to use these symbols to instill trust in their customers, to reassure them that their investments would be handled actively and carefully by an institution that could be trusted over the long term. Ironically, the firm failed during the [[Great Depression]] and closed fewer than ten years after lighting the beacon.<ref>{{cite web | title = Metropolitan Tower | work = Exploring 66 on Foot: In the Loop, Where the Road Begins | url= http://www.windycityroadwarrior.com/GiftShop/BOOK-Hybrid-144-145.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Area ==\nThe Metropolitan Tower is located a block from the entrance to the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]] and is within two blocks of stations for all downtown [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] train lines.

The pyramid symbolized longevity and permanence and the beehive stood for industry and thrift.  When first installed, the beehive also contained four directional beacons, a metaphor for the company's global reach.  The pyramid is supported by the four bisons, a traditional symbol for the American West.  Straus was hoping to use these symbols to instill trust in their customers, to reassure them that their investments would be handled actively and carefully by an institution that could be trusted over the long term. Ironically, the firm failed during the [[Great Depression]] and closed fewer than ten years after lighting the beacon.<ref>{{cite web | title = Metropolitan Tower | work = Exploring 66 on Foot: In the Loop, Where the Road Begins | url= http://www.windycityroadwarrior.com/GiftShop/BOOK-Hybrid-144-145.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2007-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Area ==\nThe Metropolitan Tower is located a block from the entrance to the [[Art Institute of Chicago|Art Institute]] and is within two blocks of stations for all downtown [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] train lines.

Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, and for his personal wealth, his opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. Cobbett now sold the ''Political Register'' for only two pence and it soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible.

He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Walters, Ronald G., ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett arrived back in England soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in his attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll.  That year he also established a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust (''Robinia pseudoacacia''), and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden that turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing, and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of the rural Englishman. He began riding about the country on horseback, observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing ''Rural Rides'', Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the British reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.  Sketch by [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]].]]\nIn 1829, Cobbett published ''Advice To Young Men'', in which he criticised ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. That year he also published ''The English Gardener'', which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Gardening''.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nCobbett continued to publish controversy in the ''Political Register'' and was charged in July 1831 with [[seditious libel]] for a pamphlet entitled ''Rural War'', endorsing the Captain [[Swing Riots]], in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 789.</ref>\n\nCobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.

He believed that reforming [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]], including abolishing \"[[rotten borough]]s\", would ease the poverty of farm labourers. Relentlessly he sought an end to borough-mongers, [[Sinecure|sinecurists]] and \"tax-eaters\" (meaning a wide class of overpaid or corrupt bureaucrats). Early in life he was a loyal devotee of King and Country, but he later pushed for [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]], which helped bring about the [[Reform Act 1832]] and his election that year as one of two [[member of Parliament|MPs]] for the newly enfranchised borough of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].

He later claimed that he had become a political writer by accident: during an English lesson one of his French students read aloud from a New York newspaper the addresses of welcome that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had sent to [[Joseph Priestley]] upon his arrival in America, along with Priestley's replies.

Both men campaigned together but failed, having refused to bribe voters by \"buying\" votes.

He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison]]. While in prison he wrote the pamphlet, ''Paper Against Gold'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Cobbett |first=William |title=Paper Against Gold |url=https://archive.org/details/cobbettspaperaga00cobbrich |work=Cobbett's Paper Against Gold |publisher=California Digital Library |accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref> warning of the dangers of [[Banknote|paper money]], as well as many essays and letters. On his release a dinner was given in his honour in London. Attended by 600 people, it was directed by [[Sir Francis Burdett, 5th Baronet|Sir Francis Burdett]], who, like Cobbett, was an enthusiast for parliamentary reform.\n\n{{anchor|Two-Penny Trash}}\n\n===\"Two-Penny Trash\" (1812\u20131817)===\nBy 1815 the tax on newspapers had reached four [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]] a copy. As few people could afford to pay six or seven pence for a daily newspaper, the tax restricted the circulation of most journals to those with fairly high incomes. Cobbett could sell only just over a thousand copies a week. Nonetheless, he began criticising [[William Wilberforce]] for his endorsement of the Corn Laws, and for his personal wealth, his opposition to bull and [[bear-baiting]], and particularly for his approval of \"the fat and lazy and laughing and singing negroes\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/251 251\u2013252]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816 Cobbett began publishing the ''Political Register'' as a pamphlet. Cobbett now sold the ''Political Register'' for only two pence and it soon had a circulation of 40,000. Critics termed it \"two-penny trash\", a phrase Cobbett adopted.<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Cobbett's journal was soon the main newspaper read by the working class. The Radical campaigner [[Samuel Bamford]] later wrote:\n\n<blockquote>At this time the writings of William Cobbett suddenly became of great authority; they were read on nearly every cottage hearth in the manufacturing districts of South Lancashire, in those of Leicester, Derby, and Nottingham; also in many of the Scottish manufacturing towns. Their influence was speedily visible. He directed his readers to the true cause of their sufferings\u2014misgovernment; and to its proper corrective\u2014parliamentary reform.<ref>Samuel Bamford, ''Bamford's Passages in the Life of a Radical, and Early Days: Vol. II'' (London: T.

With the government intending to [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1817|suspend ''habeas corpus'']], and fearing arrest for his arguably seditious writings, Cobbett fled to the United States.<ref name=\"DNB\" /> On Wednesday 27 March 1817, he embarked at [[Liverpool]] for New York on the ship ''Importer'', with D. Ogden as master, accompanied by his two eldest sons, William and John.\n\n===Refuge in the United States (1817\u20131819)===\n[[File:Cobbett - Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England, 1930 - 5214769.tif|thumb|''Rural rides in the southern, western and eastern counties of England'', 1930.]]\nCobbett lived for two years on a farm on [[Long Island]], where he wrote ''Grammar of the English Language'' and with help from [[William Benbow]], a friend in London, continued to issue the ''Political Register''. He also wrote ''The American Gardener'' (1821), one of the earliest horticultural books published in the United States.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nCobbett closely observed alcohol-drinking habits in the United States. He stated in 1819, \"Americans preserve their gravity and quietness and good-humour even in their drink.\"  He believed it would be \"far better for them to be as noisy and quarrelsome as the English drunkards; for then the odiousness of the vice would be more visible, and the vice itself might become less frequent.\"<ref>Walters, Ronald G., ''Getting Rid of Demon Alcohol''.</ref>\n\nA plan to return to England with the remains of the British-American radical pamphleteer and revolutionary [[Thomas Paine]] (who had died in 1809) for a proper burial resulted in the ultimate loss of the remains. The plan was to remove them from his [[New Rochelle, New York]] [[Thomas Paine Cottage|farm]] and give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but the bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died 16 years later. There is no confirmed story of what happened to them after that, although claims to parts of the body have been made down the years, including his skull and right hand.\n\nCobbett arrived back in Britain at Liverpool by ship in November 1819.\n\n{{anchor|Later life}}\n\n===Later life (1819\u20131835)===\nCobbett arrived back in England soon after the [[Peterloo Massacre]]. He joined with other [[Radicalism (historical)|radicals]] in his attacks on the government and was charged with libel three times in the next couple of years.\n\n[[Image:Batteuse 1881.jpg|300px|right|thumb|The introduction of horse-powered threshing machines to farms was one of the principal causes of the [[Swing Riots]].]]\n\nIn 1820, he campaigned for Parliament in [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]], but finished last in the poll.  That year he also established a plant nursery at Kensington, where he grew many North American trees, such as the black locust (''Robinia pseudoacacia''), and with his son, a variety of maize he called \"Cobbett's corn\".<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> This was a dwarf strain found growing in a French cottage garden that turned out to grow well in England's shorter summer. To help sell the variety he issued a book entitled ''A Treatise on Cobbett's Corn'' (1828).<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/> Meanwhile he also wrote his popular ''[[Cottage Economy]]'' (1822), which taught cottagers some skills necessary for self-sufficiency, such as bread-making, beer-brewing, and livestock farming.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nNot content to let information be brought to him for his newspaper, Cobbett did his own journalistic work \u2013 especially on his repeated theme of the plight of the rural Englishman. He began riding about the country on horseback, observing events in towns and villages. ''[[Rural Rides]]'', a work for which Cobbett is still known, appeared first in serial form in the ''Political Register'' from 1822 to 1826, and then in book form in 1830. While writing ''Rural Rides'', Cobbett also produced ''The Woodlands'' (1825), a book on [[silviculture]].<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nAlthough not a Catholic,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hanink |first=James G |date=November 2005 |title=William Cobbett.

Between 1824 and 1826, he published his ''History of the Protestant Reformation'', a broadside against the traditional [[Protestant]] historical narrative of the British reformation, stressing the lengthy and often bloody persecutions of Catholics in Britain and Ireland. Catholics were still forbidden at that time to enter certain professions or become members of parliament. Although the law was no longer enforced, it was officially still a crime to attend mass or build a Catholic church. Although Wilberforce also worked and spoke against discrimination against Catholics, Cobbett resumed his strident opposition to the noted reformer, particularly after Wilberforce in 1823 published his ''Appeal in Behalf of the Negro Slaves in the West Indies.''<ref>{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Metaxas |authorlink=Eric Metaxas |year=2007 |title=Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery |url=https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/amazinggrace00meta/page/264 264\u2013265]}}</ref>  Wilberforce, long suffering from ill health, retired the next year.\n[[File:John Doyle 1833 MPs.JPG|200px|right|thumb|William Cobbett (left foreground), [[John Gully]] (middle) and [[Joseph Pease (railway pioneer)|Joseph Pease]] (right) (the first Quaker elected to Parliament) arriving at Westminster, during March 1833.  Sketch by [[John Doyle (artist)|John Doyle]].]]\nIn 1829, Cobbett published ''Advice To Young Men'', in which he criticised ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' by the Reverend [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]. That year he also published ''The English Gardener'', which he later updated and expanded. This book has been compared favourably with other contemporary garden tomes, such as [[John Claudius Loudon]]'s ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Gardening''.<ref name=\"Clifford-Smith, S. 2008, pp. 4-6\"/>\n\nCobbett continued to publish controversy in the ''Political Register'' and was charged in July 1831 with [[seditious libel]] for a pamphlet entitled ''Rural War'', endorsing the Captain [[Swing Riots]], in which rioters were smashing farm machinery and burning haystacks. Cobbett successfully conducted his own defence.<ref>State Trials (New Series) II, 789.</ref>\n\nCobbett still sought to be elected to the House of Commons. He was defeated in [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1826 and in Manchester in 1832, but after the passage of the [[1832 Reform Act]], Cobbett won the seat of [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]]. In Parliament, Cobbett concentrated his energies on attacking corruption in government and the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|1834 Poor Law]]. During later life, however, [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Macaulay]], a fellow [[Member of Parliament|MP]], remarked that Cobbett's faculties were impaired by age; indeed that his [[paranoia]] had reached insanity.\n\nFrom 1831 until his death, Cobbett managed a farm named Ash in the village of [[Normandy, Surrey]], a few miles from his birthplace at [[Farnham]]. Cobbett died there after a brief illness in June 1835 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Parish Church, Farnham.\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nDuring his lifetime Cobbett campaigned for parliament five times, of which four attempts were unsuccessful:\n*1806 [[Honiton (UK Parliament constituency)|Honiton]]\n*1820 [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]]\n*1826 [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]]\n*1832 [[Manchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester]]\n\nIn 1832 he was successfully elected as member for [[Oldham (UK Parliament constituency)|Oldham]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Cobbett Grave 2016.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of William Cobbett in the churchyard of St Andrew's church in Farnham.]]\nCobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided an alternative opinion of rural England in the age of an [[Industrial Revolution]], with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country\".<ref name=\"ODNB\" /> [[Ian Dyck]] claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] platform\".<ref>[[Ian Dyck]], 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, ''Rural Rides'' (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.</ref> [[Edward Tangye Lean]] described him as \"an archaic English Tory\".<ref>[[Edward Tangye Lean]], ''The Napoleonists.
