His ideas and practice on education and youth became highly influential but were also controversial.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHe was born to a Christian family, and studied [[theology]] and [[philology]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1900 he married Luise Margaretha Dammermann, from whom he was divorced in 1910. From 1900 to 1906 he worked as a teacher in boarding schools, where he was a colleague of [[Hermann Lietz]].\n\n==''Jugendkultur'' and ''P\u00e4dagogischer Eros''==\n\nWyneken coined two influential terms.\n\nThe first term was \"pedagogic eros\", the name given to erotic attraction and/or love between a teacher and a pupil. Pedagogic eros (or ''[[P\u00e4dagogischer Eros]]'' in German) was embodied as a set of concepts popularised by Wyneken's [[:de:Freie Schulgemeinde Wickersdorf|Wickersdorf Free School Community]] in [[Germany]], and based around the [[Straton of Sardis|Ancient Greek]] [[Plato]]nic 'Ladder of Beauty' model of same-sex pedagogic relationships, but blended with high Germanic philosophical ideas. Although focused on same-sex relationships, his ideas could also be applied to [[heterosexual]]ity. He led the wider Free School (or '''Freie Schulgemeinde''' in German) movement, a movement that founded [[boarding school]]s across Germany.\n\nThe second term was ''[[Jugendkultur]]''; this implied that wherever possible adults should refrain from overtly 'leading' youth groups, and older youths should instead lead younger youths. This was part of his deep influence on the [[German Youth Movement]]; notably the ''[[Jugendkulturbewegung]]'', the ''[[Wandervogel]]'' and [[Adolf Brand]]'s ''Gemeinschaft der Eigenen''. He downplayed the then-popular notions of the need for a restored [[Volk]]ish German culture and was not known to be [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]]. His Free Schools accepted a large portion of Jewish pupils. In a sense, by coining and encouraging 'Jugendkultur' he was the founder of what would later become widely known as 'youth culture'.\n\nWyneken also influenced [[Jewish]] youth movements in [[Poland]]  and [[Vienna]] (such as [[Hashomer Hatzair]]), and had some influence on the early [[kibbutz]] education in [[Israel]].  He also known to have influenced the circle around [[Stefan George]]; [[Bruno Bettelheim]]; and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]'s school in [[Casarsa]], as well as Pasolini's later teaching.\n\nWyneken had himself been influenced by the thinking of [[Martin Buber]] and [[Hermann Lietz]], and also the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] educational tradition, in which a good education is founded on a teacher's love for his students.\n\nIn the maelstrom of ideas and ideologies that was pre-war Germany, inevitably his strong ideas caused much controversy.\n\n==Wyneken and Walter Benjamin==\n\nThe young [[Walter Benjamin]]'s political aesthetics were greatly influenced by a stay (1905-1907) at a Wyneken [[boarding school]] (Haubinda in [[Thuringia|Th\u00fcringen]]) where he became close to Wyneken. He was also influenced by the Wyneken-edited radical youth journal ''Der Anfang'' ('The Beginning'). Here Benjamin found...\n\n:\"... an elitist, aristocratic and fiercely intellectualist wing of the German youth movement ... Wyneken's ideal (was) of an elite and highly ethical M\u00e4nnerbund devoted to the ideals of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Goethe]] and [[Nietzsche]].\" (Rabinbach, 1985)\n\nHowever, when Gustav Wyneken gave a broadly pro-war speech in [[Munich]] in November 1914, the pacifist Benjamin reluctantly broke with his mentor. Wyneken did, however, also urge that... \"We must dare to keep a certain distance from the Fatherland and from the unthinking patriotism in which we have been educated.\"\n\n==Wickersdorf scandal==\n\nIn 1920 Wyneken was forced to resign as leader of the Free School Community amidst allegations of homosexual relations with two students. Many parents and the leadership of the school defended Wyneken. Subsequently, he was indicted of committing vice with minors and convicted in 1921.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Sandfort | first1 = Theo | last2 = Brongersma | first2 = Edward | last3 = van Naerssen | first3 = A.

His prosecution for immorality (he had allegedly embraced two pupils while naked) under [[Paragraph 175]] of the German Criminal Code in 1921 means that it is unlikely that he was involved with the [[Nazi Party]].\n\n==Wider cultural influence==\n\nWyneken's ideas on pedagogical eros, related through gay emigres to the USA, influenced the fiction and educationalist writings of [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]].  He also influenced [[Homer Lane]] who settled in England in 1912 to run the 'Little Commonwealth' school in [[Dorset]], and who became the mentor of [[A.S. Neill]].\n\nWyneken's ideas and influence allowed pedagogic eros to be treated in cultural productions such as one of the first feature-films on same-sex love, ''[[M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931 film)|M\u00e4dchen in Uniform]]'' (Germany, 1931), based on the novel ''The Child Manuela'' by [[Christa Winsloe]].  Among many other cultural manifestations from this era in Germany are: [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]]'s novel ''Jakob von Gunten'' (1908; English trans. 1995); and [[Erich Ernst]]'s novel ''Symphony of Eros'' (1925). [[Colette]]'s novel ''Claudine at School'' (1957 in English) reflects some of the influence of German ideas on teaching traditions in [[France|French]] boarding schools.\n\nThe theme has continued to be explored in literature and film; most recently in novels by David Cook (''Happy Endings'', 1989); [[Stephen Fry]]; and [[Alan Hollinghurst]]; in poetry and song lyrics by [[Pauline Stainer]] (\"The Flute Lesson\"), [[Momus (artist)|Momus]] (\"The Guitar Lesson\"), [[Rufus Wainwright]] (\"The Art Teacher\"), and Sting (\"[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]\").\n\nFor a fuller discussion & bibliography of the appearance of the theme in books and films; see: Jo Keroes's book ''Tales Out of School: Gender, Longing and the Teacher in Fiction and Film'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1999); and for a discussion of U.S. classroom issues see: Regina Barreca and Deborah Morse's ''The Erotics of Instruction'' (1998).\n\n==List of works==\n\n* (1916) Wider den Altsprachlichen Schulunterricht\n* (1918) Schule und Jugendkultur\n* (1920) Der Kampf f\u00fcr die Jugend.

The organismic emotion is the outburst of emotions and feelings. In organismic emotion, emotions/feelings are instantly expressed.

In interactive emotion, unlike in organismic emotion, the individual is aware of their decision on how they feel and how they show it.\n\n[[Erving Goffman]], a sociologist and writer, compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual. Like actors, individuals can control how emotions are expressed, but they cannot control their inner emotions or feelings. Inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to achieve the expression one wants people to see on the outside.

When an individual is dealing with an overwhelming amount of stress and problems in their lives, it can lead to self-harm. When one is in a good state of feeling, they never want it to end; conversely, when someone is in a bad state, they want that feeling to disappear. Inflicting harm or pain to oneself is sometimes the answer for many individuals because they want something to keep their mind off the real problem. These individuals cut, stab, and starve themselves in an effort to feel something other than what they currently feel, as they believe the pain to be not as bad as their actual problem.

The way an individual responds to a situation is based on [[feeling rules]]. If an individual is uninformed about a situation the way they respond would be in a completely different demeanor than if they were informed about a situation. For example, if a tragic event had occurred and they had knowledge of it, their response would be sympathetic to that situation.

Wilson]], a psychology professor, tested this theory of the feeling of uncertainty along with his colleague Yoav Bar-Anan, a social psychologist.

Since an individual does not know the background or the ending of a story they are constantly replaying an event in their mind which is causing them to have mixed feelings of happiness, sadness, excitement, and et cetera.  If there is any difference between feelings and emotions, the feeling of uncertainty is less sure than the emotion of ambivalence: the former is precarious, the latter is not yet acted upon or decided upon.\n\nIndividuals in society want to know every detail about something in hopes to maximize the feeling for that moment, but Wilson found that feeling uncertain can lead to something being more enjoyable because it has a sense of mystery.

Emotion work is done to achieve a certain feeling that one believes they should feel.\n\nThree more specific types of emotion work are cognitive, bodily, and expressive. Cognitive changes images, bodily changes physical aspects, and expressive changes gestures. A person who is sad uses expressive emotion work to lift their spirits by trying to smile. A person who is stressed uses bodily emotion work by trying to breathe slower in order to lower stress levels. Emotion work allows individuals to change their feelings to suit the current situation.\n\nFeelings are deemed appropriate if they fit the current situation.

The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated.

Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]].

Twelve teams participated in the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|tournament]], including [[Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Canada]] for the first time since 1968. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more in Lake Placid. The team consisted of full-time players with significant experience in international play. By contrast, the United States' team\u2014led by head coach [[Herb Brooks]]\u2014consisted exclusively of [[amateur]] players with mostly [[College ice hockey|college]] experience, and was the youngest team in the tournament and in U.S. national team history. In the group stage, both the Soviet and U.S. teams were unbeaten; the U.S. achieved several notable results, including a 2\u20132 draw against Sweden, and a 7\u20133 upset victory over second-place favorites [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]].\n\nFor the first game in the medal round, the United States played the Soviets. The first period finished tied at 2\u20132, and the Soviets lead 3\u20132 following the second. The U.S. team scored two more goals to take their first lead during the third and final period, winning the game 4\u20133. Following the game, the U.S. went on to clinch the gold medal by beating [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] in the final. The Soviet Union took the silver medal<!--Please do not change to Bronze. the USSR won Silver it was a round robin medal round--> by beating [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]].\n\nThe victory became one of the most iconic moments of the Games and in U.S. sports.

The men's tournament was introduced at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] and was transferred permanently to the [[Winter Olympic Games]] program in 1924, in France. The women's tournament was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]].\n\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for [[Amateur sports|amateur athletes]].  However, the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref name=\"Benjamin, Daniel\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) was initially reluctant to allow its players to compete because the Olympics are held in the middle of the NHL season, and the league would have to halt play if many of its players participated. Eventually, NHL players were admitted starting in 1998.<ref name=schantz>{{cite web|last=Schantz |first=Otto |title=The Olympic Ideal and the Winter Games Attitudes Towards the Olympic Winter Games in Olympic Discourses\u2014from Coubertin to Samaranch |publisher=Comit\u00e9 International Pierre De Coubertin |url=http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=13 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505052232/http://www.coubertin.ch/pdf/schantz.pdf |archive-date=5 May 2013}}</ref> However, the NHL again refused to release its players starting in 2018, citing financial reasons.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1988, the tournament started with a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] series of games and ended with the medal round. Medals were awarded based on points accumulated during that round. In 1992, the playoffs were introduced for the first time since [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]. In 1998, the format of the tournament was adjusted to accommodate the NHL schedule; a preliminary round was played without NHL players or the top six teams\u2014Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States\u2014followed by a final round which included them. The tournament format was changed again in 2006; every team played five preliminary games with the full use of NHL players.\n\nThe games of the tournament follow the [[Ice hockey rules|rules]] of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF), which differ slightly from the [[National Hockey League rules|rules used in the NHL]].\n\nIn the men's tournament, [[Canada at the Winter Olympics|Canada]] was the most successful team of the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. [[Czechoslovakia at the Olympics|Czechoslovakia]], [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] and the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] were also competitive during this period and won multiple medals. Between 1920 and 1968, the Olympic hockey tournament was also counted as the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Ice Hockey World Championship]] for that year. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] first participated in [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]] and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The United States won gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]] and in [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]], which included their \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\" upset of the Soviet Union. Canada went 50 years without a gold medal, before winning one in [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], and following it with back-to-back wins in [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]. Other nations to win gold include [[Great Britain at the Olympics|Great Britain]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]], the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], Sweden in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]] and the [[Czech Republic at the Olympics|Czech Republic]] in [[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics|1998]]. Other medal-winning nations include [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]], [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] and [[Russia at the Olympics|Russia]].\n\nIn July 1992, the IOC voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; it was first held at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was hesitant to include the event because of the additional costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The [[Canada women's national ice hockey team|Canadian]] teams have dominated the event. The United States won the first tournament in 1998 and the most recent in 2018. Canada has won all of the other tournaments (2002\u20132014).\n\n==Inception as an Olympic sport==\n[[Image:Winnipegfalcons.jpg|thumb|left|251px|Representing Canada, the [[Winnipeg Falcons]] (''pictured en route to the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]'') were the first Olympic champions in ice hockey.]]\nThe first Olympic ice hockey tournament took place at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |title=Ice hockey |publisher=International Olympic Committee |access-date=1 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323022731/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/index_uk.asp?SportCode=IH |archive-date=23 March 2009 |df= }}</ref> At the time, organized international ice hockey was still relatively new.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hockey: Canada's Royal Winter Game|year=1899|last=Farrell|first=Arthur|publisher=C.R.

In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], it would no longer cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that \"In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that\u2019s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel or any of the other expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang.\" ''[[The New York Times]]'' felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that \"in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes20160520\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/sports/hockey/olympics-and-nhl-face-off-over-who-pays-to-insure-players.html?_r=0 | title=Olympics and N.H.L.

As to reasons the Board of Governors might be interested in re-evaluating their strongly held views on the subject, the NHLPA \"confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the Clubs\", and that it would not schedule a break for the Olympics in the 2017\u201318 season.<ref name=\"sn-nonhl2018\">{{cite web|title=NHL will not participate in 2018 Pyeongchang Olympic Games|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/|website=Sportsnet.ca|publisher=Rogers Media|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAlthough in the following months the president of the IIHF Ren\u00e9 Fasel tried to convince NHL to change its decision,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/news/article/nhl-said-olympic-matter-is-closed-but-iihf-president-fasel-begs-to-differ |title=NHL said Olympic matter is closed, but IIHF president Fasel begs to differ |author=Jared Clinton |date=8 May 2017 |website=The Hockey News |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> in September he stated that there was no chance for participation of NHL players in the Pyeongchang olympic tournament. \"I can say that this is now gone.

It began to develop early in the history of the [[Christian Church]], modeled upon scriptural examples and ideals, including those in the [[Old Testament]], but not mandated as an institution in the scriptures. It has come to be regulated by religious rules (e.g. [[the Rule of Saint Augustine]], [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great|St Pachomius]], the [[Rule of St Basil]], the [[Rule of St Benedict]],) and, in modern times, the [[Canon law]] of the respective [[Christian denomination]]s that have forms of monastic living. Those living the monastic life are known by the generic terms [[monk]]s (men) and [[nuns]] (women). The word ''monk'' originated from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|monachos}}, 'monk'), itself from {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|monos}}) meaning  'alone'.<ref>{{OEtymD|monk}}</ref><ref>Corbishley, Mike.Monks lived a very strict and regulated life.

As more people took on the lives of monks, living alone in the wilderness, they started to come together and model themselves after the original monks nearby. Quickly, the monks formed communities to further their ability to observe an [[ascetic]] life.<ref>Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times.

Monastic life is distinct from the \"religious orders\" such as the [[friar]]s, [[canons regular]], [[clerks regular]], and the more recent [[religious congregation]]s. The latter has essentially some special work or aim, such as preaching, teaching, liberating captives, etc., which occupies a large place in their activities. While monks have undertaken labors of the most varied character, in every case this work is extrinsic to the essence of the monastic state.<ref name=huddleston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10459a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. \"Monasticism.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

New York: Franklin Watts, 1995, page 37.</ref>\n\nBoth ways of living out the Christian life are regulated by the respective church law of those Christian denominations that recognize it (e.g., the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Anglican Church]], or the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]]). Christian monastic life does not always involve communal living with like-minded Christians.  Christian monasticism has varied greatly in its external forms, but, broadly speaking, it has two main types (a) the [[eremitical]] or secluded, (b) the [[cenobitical]] or city life. [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] may be called the founder of the first and [[St. Pachomius]] of the second.<ref name=trappist>[http://www.trappist.net/EarlyMonasticism \"Early Monasticism\", Monastery of the Holy Spirit]</ref> The monastic life is based on [[Jesus]]'s amen to \"be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48). This ideal, also called the [[state of perfection]], can be seen, for example, in the ''[[Philokalia]]'', a book of monastic writings. Their manner of self-renunciation has three elements corresponding to the three [[evangelical counsels]]: [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]].\n\n==History==\n===Biblical precedent===\nFirst-century groups such as the [[Essenes]] and the [[Therapeutae]] followed lifestyles that could be seen as precursors to Christian monasticism.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', describes Philo's Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks. Professor Constantine Scouteris, [http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/patrology/scouteris_theraputae.htm Source]</ref> Early Christian monasticism drew its inspiration from the examples of the Prophet [[Elijah]] and [[John the Baptist]], who both lived alone in the desert, and above all from the story of Jesus\u2019 time in solitary struggle with Satan in the desert, before his public ministry.<ref name=ocso>[http://www.ocso.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=150&Itemid=182&lang=en \"Early Christian Monasticism\", Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance]</ref> \n\n===Early Christianity===\n[[File:Saint Anthony The Great.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of [[Saint Anthony the Great]], the founder of Christian monasticism]]\n{{Main|Christian monasticism before 451}}\nEarly Christian ascetics have left no confirmed archaeological traces and only hints in the written record. Communities of virgins who had consecrated themselves to Christ are found at least as far back as the 2nd century. There were also individual ascetics, known as the \"devout\", who usually lived not in the deserts but on the edge of inhabited places, still remaining in the world but practicing asceticism and striving for union with God. In ante-Nicene ascetics a man would lead a single life, practice long and frequent fasts, abstain from meat and wine, and support himself, if he were able, by some small handicraft, keeping of what he earned only so much as was absolutely necessary for his own sustenance, and giving the rest to the poor.<ref name=bacchus/>\n\nAn early form of \"proto-monasticism\" appeared as well in the 3rd century among [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] through the \"[[Sons of the covenant]]\" movement. [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] looks to [[Basil the Great|Basil of Caesarea]] as a founding monastic legislator, as well to as the example of the [[Desert Fathers]].\n\n====Eremitic Monasticism====\n{{Main|Hermit}}\nEremitic monasticism, or solitary monasticism, is characterized by a complete withdrawal from society. The word \u2018eremitic\u2019 comes from the Greek word eremos which means desert.<ref name=\"Idiorrythmic Monasticism\">{{cite web |title=Idiorrythmic Monasticism|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/281997/idiorrhythmic-monasticism|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>  This name was given because of St. Anthony of Egypt, who left civilization behind to live on a solitary Egyptian mountain in the third century.

In the 3rd century, [[Anthony of Egypt]] (252\u2013356) lived as a hermit in the desert and gradually gained followers who lived as hermits nearby but not in actual community with him. This type of monasticism is called '''eremitical''' or \"hermit-like\".\n\nAnother option for becoming a solitary monastic was to become an anchoress. This began because there were women who wanted to live the solitary lifestyle but were not able to live alone in the wild. Thus they would go to the Bishop for permission who would then perform the rite of enclosure. After this was completed the anchoress would live alone in a room that typically had a window that opened into a church so they could receive communion and participate in church services. There were two other windows that allowed food to be passed in and people to come seek advice.<ref name=Anchoress>{{cite web |title=Anchoress|url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/anchoress.htm|work=The Middle Ages Website|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>  The most well known anchoress was [[Julian of Norwich]] who was born in England in 1342.<ref name=\"Juliana of Norwich\">{{cite web |last=Gardner|first=Edmund|title=Juliana of Norwich|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08557a.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopaedia Vol. 8|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Cenobitic monasticism====\n{{Main|Cenobitic monasticism}}\nWhile the earliest Desert Fathers lived as hermits, they were rarely completely isolated, but often lived in proximity to one another, and soon loose-knit communities began to form in such places as the Desert of Nitria and the Desert of Skete.<ref name=ocso/> [[Macarius of Egypt|Saint Macarius]] established individual groups of cells such as those at [[Kellia]] (founded in 328.) These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only.<ref name=greek>[http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 \"Monasticism\", Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, Nassau, Bahamas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025155947/http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 |date=25 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 346 [[St Pachomius]] established in Egypt the first cenobitic Christian monastery.<ref name=ocso/> At [[Tabenna]] in Upper [[Egypt]], sometime around 323 AD, Pachomius decided to mold his disciples into a more organized community in which the monks lived in individual huts or rooms (''cellula'' in [[Latin]],) but worked, ate, and worshipped in shared space. The intention was to bring together individual ascetics who, although pious, did not, like Saint Anthony, have the physical ability or skills to live a solitary existence in the desert. This method of monastic organization is called '''cenobitic''' or \"communal\". In Catholic theology, this community-based living is considered superior because of the obedience practiced and the accountability offered. The head of a monastery came to be known by the word for \"Father\"\u2014in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], ''Abba''; in English, \"[[Abbot]]\".\n\nGuidelines for daily life were created, and separate monasteries were created for men and women. St Pachomius introduced a monastic Rule of cenobitic life, giving everyone the same food and attire. The monks of the monastery fulfilled the obediences assigned them for the common good of the monastery. Among the various obediences was copying books. St Pachomius considered that an obedience fulfilled with zeal was greater than fasting or prayer.<ref name=oca>[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/05/15/101384-venerable-pachomius-the-great-founder-of-coenobitic-monasticism \"Venerable Pachomius the Great, Founder of Coenobitic Monasticism\", Orthodox Church in America]</ref>\n\nA Pachomian monastery was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The monks were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty monks. There would be thirty to forty houses in a monastery. There was an abbot over each monastery, and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The monks were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division seem to have been employed, e.g., there was a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and Sundays all the monks assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses.<ref name=bacchus/>\n\nFrom a secular point of view, a monastery was an industrial community in which almost every kind of trade was practised. This, of course, involved much buying and selling, so the monks had ships of their own on the Nile, which conveyed their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and brought back what the monasteries required. From the spiritual point of view, the Pachomian monk was a religious living under a rule.<ref name=bacchus>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10464a.htm Bacchus, Francis Joseph. \"Eastern Monasticism Before Chalcedon (A.D. 451)\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''. Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 31 May 2013]</ref>\n\nThe community of Pachomius was so successful he was called upon to help organize others, and by one count by the time he died in 346 there were thought to be 3,000 such communities dotting Egypt, especially in the [[Thebaid]]. From there monasticism quickly spread out first to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Judean Desert]], [[Syria]], [[North Africa]] and eventually the rest of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 370 Basil the Great, monastic founder in Cappadocia, became bishop of Caesarea and wrote principles of ascetic life. Eastern monastic teachings were brought to the western church by Saint John Cassian (c. 360 \u2013 c. 435).  As a young adult, he and his friend Germanus entered a monastery in Palestine but then journeyed to Egypt to visit the eremitic groups in Nitria. Many years later, Cassian founded a monastery of monks and probably also one of nuns near Marseilles. He wrote two long works, the ''Institutes'' and ''Conferences''. In these books he not only transmitted his Egyptian experience but also gave Christian monasticism a profound evangelical and theological basis.<ref name=ocso/>\n\nAt the time of his conversion in Milan in the years 386\u2013387, Augustine was aware of the life of Saint Anthony in the desert of Egypt. Upon his return to Africa as a Christian in the year 388, however, Augustine and a few Christian friends founded at Thagaste a lay community. They became cenobites in the countryside rather than in the desert.<ref name=augnet>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&iparentid=1112 \"Monasticism\", Augnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012002816/http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&iparentid=1112 |date=12 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSaint Benedict (c. 480 \u2013 547 AD) lived for many years as a hermit in a cave near Subiaco, Italy. He was asked to be head over several monks who wished to change to the monastic style of Pachomius by living in community. Between the years 530 and 560, he wrote the Rule of Saint Benedict as a guideline for monks living in community.<ref name=augnet/>\n\nScholars such as [[Lester K. Little]] attribute the rise of monasticism at this time to the immense changes in the church brought about by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s legalization of Christianity. The subsequent transformation of Christianity into the main Roman religion ended the position of Christians as a minority sect. In response a new form of dedication was developed. The long-term \"martyrdom\" of the ascetic replaced the violent physical [[martyrdom]] of the [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions]].\n\n==Eastern Orthodox tradition==\n[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|200px|Right|''Analavos'' worn by Eastern Orthodox Schema-Monks.]]\n{{See also|Monk#Eastern Christianity}} {{Main|Eastern Christian monasticism}}\nOrthodox monasticism does not have religious orders as in the West,<ref>One may hear Orthodox monks referred to as \"Basilian Monks\", but this is really an inappropriate application of western categories to Orthodoxy.</ref> so there are no formal Monastic Rules (''Regulae''); rather, each monk and [[Nun#Eastern Orthodox Christian|nun]] is encouraged to read all of the [[Saints|Holy Fathers]] and emulate their virtues. There is also no division between the \"active\" and \"contemplative\" life. [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] monastic life embraces both active and contemplative aspects.\n\nWithin the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], there exist three types of monasticism: eremitic, cenobitic, and the [[skete]]. The skete is a very small community, often of two or three ({{bibleverse||Matthew|18:20}}), under the direction of an [[Starets|Elder]]. They pray privately for most of the week, then come together on Sundays and Feast Days for communal prayer, thus combining aspects of both eremitic and coenobitic monasticism.\n\n===Historical development===\nEven before Saint [[Anthony the Great]] (the \"father of monasticism\") went out into the desert, there were Christians who devoted their lives to ascetic discipline and striving to lead an evangelical life (i.e., in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel).\nAs monasticism spread in the East from the hermits living in the deserts of Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and on up into [[Asia Minor]] and beyond, the sayings (''apophthegmata'') and acts (''praxeis'') of the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] came to be recorded and circulated, first among their fellow monastics and then among the laity as well.\n\nAmong these earliest recorded accounts was the ''Paradise,'' by [[Palladius of Galatia]], [[Bishop of Helenopolis]] (also known as the ''[[Lausiac History]]'', after the [[prefect]] Lausus, to whom it was addressed). Saint [[Athanasius]] of Alexandria (whose ''Life of [[Saint Anthony the Great]]'' set the pattern for monastic [[hagiography]]), Saint [[Jerome]], and other anonymous compilers were also responsible for setting down very influential accounts. Also of great importance are the writings surrounding the communities founded by Saint Pachomius, the father of [[cenobite|cenobiticism]], and his disciple Saint Theodore, the founder of the skete form of monasticism.\n\nAmong the first to set forth precepts for the monastic life was Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], a man from a professional family who was educated in [[Caesarea]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Athens]]. Saint Basil visited colonies of hermits in Palestine and Egypt but was most strongly impressed by the organized communities developed under the guidance of Saint Pachomius. Saint Basil's ascetical writings set forth standards for well-disciplined community life and offered lessons in what became the ideal monastic virtue: humility.\n\nSaint Basil wrote a series of guides for monastic life (the ''Lesser Asketikon'' the ''Greater Asketikon'' the ''Morals'', etc.) which, while not \"Rules\" in the legalistic sense of later Western rules, provided firm indications of the importance of a single community of monks, living under the same roof, and under the guidance\u2014and even discipline\u2014of a strong abbot. His teachings set the model for Greek and Russian monasticism but had less influence in the Latin West.\n\nOf great importance to the development of monasticism is the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Here the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] was written by Saint [[John Climacus]] (c.600), a work of such importance that many Orthodox monasteries to this day read it publicly either during the [[Canonical Hours|Divine Services]] or in [[Refectory|Trapeza]] during [[Great Lent]].\n\nAt the height of the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] Empire, numerous great monasteries were established by the emperors, including the twenty \"sovereign monasteries\" on the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]],<ref>Both Mount Sinai and Mount Athos are referred to as \"the Holy Mountain\" in Orthodox literature,</ref> an actual \"monastic republic\" wherein the entire country is devoted to bringing souls closer to God. In this milieu, the [[Philokalia]] was compiled.\n\nAs the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] between East and West grew, conflict arose over misunderstandings about [[Hesychasm]]. Saint [[Gregory Palamas]], bishop of [[Thessalonica]], an experienced Athonite monk, defended Orthodox spirituality against the attacks of [[Barlaam of Calabria]], and left numerous important works on the spiritual life.\n\n[[File:Konstantin Savitskiy Inok 1897.jpg|thumbnail|[[Konstantin Savitsky]], monk 1897]]\n\n===Present===\nChristian monasticism was and continued to be a lay condition\u2014monks depended on a local parish church for the [[sacraments]]. However, if the monastery was isolated in the desert, as were many of the Egyptian examples, that inconvenience compelled monasteries either to take in priest members, to have their abbot or other members ordained. A priest-monk is sometimes called a [[hieromonk]]. In many cases in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], when a [[Diocese|bishopric]] needed to be filled, they would look to nearby monasteries to find suitable candidates, being good sources of men who were spiritually mature and generally possessing the other qualities desired in a bishop. Eventually, among the Orthodox Churches it became established by [[canon law]] that all bishops must be monks.\n\nMonastic centers thrive to this day in [[Bulgaria]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], the [[Holy Land]], and elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the [[Mount Athos|Autonomous Monastic State of Mount Athos]] remaining the spiritual center of monasticism for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], a great renaissance of monasticism has occurred, and many previously empty or destroyed monastic communities have been reopened.\n\nMonasticism continues to be very influential in the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the [[Canon Law#Orthodox Churches|Sacred Canons]], all Bishops must be monks (not merely celibate), and feast days to [[Canonization|Glorified]] monastic saints are an important part of the liturgical tradition of the church. [[Fasting]], Hesychasm, and the pursuit of the spiritual life are strongly encouraged not only among monastics but also among the laity.\n\n===Types of monks===\n{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}\n[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-39.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orthodox monks farming potatoes in [[Russia]], c. 1910]]\n\nThere are also three levels of monks: The Rassophore, the Stavrophore, and the Schema-Monk (or Schema-Nun). Each of the three degrees represents an increased level of asceticism. In the early days of monasticism, there was only one level\u2014the Great Schema\u2014and even Saint [[Theodore the Studite]] argued against the establishment of intermediate grades, but nonetheless the consensus of the church has favored the development of three distinct levels.\n\nWhen a candidate wishes to embrace the monastic life, he will enter the monastery of his choice as a guest and ask to be received by the [[Hegumen]] (Abbot). After a period of at least three days the Hegumen may at his discretion clothe the candidate as a [[novice]]. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) would simply be given the [[cassock#Eastern practice .28Orthodox and Eastern Catholic.29|''Podraznik'']], belt and ''[[skoufos]]''.\n\nAfter a period of about three years, the Hegumen may at his discretion [[tonsure]] the novice as a ''Rassophore'' monk, giving him the outer garment called the Rassa (Greek: ''Rason''). A monk (or nun) may remain in this grade all the rest of his life, if he so chooses. But the Rite of Tonsure for the Rassophore refers to the grade as that of the \"Beginner\", so it is intended that the monk will advance on to the next level. The Rassophore is also given a [[klobuk]] which he wears in church and on formal occasions. In addition, Rassophores will be given a [[prayer rope]] at their tonsure.\n\nThe next rank, ''Stavrophore'', is the grade that most Russian monks remain all their lives. The title Stavrophore means \"cross-bearer\", because when Tonsured into this grade the monastic is given a cross to wear at all times. This cross is called a Paramand\u2014a wooden cross attached by ribbons to a square cloth embroidered with the [[Passion (Christianity)#Instruments of the Passion|Instruments of the Passion]] and the words, \"I bear upon my body the marks of the Lord Jesus\" ({{bibleverse||Galatians|6:17}}). The Paramand is so called because it is worn under the [[Mantle (vesture)|Mantle]] (Greek: ''Mandyas''; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Mantya''), which is a long cape which completely covers the monk from neck to foot. Among the Russians, Stavrophores are also informally referred to as \"mantle monks\". At his Tonsure, a Stavrophore is given a wooden hand cross and a lit candle, as well as a prayer rope.\n\n[[File:St Anthony of Kiev.jpg|thumb|300px|left|St. [[Anthony of Kiev]] wearing the Great Schema.]]\nThe highest rank of monasticism is the ''Great Schema'' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos''; Church Slavonic: ''Schimnik''). Attaining the level of ''Schema monk'' is much more common among the Greeks than it is among the Russians, for whom it is normally reserved to hermits, or to very advanced monastics. The ''Schema monk'' or ''Schema nun'' wears the same habit as the Rassophore, but to it is added the ''Analavos'' (Church Slavonic: ''Analav''), a garment shaped like a cross, covering the shoulders and coming down to the knees (or lower) in front and in back. This garment is roughly reminiscent of the [[scapular]] worn by some Roman Catholic orders, but it is finely embroidered with the Cross and instruments of the Passion (see illustration, above). The Klobuk worn by a Schema monk is also embroidered with a red cross and other symbols. the Klobuk may be shaped differently, more rounded at the top, in which case it is referred to as a ''koukoulion''. The skufia worn by a Schema monk is also more intricately embroidered.\n\nThe [[religious habit]] worn by Orthodox monastics is the same for both monks and nuns, except that the nuns wear an additional veil, called an ''[[apostolnik]]''.\n\nThe central and unifying feature of Orthodox monasticism is [[Hesychasm]], the practice of silence, and the concentrated saying of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. All ascetic practices and monastic humility is guided towards preparing the heart for [[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Church|''theoria'']] or the \"divine vision\" that comes from the union of the soul with God. Such union is not accomplished by any human activity. All an ascetic can do is prepare the ground; it is for God to cause the seed to grow and bear fruit.\n\n==Western Christian monasticism==\n===History===\nThe introduction of monasticism into the West may be dated from about A.D. 340 when St. Athanasius visited Rome accompanied by the two Egyptian monks Ammon and Isidore, disciples of St. Anthony. The publication of the \"Vita Antonii\" some years later and its translation into Latin spread the knowledge of Egyptian monachism widely and many were found in Italy to imitate the example thus set forth. The first Italian monks aimed at reproducing exactly what was done in Egypt and not a few\u2014such as St. Jerome, Rufinus, Paula, Eustochium and the two Melanias\u2014actually went to live in Egypt or Palestine as being better suited to monastic life than Italy.<ref name=huddleston/>\n\nThe earliest phases of monasticism in Western Europe involved figures like [[Martin of Tours]], who after serving in the Roman legions converted to Christianity and established a hermitage near [[Milan]], then moved on to [[Poitiers]] where a community gathered around his hermitage. He was called to become [[Bishop of Tours]] in 372, where he established a monastery at [[Marmoutiers]] on the opposite bank of the [[Loire River]], a few miles upstream from the city. His cell was a hut of wood, and round it his disciples, who soon numbered eighty, dwelt in caves and huts. His monastery was laid out as a colony of hermits rather than as a single integrated community. The type of life was simply the Antonian monachism of Egypt.<ref name=huddleston/>\n\n[[Honoratus of Marseilles]] was a wealthy [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, who after a pilgrimage to Egypt, founded the [[L\u00e9rins Abbey|Monastery of L\u00e9rins]] in 410, on an island lying off the modern city of [[Cannes]]. The monastery combined a community with isolated hermitages where older, spiritually-proven monks could live in isolation. L\u00e9rins became, in time, a center of monastic culture and learning, and many later monks and bishops would pass through L\u00e9rins in the early stages of their career.<ref name=Gilbert>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10472a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. \"Western Monasticism.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10.

In Egypt he had been attracted to the isolated life of hermits, which he considered the highest form of monasticism, yet the monasteries he founded were all organized monastic communities. About 415 he established two monasteries near [[Marseilles]],<ref name=Gilbert/> one for men, one for women. In time these attracted a total of 5,000 monks and nuns. Most significant for the future development of monasticism were Cassian's ''Institutes'', which provided a guide for monastic life and his ''Conferences'', a collection of spiritual reflections.\n\n====Celtic monasticism====\nIt seems that the first Celtic monasteries were merely settlements where the Christians lived together\u2014priests and laity, men, women, and children alike\u2014as a kind of religious clan.<ref name=Gilbert/> According to James F.

The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Successive abbots and abbesses were members of the founder's family, a policy which kept the monastic lands under the jurisdiction of the family (and corresponded to Irish legal tradition, which only allowed the transfer of land within a family).\nIn Ireland, the abbot was often called \"coarb\", a term designating the heir of successor of the founder.<ref name=Addleshaw/>\n\nThe abbots of the principal monasteries\u2014 such as Clonard, Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Swords, etc.\u2014were of the highest rank and held in the greatest esteem.

The abbot was superior of the house, and all were subject to him.<ref name=ohalloran/>\n\nThe Irish rule was rigorous. It was more or less a copy of the French rule, as the French was a copy of the Thebaid. The daily routine of monastic life was prayer, study, and manual labor. With regard to food the rule was very strict. Only one meal a day, at 3 o'clock p.m., was allowed, except on Sundays and Feast days. Wednesdays and Fridays were fast days, except the interval between Easter and Whit Sunday. The food allowed was barley bread, milk, fish, and eggs. Flesh meat was not allowed except on great feasts.<ref name=ohalloran>[http://www.libraryireland.com/WestCorkHistory/Monasteries.php O'Halloran, W., ''Early Irish History and Antiquities and the History of West Cork'', Chapter XI, 1916]</ref>\n\nIn Ireland a distinctive form of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penance]] developed, where confession was made privately to a priest, under the seal of secrecy, and where penance was given privately and ordinarily performed privately as well.<ref>''Medieval Handbooks of Penance'', eds.

Saints' lives frequently tell of monks (and abbots) departing some distance from the monastery to live in isolation from the community. Irish monastic rules specify a stern life of prayer and discipline in which prayer, poverty, and obedience are the central themes.\n\nIrish monks needed to learn Latin, the language of the Church. Thus they read Latin texts, both spiritual and secular, with an enthusiasm that their contemporaries on the continent lacked. Subjects taught included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, arithmetic, chronology, the Holy Places, hymns, sermons, natural science, history and especially the interpretation of Sacred Scripture.<ref name=ohalloran/> In 544 [[Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise|St Ciar\u00e1n]] founded a monastery at [[Clonmacnoise]], which became one of the most important centres of learning and religious life in Ireland.  Contrary to common practice, the title of abbot {{ndash}} which included the title \"[[Comarba]] of Saint Ciar\u00e1n\" {{ndash}} at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. In 557 [[Brendan|St Brendan]] founded a monastery at Clonfert.\n\nBy the end of the seventh century, Irish [[monastic school]]s were attracting students from England and from Europe.\n\nThe achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art. The manuscripts were produced by and for monasteries, and evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops.<ref>\"'The Work of Angels', Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork\", (Susan Youngs, ed.) London: British Museum Press. 1989, {{ISBN|0-7141-0554-6}}</ref>\n\n==== Culdees ====\n{{Main|Culdees}}\n\n==== Hiberno-Scottish mission ====\nIrish monasticism spread widely, first to [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]], then to Gaul and Italy. [[Columba]] and his followers established monasteries at [[Bangor Abbey|Bangor]], on the northeastern coast of Ireland, at [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], an island north-west of Scotland, and at [[Lindisfarne]], which was founded by Aidan, an Irish monk from Iona, at the request of King [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Abbots of Iona were normally appointed from the founders kin, with an abbot often naming hhis successor.<ref name=Addleshaw/>\n\n[[Columbanus]], an abbot from a Leinster noble family, traveled to Gaul in the late 6th century with twelve companions. Columbanus and his followers spread the Irish model of monastic institutions to the continent. A whole series of new monastic foundations under Irish influence sprang up, starting with Columbanus's foundations of [[Luxeuil]] and [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Luxeuil]] and, sponsored by the Frankish King [[Childebert II]]. After Childebert's death Columbanus traveled east to Metz, where Theudebert II allowed him to establish a new monastery among the semi-pagan [[Alemanni]] in what is now [[Switzerland]]. One of Columbanus's followers founded the monastery of St. Gall on the shores of Lake Constance, while Columbanus continued onward across the [[Alps]] to the kingdom of the [[Lombards]] in Italy. There King [[Agilulf]] and his wife [[Theodolinda]] granted Columbanus land in the mountains between [[Genoa]] and Milan, where he established the monastery of [[Bobbio]]. From about 698 until the reign of Charlemagne in the 770s, the Hiberno-Scottish efforts in the Frankish Empire were continued by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]. The rule of St. Columbanus, which was originally followed in most of these monasteries, was eventually superseded by that of St. Benedict.\n\n====Benedictine monasticism====\n[[File:Heiligenkreuz.St. Benedict.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Saint Benedict]] by Herman Nieg, Heiligenkreuz Abbey, Austria]]\n\n[[Benedict of Nursia]] is the most influential of Western monks and is called \"the Father of Western Monasticism\". He was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], outside the city.  He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] around 520, between Rome and [[Naples]]. He established the [[Rule of St Benedict]], adapting in part the earlier anonymous [[Rule of the Master]] (''Regula magistri''), which was written somewhere south of Rome around 500, and defined the activities of the monastery, its officers, and their responsibilities. By the ninth century, largely under the inspiration of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]], Benedict's Rule became the basic guide for Western monasticism.\n\nWhile the Celtic monasteries had a stronger connection to the semi-eremitical tradition of Egypt via L\u00e9rins and Tours, Benedict and his followers were more influenced by the cenobitism of St [[Pachomius]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]]. Early Benedictine monasteries were relatively small and consisted of an oratory, refectory, dormitory, scriptorium, guest accommodation and out-buildings, a group of often quite separate rooms more reminiscent of a decent sized Roman villa than a large medieval abbey. A monastery of about a dozen monks would have been normal during this period.\n\nMedieval monastic life consisted of prayer, reading, and manual labor.<ref>[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/medieval-monastery.htm Middle-ages.org.uk]</ref> Prayer was a monk's first priority. Apart from prayer, monks performed a variety of tasks, such as preparing medicine, lettering, reading, and others. Also, these monks would work in the gardens and on the land. They might also spend time in the cloister, a covered colonnade around a courtyard, where they would pray or read.  Some monasteries held a scriptorium where monks would write or copy books. When the monks wrote, they used very neat handwriting and would [[Illuminated manuscript|draw illustrations in the books]] and decorate the first letter of each paragraph.\n\nThe efficiency of Benedict's cenobitic Rule in addition to the stability of the monasteries made them very productive. The monasteries were the central storehouses and producers of knowledge.  Vikings started attacking Irish monasteries famous for learning in 793. One monk wrote about how he did not mind the bad weather one evening because it kept the Vikings from coming: \"Bitter is the wind tonight, it tosses the ocean\u2019s white hair, I need not fear\u2014as on a night of calm sea\u2014the fierce raiders from Lochlann.\"<ref>Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times. London: Jarrold and Sons Ltd., 1968, page 114</ref>\n\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries the growing pressure of monarchies and the nation states undermined the wealth and power of the orders. Monasticism continued to play a role in Catholicism, but after the [[Protestant reformation]] many monasteries in Northern Europe [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|were shut down]] and their assets seized.\n\n===Military orders===\nIn the twelfth century, traditional monastic orders in [[Outremer]] evolved into military orders, initially for the purpose of defending pilgrims, although they later became larger military forces that played a key role in combating Muslim efforts at reconquest and propping up continued Christian rule in the region. These orders included the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Hospitallers]]. In large part, the notion of military monasticism became so popular because of the advocacy of [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]], who believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church's ends in war were inadequate, and that a group of dedicated warrior monks, who achieved spiritual merit and served God through waging war, was necessary. In his view, advancing the cause of Christendom was an end that justified means that might fall outside the bounds of [[just war]]. <ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 75.</ref> \n\nThese orders largely declined with the loss of Outremer in the 1200s - except for the [[Teutonic Order]], which transferred itself to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] where it took up a major role in the [[Baltic Crusades]]. In the Baltic, warrior monks used massacre and forced conversion to compel the submission of local pagan tribes, which disliked the Order's rule and rebelled repeatedly. They also enslaved members of defeated tribes, sometimes refusing to permit them to be baptized in order to keep them in a state of enslavement (which was theologically justifiable only against non-Christians). <ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 88</ref>\n\n===Western Christian orders in the modern era===\nMany distinct monastic orders developed within [[Roman Catholic religious order|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Monastic communities in the West, broadly speaking, are organized into orders and congregations guided by a particular religious rule, such as the [[Rule of St Augustine]] or especially [[Rule of St Benedict]]. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have a system of orders per se, though some of the Eastern Catholic Churches do.\n\n====Roman Catholicism====\n{{canon law}}\n{{Main|Roman Catholic religious order}}\n\n* [[Benedictine]]s, founded in 529 by Benedict at [[Monte Cassino]], stresses manual labor in a self-subsistent monastery.

This movement is largely considered [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or Lutheran in its roots.\n\nIn 1948 [[Bavaria]]n Lutheran pastor Walter H\u00fcmmer and his wife Hanna founded the [[Communit\u00e4t Christusbruderschaft Selbitz]].\n\nIn other Lutheran traditions \"The Congregation of the Servants of Christ\" was established at [[St. Augustine's House]]<ref>[http://www.staugustineshouse.org Saint Augustine's House]</ref> in [[Oxford, Michigan]], in 1958 when some other men joined Father [[Arthur Kreinheder]] in observing the monastic life and offices of prayer. These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur. During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there are two permanent professed members and two long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[\u00d6stanb\u00e4ck Monastery]])<ref>[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm \u00d6stanb\u00e4ck monastery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813114047/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm |date=13 August 2011 }}</ref> and in Germany the ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).<ref>[http://www.wigberti.de Priorat St. Wigberti: Unser Kloster]</ref> In Germany, [[Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring]]<ref>[http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911174924/http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> is a Lutheran Benedictine community for women.  In 2011, an Augustinian religious order, the Priestly Society of St. Augustine (Societas Sacerdotalis Sancti Augustini) was established by the [[Anglo-Lutheran Catholic Church]].  It follows the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], its headquarters is at Christ Lutheran Church ALCC. Kent Island, Maryland, and Fr. Jens Bargmann, Ph.D., is the Grand Prior.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161219073059/http://www.sssa-us.org/Home_Page.html Priestly Society of St. Augustine]</ref>\n\nIn Lutheran [[Sweden]], religious life for women had been established already in 1954, when Sister Marianne Nordstr\u00f6m made her profession through contacts with The [[Order of the Holy Paraclete]] and Mother Margaret Cope (1886\u20131961) at St Hilda's Priory, [[Whitby]], Yorkshire.\n\n====Anglican Communion====\n{{Main|Anglican religious order}}\nIn England, [[John Wycliffe]], organized the [[Lollard]] Preacher Order (the \"Poor Priests\") to promote his views, many of which resounded with those held by the later Protestant Reformers.\n\nMonastic life in England came to an abrupt end with [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]. The property and lands of the [[monastery|monasteries]] were confiscated and either retained by the King, sold to landowners, or given to loyal [[nobility]]. [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were pensioned off and retired or some were forced to either flee for the continent or to abandon their vocations. For around 300 years, there were no monastic communities within any of the [[Anglican]] churches.\n\nShortly after the [[Oxford Movement]] began to advocate restoring [[catholic]] faith and practice to the [[Church of England]] (see [[Anglo-Catholicism]]), there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. Anglican [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]] in the 1840s while he was vicar of [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]]. From then forward, there have been many communities of [[monk]]s, [[friar]]s, sisters, and [[nun]]s established within the [[Anglican Communion]]. In 1848, Mother [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] founded the Anglican Sisters of Charity and became the first woman to take religious vows within the [[Anglican Communion]] since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. In October 1850 the first building specifically built for the purpose of housing an [[Sisterhoods (Modern Anglican)|Anglican Sisterhood]] was consecrated at Abbeymere in [[Plymouth]]. It housed several schools for the destitute, a laundry, printing press and soup kitchen. From the 1840s and throughout the following one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated in the UK and the United States, as well as in various countries of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Canada]], India and the [[Pacific]].\n\nSome Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called \"mixed life\", a combination of a life of contemplative prayer with active service. Anglican religious life closely mirrors that of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Like Roman Catholic religious, Anglican religious also take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Religious communities live together under a common rule, reciting the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Eucharist]] daily.\n\nIn the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic movement]] was at its height, the [[Anglican Communion]] had hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion, most notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in religious communities around the world. While vocations remain few in some areas, Anglican religious communities are experiencing exponential growth in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]].\n\nAround 1964, Reuben Archer Torrey III, an Episcopal missionary, grandson of [[Reuben Archer Torrey|R. A. Torrey]], founded Jesus Abbey as a missionary community in [[Korea]]. It has some links with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and holds an [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical doctrine]].\n\n====Methodist Churches====\nIn February 2001, the [[United Methodist Church]] organized the [[Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery]]. It is a Methodist-Benedictine residential [[double monastery]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]]. Besides monastic orders, the [[Order of Saint Luke]] is a dispersed religious order within Methodism.\n\n====Presbyterian Churches====\nThe Community of the Sisterhood Emmanuel was founded in 1973 in Makak - in the Centre Province by Mother Marie, one of the first female Pastors of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon. In 1975 she moved the community to the present site- at Agyati in Bafut.  It has 10 finally consecrated Sisters, four in simple vows and a handful of others in formation.  The Sisters are trained in strong collaboration with the sister Institutes of the Catholic Church. They say that one of their charisms is ecumenism. The Sisterhood Emmanuel is the only Presbyterian Monastery in Cameroon.\n\n====Anabaptism====\n[[Anabaptist]] Christians \"retained many elements of the monastic understanding of a 'holy life' that followed true faith\".<ref name=\"RedekopKrahn1994\">{{cite book|last1=Redekop|first1=Calvin Wall|last2=Krahn|first2=Victor A.|last3=Steiner|first3=Samuel J.|title=Anabaptist/Mennonite Faith and Economics|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|language=English|isbn=9780819193506|page=15}}</ref> The [[Hutterites]] and [[Bruderhof]], for example, live in intentional communities with their big houses having \"ground floors for common work, meals and worship, the two-storey attics with small rooms, like monastic cells, for married couples\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Quakerism and Shakerism====\nThe [[Shakers]], who are also known as the \"Shaking Quakers\", have been characterized as a \"Protestant monastic order providing refuge and otherworldly compensation\".<ref name=\"Hammond1985\">{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Phillip E.|title=The Sacred in a Secular Age: Toward Revision in the Scientific Study of Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredinseculara00hamm|url-access=registration|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|language=English |isbn=9780520053434|page=[https://archive.org/details/sacredinseculara00hamm/page/28 28]}}</ref> They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, [[pacifism]], and their model of [[equality of the sexes]], which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s.

Although he was partly inspired by the hope of reviving monasticism in the Protestant tradition, the brotherhood was interdenominational, accepting Roman Catholic brothers, and is thus an ecumenical rather than a specifically Protestant community.\n\nThe [[Order of Ecumenical Franciscans]] is a religious order of men and women devoted to following the examples of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare of Assisi in their life and understanding of the Christian gospel: sharing a love for creation and those who have been marginalized. It includes members of many different denominations, including Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and a range of Protestant traditions. The Order understands its charism to include not only ecumenical efforts and the traditional emphases of the Franciscans in general, but also to help to develop relationships between the various Franciscan orders.\n\nAdditional expressions of ecumenical monasticism can be seen in the [[Bose Monastic Community]] and communities of the [[New Monasticism]] movement arising from Protestant Evangelicalism.\n\nIn 1999 an independent Protestant order was founded named [[The Knights of Prayer Monastic Order]]. The community maintains several monks in its [[Portland, Oregon]], cloister and has an international network of associated lay people. It is not affiliated with any particular congregation.\n\n==Contributions==\n[[File:ZCHronsk\u00fdSv\u00e4t\u00fdBe\u0148adikKostol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A monastery in [[Hronsk\u00fd Be\u0148adik]] ([[Slovakia]]).]]\nIn traditional Catholic societies, monastic communities often took charge of social services such as [[education]] and [[healthcare]]. The legacy of monasteries outside remains an important current in modern society. [[Max Weber]] compared the closeted and [[Puritan]] societies of the [[English Dissenters]], who sparked much of the [[industrial revolution]], to monastic orders. Many [[Utopianism|Utopian]] thinkers (starting with [[Thomas More]]) felt inspired by the common life of monks to apply it to the whole society (an example is the [[phalanst\u00e8re]]). Modern [[universities]] have also attempted to emulate Christian monasticism. Even in the [[Americas]], universities are built in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style of twelfth century monasteries. Communal meals, dormitory residences, elaborate rituals and dress all borrow heavily from the monastic tradition. Today monasticism remains an important part of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican faiths.\n\n===Education===\nThe capitulary of 789 reads: \"Let every monastery and every abbey have its school, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar\". There can be no doubt that by boys are meant not only the candidates for the monastery and the wards (generally the children of nobles) committed to the care of the monks, but also the children of the village or country district around the monastery, for whom there was usually an external school attached to groups of monastic buildings.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03349c.htm Turner, William. \"Carolingian Schools.\"] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 February 2015</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, monasteries conserved and copied ancient manuscripts in their [[scriptorium|scriptoria]]. A prospective monk first learned grammar, logic, and oratory. Later, he would take up mathematics, astronomy, and music. The students would use a stylus on wax. Later, when their handwriting improved, they would be given ink and parchment. Eventually, many of those schools became universities.<ref>[http://historymedren.about.com/cs/monasticism/a/keepers_2.htm Historymedrend.about.com]</ref> Monks in scriptoria copied texts of Greece and Rome, as well as religious texts, and kept these manuscripts from being lost during the Middle Ages.\n\n===Medicine===\n[[File:Soutra Aisle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A Picture of the Hospital of [[Soutra Aisle]].|The Hospital at [[Soutra Aisle]].]] Monastic [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] stored and studied [[medicament]]s. Some of the works that the monks copied were by medical writers, and reading and copying these works helped create a store of medical knowledge. Monasteries had infirmaries to treat the monks, travelers, the poor, old, weak and sick. In 2005, archeologists uncovered waste at [[Soutra Aisle]] which helped scientists figure out how people in the Middle Ages treated certain diseases, such as scurvy; because of the vitamin C in watercress, patients would eat it to stop their teeth from falling out. The same archeological group discovered hemlock, a known pain killer, in the drains of the hospital.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3745498.stm | work=BBC News | title=The medical world of medieval monks | date=6 August 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nMonasteries also aided in the development of agricultural techniques. The requirement of [[wine]] for the Mass led to the development of [[enology|wine culture]], as shown in the discovery of the ''[[m\u00e9thode champenoise]]'' by [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (person)|Dom Perignon]]. Several liquors like ''[[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]]'' and the [[Trappist beer]]s were also developed in monasteries. Even today many monasteries and convents are locally renowned for their cooking specialties.\n\nThe consequence of this centralisation of knowledge was that they initially controlled both public administration and education, where the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] led through the [[quadrivium]] to [[theology]]. Christian monks cultivated the arts as a way of praising God. [[Gregorian chant]] and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] are examples of the practical application of quadrivium subjects.\n\nThe status of monks as apart from secular life (at least theoretically) also served a social function. Dethroned [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kings]] were [[tonsure]]d and sent to a monastery so that they could not claim the crown back. Monasteries became a place for [[second son]]s to live in celibacy so that the family inheritance went to [[primogeniture|the first son]]; in exchange the families donated to the monasteries. Few cities lacked both a St Giles house for lepers outside the walls and a Magdalene house for prostitutes and other women of notoriety within the walls, and some orders were favored by monarchs and rich families to keep and educate their [[maiden]] daughters before [[arranged marriage]].\n\nThe monasteries also provided refuge to those like [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] who retired to [[Yuste]] in his late years, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]], who was functionally as close to a monastic as his regal responsibilities permitted.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asceticism]]\n* ''[[Clasau]]''\u2014the early Welsh monasteries\n* [[Consensoria Monachorum]]\n* [[Coptic monasticism]]\n* [[Hermit]]\n* [[Intentional community]]\n* ''[[Into Great Silence]]''\u2014the award-winning documentary of life within the Carthusian monsastery of La Grande Chartreuse by Philip Groning\n* [[List of monastic houses in England]]\n* [[Mount Athos]]\n* [[New Monasticism]]\n* [[Order of Watchers]]\u2014a French Protestant fraternity of Hermits\n* [[Pachomius]]\u2014an early example of a monastic organizer\n* [[Poustinia]]\n* [[Rule of St Benedict]]\n\n==Notes, references, and sources==\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book |title=Saints and Sinners in Early Christian Ireland: Moral Theology in the Lives of Saints Brigit and Columba |last=Ritari |first=K. |year= 2009 |publisher= Brepols Publishers |location=Turnhout |isbn=978-2-503-53315-5}}\n* {{Cite book |title= Medieval Monasticism |last= Lawrence |first=C.

It began to develop early in the history of the [[Christian Church]], modeled upon scriptural examples and ideals, including those in the [[Old Testament]], but not mandated as an institution in the scriptures. It has come to be regulated by religious rules (e.g. [[the Rule of Saint Augustine]], [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great|St Pachomius]], the [[Rule of St Basil]], the [[Rule of St Benedict]],) and, in modern times, the [[Canon law]] of the respective [[Christian denomination]]s that have forms of monastic living. Those living the monastic life are known by the generic terms [[monk]]s (men) and [[nuns]] (women). The word ''monk'' originated from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|monachos}}, 'monk'), itself from {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|monos}}) meaning  'alone'.<ref>{{OEtymD|monk}}</ref><ref>Corbishley, Mike.Monks lived a very strict and regulated life.

As more people took on the lives of monks, living alone in the wilderness, they started to come together and model themselves after the original monks nearby. Quickly, the monks formed communities to further their ability to observe an [[ascetic]] life.<ref>Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times.

Monastic life is distinct from the \"religious orders\" such as the [[friar]]s, [[canons regular]], [[clerks regular]], and the more recent [[religious congregation]]s. The latter has essentially some special work or aim, such as preaching, teaching, liberating captives, etc., which occupies a large place in their activities. While monks have undertaken labors of the most varied character, in every case this work is extrinsic to the essence of the monastic state.<ref name=huddleston>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10459a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. \"Monasticism.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Christian monastic life does not always involve communal living with like-minded Christians.  Christian monasticism has varied greatly in its external forms, but, broadly speaking, it has two main types (a) the [[eremitical]] or secluded, (b) the [[cenobitical]] or city life. [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony the Abbot]] may be called the founder of the first and [[St. Pachomius]] of the second.<ref name=trappist>[http://www.trappist.net/EarlyMonasticism \"Early Monasticism\", Monastery of the Holy Spirit]</ref> The monastic life is based on [[Jesus]]'s amen to \"be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect\" ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48). This ideal, also called the [[state of perfection]], can be seen, for example, in the ''[[Philokalia]]'', a book of monastic writings. Their manner of self-renunciation has three elements corresponding to the three [[evangelical counsels]]: [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[Vow of obedience|obedience]].\n\n==History==\n===Biblical precedent===\nFirst-century groups such as the [[Essenes]] and the [[Therapeutae]] followed lifestyles that could be seen as precursors to Christian monasticism.<ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'', describes Philo's Therapeutae as the first Christian monks, identifying their renunciation of property, chastity, fasting, solitary lives with the cenobitic ideal of the Christian monks.

Communities of virgins who had consecrated themselves to Christ are found at least as far back as the 2nd century. There were also individual ascetics, known as the \"devout\", who usually lived not in the deserts but on the edge of inhabited places, still remaining in the world but practicing asceticism and striving for union with God. In ante-Nicene ascetics a man would lead a single life, practice long and frequent fasts, abstain from meat and wine, and support himself, if he were able, by some small handicraft, keeping of what he earned only so much as was absolutely necessary for his own sustenance, and giving the rest to the poor.<ref name=bacchus/>\n\nAn early form of \"proto-monasticism\" appeared as well in the 3rd century among [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] through the \"[[Sons of the covenant]]\" movement.

In the 3rd century, [[Anthony of Egypt]] (252\u2013356) lived as a hermit in the desert and gradually gained followers who lived as hermits nearby but not in actual community with him. This type of monasticism is called '''eremitical''' or \"hermit-like\".\n\nAnother option for becoming a solitary monastic was to become an anchoress. This began because there were women who wanted to live the solitary lifestyle but were not able to live alone in the wild. Thus they would go to the Bishop for permission who would then perform the rite of enclosure. After this was completed the anchoress would live alone in a room that typically had a window that opened into a church so they could receive communion and participate in church services. There were two other windows that allowed food to be passed in and people to come seek advice.<ref name=Anchoress>{{cite web |title=Anchoress|url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/anchoress.htm|work=The Middle Ages Website|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>  The most well known anchoress was [[Julian of Norwich]] who was born in England in 1342.<ref name=\"Juliana of Norwich\">{{cite web |last=Gardner|first=Edmund|title=Juliana of Norwich|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08557a.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopaedia Vol. 8|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Cenobitic monasticism====\n{{Main|Cenobitic monasticism}}\nWhile the earliest Desert Fathers lived as hermits, they were rarely completely isolated, but often lived in proximity to one another, and soon loose-knit communities began to form in such places as the Desert of Nitria and the Desert of Skete.<ref name=ocso/> [[Macarius of Egypt|Saint Macarius]] established individual groups of cells such as those at [[Kellia]] (founded in 328.) These monks were anchorites, following the monastic ideal of St. Anthony. They lived by themselves, gathering together for common worship on Saturdays and Sundays only.<ref name=greek>[http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 \"Monasticism\", Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, Nassau, Bahamas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025155947/http://orthodoxbahamas.com/?page_id=986 |date=25 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn 346 [[St Pachomius]] established in Egypt the first cenobitic Christian monastery.<ref name=ocso/> At [[Tabenna]] in Upper [[Egypt]], sometime around 323 AD, Pachomius decided to mold his disciples into a more organized community in which the monks lived in individual huts or rooms (''cellula'' in [[Latin]],) but worked, ate, and worshipped in shared space. The intention was to bring together individual ascetics who, although pious, did not, like Saint Anthony, have the physical ability or skills to live a solitary existence in the desert. This method of monastic organization is called '''cenobitic''' or \"communal\". In Catholic theology, this community-based living is considered superior because of the obedience practiced and the accountability offered. The head of a monastery came to be known by the word for \"Father\"\u2014in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], ''Abba''; in English, \"[[Abbot]]\".\n\nGuidelines for daily life were created, and separate monasteries were created for men and women. St Pachomius introduced a monastic Rule of cenobitic life, giving everyone the same food and attire. The monks of the monastery fulfilled the obediences assigned them for the common good of the monastery. Among the various obediences was copying books. St Pachomius considered that an obedience fulfilled with zeal was greater than fasting or prayer.<ref name=oca>[http://oca.org/saints/lives/2013/05/15/101384-venerable-pachomius-the-great-founder-of-coenobitic-monasticism \"Venerable Pachomius the Great, Founder of Coenobitic Monasticism\", Orthodox Church in America]</ref>\n\nA Pachomian monastery was a collection of buildings surrounded by a wall. The monks were distributed in houses, each house containing about forty monks. There would be thirty to forty houses in a monastery. There was an abbot over each monastery, and provosts with subordinate officials over each house. The monks were divided into houses according to the work they were employed in: thus there would be a house for carpenters, a house for agriculturists, and so forth. But other principles of division seem to have been employed, e.g., there was a house for the Greeks. On Saturdays and Sundays all the monks assembled in the church for Mass; on other days the Office and other spiritual exercises were celebrated in the houses.<ref name=bacchus/>\n\nFrom a secular point of view, a monastery was an industrial community in which almost every kind of trade was practised. This, of course, involved much buying and selling, so the monks had ships of their own on the Nile, which conveyed their agricultural produce and manufactured goods to the market and brought back what the monasteries required. From the spiritual point of view, the Pachomian monk was a religious living under a rule.<ref name=bacchus>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10464a.htm Bacchus, Francis Joseph. \"Eastern Monasticism Before Chalcedon (A.D. 451)\".

From there monasticism quickly spread out first to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the [[Judean Desert]], [[Syria]], [[North Africa]] and eventually the rest of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIn 370 Basil the Great, monastic founder in Cappadocia, became bishop of Caesarea and wrote principles of ascetic life. Eastern monastic teachings were brought to the western church by Saint John Cassian (c. 360 \u2013 c. 435).  As a young adult, he and his friend Germanus entered a monastery in Palestine but then journeyed to Egypt to visit the eremitic groups in Nitria. Many years later, Cassian founded a monastery of monks and probably also one of nuns near Marseilles. He wrote two long works, the ''Institutes'' and ''Conferences''. In these books he not only transmitted his Egyptian experience but also gave Christian monasticism a profound evangelical and theological basis.<ref name=ocso/>\n\nAt the time of his conversion in Milan in the years 386\u2013387, Augustine was aware of the life of Saint Anthony in the desert of Egypt. Upon his return to Africa as a Christian in the year 388, however, Augustine and a few Christian friends founded at Thagaste a lay community. They became cenobites in the countryside rather than in the desert.<ref name=augnet>[http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&iparentid=1112 \"Monasticism\", Augnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012002816/http://www.augnet.org/default.asp?ipageid=1113&iparentid=1112 |date=12 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSaint Benedict (c. 480 \u2013 547 AD) lived for many years as a hermit in a cave near Subiaco, Italy. He was asked to be head over several monks who wished to change to the monastic style of Pachomius by living in community. Between the years 530 and 560, he wrote the Rule of Saint Benedict as a guideline for monks living in community.<ref name=augnet/>\n\nScholars such as [[Lester K. Little]] attribute the rise of monasticism at this time to the immense changes in the church brought about by [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s legalization of Christianity. The subsequent transformation of Christianity into the main Roman religion ended the position of Christians as a minority sect. In response a new form of dedication was developed. The long-term \"martyrdom\" of the ascetic replaced the violent physical [[martyrdom]] of the [[Persecution of Christians|persecutions]].\n\n==Eastern Orthodox tradition==\n[[File:megaloschema.svg|thumb|200px|Right|''Analavos'' worn by Eastern Orthodox Schema-Monks.]]\n{{See also|Monk#Eastern Christianity}} {{Main|Eastern Christian monasticism}}\nOrthodox monasticism does not have religious orders as in the West,<ref>One may hear Orthodox monks referred to as \"Basilian Monks\", but this is really an inappropriate application of western categories to Orthodoxy.</ref> so there are no formal Monastic Rules (''Regulae''); rather, each monk and [[Nun#Eastern Orthodox Christian|nun]] is encouraged to read all of the [[Saints|Holy Fathers]] and emulate their virtues. There is also no division between the \"active\" and \"contemplative\" life. [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] monastic life embraces both active and contemplative aspects.\n\nWithin the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], there exist three types of monasticism: eremitic, cenobitic, and the [[skete]]. The skete is a very small community, often of two or three ({{bibleverse||Matthew|18:20}}), under the direction of an [[Starets|Elder]]. They pray privately for most of the week, then come together on Sundays and Feast Days for communal prayer, thus combining aspects of both eremitic and coenobitic monasticism.\n\n===Historical development===\nEven before Saint [[Anthony the Great]] (the \"father of monasticism\") went out into the desert, there were Christians who devoted their lives to ascetic discipline and striving to lead an evangelical life (i.e., in accordance with the teachings of the Gospel).\nAs monasticism spread in the East from the hermits living in the deserts of Egypt to Palestine, Syria, and on up into [[Asia Minor]] and beyond, the sayings (''apophthegmata'') and acts (''praxeis'') of the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] came to be recorded and circulated, first among their fellow monastics and then among the laity as well.\n\nAmong these earliest recorded accounts was the ''Paradise,'' by [[Palladius of Galatia]], [[Bishop of Helenopolis]] (also known as the ''[[Lausiac History]]'', after the [[prefect]] Lausus, to whom it was addressed). Saint [[Athanasius]] of Alexandria (whose ''Life of [[Saint Anthony the Great]]'' set the pattern for monastic [[hagiography]]), Saint [[Jerome]], and other anonymous compilers were also responsible for setting down very influential accounts. Also of great importance are the writings surrounding the communities founded by Saint Pachomius, the father of [[cenobite|cenobiticism]], and his disciple Saint Theodore, the founder of the skete form of monasticism.\n\nAmong the first to set forth precepts for the monastic life was Saint [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]], a man from a professional family who was educated in [[Caesarea]], [[Constantinople]], and [[Athens]]. Saint Basil visited colonies of hermits in Palestine and Egypt but was most strongly impressed by the organized communities developed under the guidance of Saint Pachomius. Saint Basil's ascetical writings set forth standards for well-disciplined community life and offered lessons in what became the ideal monastic virtue: humility.\n\nSaint Basil wrote a series of guides for monastic life (the ''Lesser Asketikon'' the ''Greater Asketikon'' the ''Morals'', etc.) which, while not \"Rules\" in the legalistic sense of later Western rules, provided firm indications of the importance of a single community of monks, living under the same roof, and under the guidance\u2014and even discipline\u2014of a strong abbot. His teachings set the model for Greek and Russian monasticism but had less influence in the Latin West.\n\nOf great importance to the development of monasticism is the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Here the [[Ladder of Divine Ascent]] was written by Saint [[John Climacus]] (c.600), a work of such importance that many Orthodox monasteries to this day read it publicly either during the [[Canonical Hours|Divine Services]] or in [[Refectory|Trapeza]] during [[Great Lent]].\n\nAt the height of the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] Empire, numerous great monasteries were established by the emperors, including the twenty \"sovereign monasteries\" on the [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]],<ref>Both Mount Sinai and Mount Athos are referred to as \"the Holy Mountain\" in Orthodox literature,</ref> an actual \"monastic republic\" wherein the entire country is devoted to bringing souls closer to God. In this milieu, the [[Philokalia]] was compiled.\n\nAs the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] between East and West grew, conflict arose over misunderstandings about [[Hesychasm]]. Saint [[Gregory Palamas]], bishop of [[Thessalonica]], an experienced Athonite monk, defended Orthodox spirituality against the attacks of [[Barlaam of Calabria]], and left numerous important works on the spiritual life.\n\n[[File:Konstantin Savitskiy Inok 1897.jpg|thumbnail|[[Konstantin Savitsky]], monk 1897]]\n\n===Present===\nChristian monasticism was and continued to be a lay condition\u2014monks depended on a local parish church for the [[sacraments]]. However, if the monastery was isolated in the desert, as were many of the Egyptian examples, that inconvenience compelled monasteries either to take in priest members, to have their abbot or other members ordained. A priest-monk is sometimes called a [[hieromonk]]. In many cases in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], when a [[Diocese|bishopric]] needed to be filled, they would look to nearby monasteries to find suitable candidates, being good sources of men who were spiritually mature and generally possessing the other qualities desired in a bishop. Eventually, among the Orthodox Churches it became established by [[canon law]] that all bishops must be monks.\n\nMonastic centers thrive to this day in [[Bulgaria]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Greece]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], the [[Holy Land]], and elsewhere in the Orthodox world, the [[Mount Athos|Autonomous Monastic State of Mount Athos]] remaining the spiritual center of monasticism for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], a great renaissance of monasticism has occurred, and many previously empty or destroyed monastic communities have been reopened.\n\nMonasticism continues to be very influential in the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to the [[Canon Law#Orthodox Churches|Sacred Canons]], all Bishops must be monks (not merely celibate), and feast days to [[Canonization|Glorified]] monastic saints are an important part of the liturgical tradition of the church. [[Fasting]], Hesychasm, and the pursuit of the spiritual life are strongly encouraged not only among monastics but also among the laity.\n\n===Types of monks===\n{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}\n[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-39.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orthodox monks farming potatoes in [[Russia]], c. 1910]]\n\nThere are also three levels of monks: The Rassophore, the Stavrophore, and the Schema-Monk (or Schema-Nun). Each of the three degrees represents an increased level of asceticism. In the early days of monasticism, there was only one level\u2014the Great Schema\u2014and even Saint [[Theodore the Studite]] argued against the establishment of intermediate grades, but nonetheless the consensus of the church has favored the development of three distinct levels.\n\nWhen a candidate wishes to embrace the monastic life, he will enter the monastery of his choice as a guest and ask to be received by the [[Hegumen]] (Abbot). After a period of at least three days the Hegumen may at his discretion clothe the candidate as a [[novice]]. There is no formal ceremony for the clothing of a novice; he (or she) would simply be given the [[cassock#Eastern practice .28Orthodox and Eastern Catholic.29|''Podraznik'']], belt and ''[[skoufos]]''.\n\nAfter a period of about three years, the Hegumen may at his discretion [[tonsure]] the novice as a ''Rassophore'' monk, giving him the outer garment called the Rassa (Greek: ''Rason''). A monk (or nun) may remain in this grade all the rest of his life, if he so chooses. But the Rite of Tonsure for the Rassophore refers to the grade as that of the \"Beginner\", so it is intended that the monk will advance on to the next level. The Rassophore is also given a [[klobuk]] which he wears in church and on formal occasions. In addition, Rassophores will be given a [[prayer rope]] at their tonsure.\n\nThe next rank, ''Stavrophore'', is the grade that most Russian monks remain all their lives. The title Stavrophore means \"cross-bearer\", because when Tonsured into this grade the monastic is given a cross to wear at all times. This cross is called a Paramand\u2014a wooden cross attached by ribbons to a square cloth embroidered with the [[Passion (Christianity)#Instruments of the Passion|Instruments of the Passion]] and the words, \"I bear upon my body the marks of the Lord Jesus\" ({{bibleverse||Galatians|6:17}}). The Paramand is so called because it is worn under the [[Mantle (vesture)|Mantle]] (Greek: ''Mandyas''; [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]]: ''Mantya''), which is a long cape which completely covers the monk from neck to foot. Among the Russians, Stavrophores are also informally referred to as \"mantle monks\". At his Tonsure, a Stavrophore is given a wooden hand cross and a lit candle, as well as a prayer rope.\n\n[[File:St Anthony of Kiev.jpg|thumb|300px|left|St. [[Anthony of Kiev]] wearing the Great Schema.]]\nThe highest rank of monasticism is the ''Great Schema'' (Greek: ''Megaloschemos''; Church Slavonic: ''Schimnik''). Attaining the level of ''Schema monk'' is much more common among the Greeks than it is among the Russians, for whom it is normally reserved to hermits, or to very advanced monastics. The ''Schema monk'' or ''Schema nun'' wears the same habit as the Rassophore, but to it is added the ''Analavos'' (Church Slavonic: ''Analav''), a garment shaped like a cross, covering the shoulders and coming down to the knees (or lower) in front and in back. This garment is roughly reminiscent of the [[scapular]] worn by some Roman Catholic orders, but it is finely embroidered with the Cross and instruments of the Passion (see illustration, above). The Klobuk worn by a Schema monk is also embroidered with a red cross and other symbols. the Klobuk may be shaped differently, more rounded at the top, in which case it is referred to as a ''koukoulion''. The skufia worn by a Schema monk is also more intricately embroidered.\n\nThe [[religious habit]] worn by Orthodox monastics is the same for both monks and nuns, except that the nuns wear an additional veil, called an ''[[apostolnik]]''.\n\nThe central and unifying feature of Orthodox monasticism is [[Hesychasm]], the practice of silence, and the concentrated saying of the [[Jesus Prayer]]. All ascetic practices and monastic humility is guided towards preparing the heart for [[Theoria#Eastern Orthodox Church|''theoria'']] or the \"divine vision\" that comes from the union of the soul with God. Such union is not accomplished by any human activity. All an ascetic can do is prepare the ground; it is for God to cause the seed to grow and bear fruit.\n\n==Western Christian monasticism==\n===History===\nThe introduction of monasticism into the West may be dated from about A.D. 340 when St. Athanasius visited Rome accompanied by the two Egyptian monks Ammon and Isidore, disciples of St. Anthony. The publication of the \"Vita Antonii\" some years later and its translation into Latin spread the knowledge of Egyptian monachism widely and many were found in Italy to imitate the example thus set forth. The first Italian monks aimed at reproducing exactly what was done in Egypt and not a few\u2014such as St. Jerome, Rufinus, Paula, Eustochium and the two Melanias\u2014actually went to live in Egypt or Palestine as being better suited to monastic life than Italy.<ref name=huddleston/>\n\nThe earliest phases of monasticism in Western Europe involved figures like [[Martin of Tours]], who after serving in the Roman legions converted to Christianity and established a hermitage near [[Milan]], then moved on to [[Poitiers]] where a community gathered around his hermitage. He was called to become [[Bishop of Tours]] in 372, where he established a monastery at [[Marmoutiers]] on the opposite bank of the [[Loire River]], a few miles upstream from the city. His cell was a hut of wood, and round it his disciples, who soon numbered eighty, dwelt in caves and huts. His monastery was laid out as a colony of hermits rather than as a single integrated community. The type of life was simply the Antonian monachism of Egypt.<ref name=huddleston/>\n\n[[Honoratus of Marseilles]] was a wealthy [[Gallo-Roman]] aristocrat, who after a pilgrimage to Egypt, founded the [[L\u00e9rins Abbey|Monastery of L\u00e9rins]] in 410, on an island lying off the modern city of [[Cannes]]. The monastery combined a community with isolated hermitages where older, spiritually-proven monks could live in isolation. L\u00e9rins became, in time, a center of monastic culture and learning, and many later monks and bishops would pass through L\u00e9rins in the early stages of their career.<ref name=Gilbert>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10472a.htm Huddleston, Gilbert. \"Western Monasticism.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 18 December 2015</ref> Honoratus was called to be [[Bishop of Arles]].\n\n[[John Cassian]] began his monastic career at a monastery in Palestine and Egypt around 385 to study monastic practice there. In Egypt he had been attracted to the isolated life of hermits, which he considered the highest form of monasticism, yet the monasteries he founded were all organized monastic communities. About 415 he established two monasteries near [[Marseilles]],<ref name=Gilbert/> one for men, one for women. In time these attracted a total of 5,000 monks and nuns. Most significant for the future development of monasticism were Cassian's ''Institutes'', which provided a guide for monastic life and his ''Conferences'', a collection of spiritual reflections.\n\n====Celtic monasticism====\nIt seems that the first Celtic monasteries were merely settlements where the Christians lived together\u2014priests and laity, men, women, and children alike\u2014as a kind of religious clan.<ref name=Gilbert/> According to James F.

The monastery became the spiritual focus of the tribe or kin group. Successive abbots and abbesses were members of the founder's family, a policy which kept the monastic lands under the jurisdiction of the family (and corresponded to Irish legal tradition, which only allowed the transfer of land within a family).\nIn Ireland, the abbot was often called \"coarb\", a term designating the heir of successor of the founder.<ref name=Addleshaw/>\n\nThe abbots of the principal monasteries\u2014 such as Clonard, Armagh, Clonmacnoise, Swords, etc.\u2014were of the highest rank and held in the greatest esteem. They wielded great power and had vast influence. The abbot usually was only a presbyter, but in the large monasteries there were one or more resident bishops who conferred orders and discharged the other functions of a bishop. The abbot was superior of the house, and all were subject to him.<ref name=ohalloran/>\n\nThe Irish rule was rigorous. It was more or less a copy of the French rule, as the French was a copy of the Thebaid. The daily routine of monastic life was prayer, study, and manual labor. With regard to food the rule was very strict. Only one meal a day, at 3 o'clock p.m., was allowed, except on Sundays and Feast days. Wednesdays and Fridays were fast days, except the interval between Easter and Whit Sunday. The food allowed was barley bread, milk, fish, and eggs. Flesh meat was not allowed except on great feasts.<ref name=ohalloran>[http://www.libraryireland.com/WestCorkHistory/Monasteries.php O'Halloran, W., ''Early Irish History and Antiquities and the History of West Cork'', Chapter XI, 1916]</ref>\n\nIn Ireland a distinctive form of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|penance]] developed, where confession was made privately to a priest, under the seal of secrecy, and where penance was given privately and ordinarily performed privately as well.<ref>''Medieval Handbooks of Penance'', eds.

Saints' lives frequently tell of monks (and abbots) departing some distance from the monastery to live in isolation from the community. Irish monastic rules specify a stern life of prayer and discipline in which prayer, poverty, and obedience are the central themes.\n\nIrish monks needed to learn Latin, the language of the Church. Thus they read Latin texts, both spiritual and secular, with an enthusiasm that their contemporaries on the continent lacked. Subjects taught included Latin, Greek, Hebrew, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, arithmetic, chronology, the Holy Places, hymns, sermons, natural science, history and especially the interpretation of Sacred Scripture.<ref name=ohalloran/> In 544 [[Ciar\u00e1n of Clonmacnoise|St Ciar\u00e1n]] founded a monastery at [[Clonmacnoise]], which became one of the most important centres of learning and religious life in Ireland.  Contrary to common practice, the title of abbot {{ndash}} which included the title \"[[Comarba]] of Saint Ciar\u00e1n\" {{ndash}} at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. In 557 [[Brendan|St Brendan]] founded a monastery at Clonfert.\n\nBy the end of the seventh century, Irish [[monastic school]]s were attracting students from England and from Europe.\n\nThe achievements of [[insular art]], in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], [[high cross]]es, and metalwork like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], and in the case of manuscript decoration had a profound influence on Western medieval art. The manuscripts were produced by and for monasteries, and evidence suggests that metalwork was produced in both monastic and royal workshops.<ref>\"'The Work of Angels', Masterpieces of Celtic Metalwork\", (Susan Youngs, ed.) London: British Museum Press. 1989, {{ISBN|0-7141-0554-6}}</ref>\n\n==== Culdees ====\n{{Main|Culdees}}\n\n==== Hiberno-Scottish mission ====\nIrish monasticism spread widely, first to [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]], then to Gaul and Italy. [[Columba]] and his followers established monasteries at [[Bangor Abbey|Bangor]], on the northeastern coast of Ireland, at [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], an island north-west of Scotland, and at [[Lindisfarne]], which was founded by Aidan, an Irish monk from Iona, at the request of King [[Oswald of Northumbria]]. Abbots of Iona were normally appointed from the founders kin, with an abbot often naming hhis successor.<ref name=Addleshaw/>\n\n[[Columbanus]], an abbot from a Leinster noble family, traveled to Gaul in the late 6th century with twelve companions. Columbanus and his followers spread the Irish model of monastic institutions to the continent. A whole series of new monastic foundations under Irish influence sprang up, starting with Columbanus's foundations of [[Luxeuil]] and [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Luxeuil]] and, sponsored by the Frankish King [[Childebert II]]. After Childebert's death Columbanus traveled east to Metz, where Theudebert II allowed him to establish a new monastery among the semi-pagan [[Alemanni]] in what is now [[Switzerland]]. One of Columbanus's followers founded the monastery of St. Gall on the shores of Lake Constance, while Columbanus continued onward across the [[Alps]] to the kingdom of the [[Lombards]] in Italy. There King [[Agilulf]] and his wife [[Theodolinda]] granted Columbanus land in the mountains between [[Genoa]] and Milan, where he established the monastery of [[Bobbio]]. From about 698 until the reign of Charlemagne in the 770s, the Hiberno-Scottish efforts in the Frankish Empire were continued by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]. The rule of St. Columbanus, which was originally followed in most of these monasteries, was eventually superseded by that of St. Benedict.\n\n====Benedictine monasticism====\n[[File:Heiligenkreuz.St. Benedict.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Saint Benedict]] by Herman Nieg, Heiligenkreuz Abbey, Austria]]\n\n[[Benedict of Nursia]] is the most influential of Western monks and is called \"the Father of Western Monasticism\". He was educated in Rome but soon sought the life of a hermit in a cave at [[Subiaco, Italy|Subiaco]], outside the city.  He then attracted followers with whom he founded the monastery of [[Monte Cassino]] around 520, between Rome and [[Naples]]. He established the [[Rule of St Benedict]], adapting in part the earlier anonymous [[Rule of the Master]] (''Regula magistri''), which was written somewhere south of Rome around 500, and defined the activities of the monastery, its officers, and their responsibilities. By the ninth century, largely under the inspiration of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]], Benedict's Rule became the basic guide for Western monasticism.\n\nWhile the Celtic monasteries had a stronger connection to the semi-eremitical tradition of Egypt via L\u00e9rins and Tours, Benedict and his followers were more influenced by the cenobitism of St [[Pachomius]] and [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil the Great]]. Early Benedictine monasteries were relatively small and consisted of an oratory, refectory, dormitory, scriptorium, guest accommodation and out-buildings, a group of often quite separate rooms more reminiscent of a decent sized Roman villa than a large medieval abbey. A monastery of about a dozen monks would have been normal during this period.\n\nMedieval monastic life consisted of prayer, reading, and manual labor.<ref>[http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/medieval-monastery.htm Middle-ages.org.uk]</ref> Prayer was a monk's first priority. Apart from prayer, monks performed a variety of tasks, such as preparing medicine, lettering, reading, and others. Also, these monks would work in the gardens and on the land. They might also spend time in the cloister, a covered colonnade around a courtyard, where they would pray or read.  Some monasteries held a scriptorium where monks would write or copy books. When the monks wrote, they used very neat handwriting and would [[Illuminated manuscript|draw illustrations in the books]] and decorate the first letter of each paragraph.\n\nThe efficiency of Benedict's cenobitic Rule in addition to the stability of the monasteries made them very productive. The monasteries were the central storehouses and producers of knowledge.  Vikings started attacking Irish monasteries famous for learning in 793. One monk wrote about how he did not mind the bad weather one evening because it kept the Vikings from coming: \"Bitter is the wind tonight, it tosses the ocean\u2019s white hair, I need not fear\u2014as on a night of calm sea\u2014the fierce raiders from Lochlann.\"<ref>Rowling, Marjorie. Everyday Life in Medieval Times. London: Jarrold and Sons Ltd., 1968, page 114</ref>\n\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries the growing pressure of monarchies and the nation states undermined the wealth and power of the orders. Monasticism continued to play a role in Catholicism, but after the [[Protestant reformation]] many monasteries in Northern Europe [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|were shut down]] and their assets seized.\n\n===Military orders===\nIn the twelfth century, traditional monastic orders in [[Outremer]] evolved into military orders, initially for the purpose of defending pilgrims, although they later became larger military forced that played a key role in combating Muslim efforts at reconquest and propping up continued Christian rule in the region. These orders included the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Hospitallers]]. In large part, the notion of military monasticism became so popular because of the advocacy of [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]], who believed that existing Christian methods of serving the Church's ends in war were inadequate, and that a group of dedicated warrior monks, who achieved spiritual merit and served God through waging war, was necessary. In his view, advancing the cause of Christendom was an end that justified means that might fall outside the bounds of [[just war]]. <ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 75.</ref> \n\nThese orders largely declined with the loss of Outremer in the 1200s - except for the [[Teutonic Order]], which transferred itself to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] where it took up a major role in the [[Baltic Crusades]]. In the Baltic, warrior monks used massacre and forced conversion to compel the submission of local pagan tribes, which disliked the Order's rule and rebelled repeatedly. They also enslaved members of defeated tribes, sometimes refusing to permit them to be baptized in order to keep them in a state of enslavement (which was theologically justifiable only against non-Christians). <ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 88</ref>\n\n===Western Christian orders in the modern era===\nMany distinct monastic orders developed within [[Roman Catholic religious order|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]]. Monastic communities in the West, broadly speaking, are organized into orders and congregations guided by a particular religious rule, such as the [[Rule of St Augustine]] or especially [[Rule of St Benedict]]. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have a system of orders per se, though some of the Eastern Catholic Churches do.\n\n====Roman Catholicism====\n{{canon law}}\n{{Main|Roman Catholic religious order}}\n\n* [[Benedictine]]s, founded in 529 by Benedict at [[Monte Cassino]], stresses manual labor in a self-subsistent monastery.

These men and others came and went over the years. The community has always remained small; at times the only member was Father Arthur. During the 35 years of its existence over 25 men tested their vocations to monastic life by living at the house for some time, from a few months to many years, but at Father Arthur's death in 1989 only one permanent resident remained. At the beginning of 2006, there are two permanent professed members and two long-term guests. Strong ties remain with this community and their brothers in Sweden ([[\u00d6stanb\u00e4ck Monastery]])<ref>[http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm \u00d6stanb\u00e4ck monastery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813114047/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/klostren/OSTANENG.htm |date=13 August 2011 }}</ref> and in Germany the ([[Priory of St. Wigbert]]).<ref>[http://www.wigberti.de Priorat St. Wigberti: Unser Kloster]</ref> In Germany, [[Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring]]<ref>[http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html Communit\u00e4t Casteller Ring] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911174924/http://www.schwanberg.de/index.php/communitaet-casteller-ring-ev.html |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref> is a Lutheran Benedictine community for women.

The property and lands of the [[monastery|monasteries]] were confiscated and either retained by the King, sold to landowners, or given to loyal [[nobility]]. [[Monk]]s and [[nun]]s were pensioned off and retired or some were forced to either flee for the continent or to abandon their vocations. For around 300 years, there were no monastic communities within any of the [[Anglican]] churches.\n\nShortly after the [[Oxford Movement]] began to advocate restoring [[catholic]] faith and practice to the [[Church of England]] (see [[Anglo-Catholicism]]), there was felt to be a need for a restoration of the monastic life. Anglican [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] [[John Henry Newman]] established a community of men at [[Littlemore]] near [[Oxford]] in the 1840s while he was vicar of [[Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore]]. From then forward, there have been many communities of [[monk]]s, [[friar]]s, sisters, and [[nun]]s established within the [[Anglican Communion]]. In 1848, Mother [[Priscilla Lydia Sellon]] founded the Anglican Sisters of Charity and became the first woman to take religious vows within the [[Anglican Communion]] since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]]. In October 1850 the first building specifically built for the purpose of housing an [[Sisterhoods (Modern Anglican)|Anglican Sisterhood]] was consecrated at Abbeymere in [[Plymouth]]. It housed several schools for the destitute, a laundry, printing press and soup kitchen. From the 1840s and throughout the following one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated in the UK and the United States, as well as in various countries of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Canada]], India and the [[Pacific]].\n\nSome Anglican religious communities are contemplative, some active, but a distinguishing feature of the monastic life among Anglicans is that most practice the so-called \"mixed life\", a combination of a life of contemplative prayer with active service. Anglican religious life closely mirrors that of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Like Roman Catholic religious, Anglican religious also take the three vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Religious communities live together under a common rule, reciting the [[Canonical hours|Divine Office]] and celebrating the [[Eucharist]] daily.\n\nIn the early 20th century when the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic movement]] was at its height, the [[Anglican Communion]] had hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of religious. However, since the 1960s there has been a sharp falling off in the numbers of religious in many parts of the Anglican Communion, most notably in the United Kingdom and the United States. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single convent or monastery composed of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in religious communities around the world. While vocations remain few in some areas, Anglican religious communities are experiencing exponential growth in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Oceania]].\n\nAround 1964, Reuben Archer Torrey III, an Episcopal missionary, grandson of [[Reuben Archer Torrey|R. A. Torrey]], founded Jesus Abbey as a missionary community in [[Korea]]. It has some links with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and holds an [[Evangelical Anglicanism|Evangelical doctrine]].\n\n====Methodist Churches====\nIn February 2001, the [[United Methodist Church]] organized the [[Saint Brigid of Kildare Monastery]]. It is a Methodist-Benedictine residential [[double monastery]] in [[Collegeville, Minnesota]]. Besides monastic orders, the [[Order of Saint Luke]] is a dispersed religious order within Methodism.\n\n====Presbyterian Churches====\nThe Community of the Sisterhood Emmanuel was founded in 1973 in Makak - in the Centre Province by Mother Marie, one of the first female Pastors of the Presbyterian Church in Cameroon. In 1975 she moved the community to the present site- at Agyati in Bafut.  It has 10 finally consecrated Sisters, four in simple vows and a handful of others in formation.  The Sisters are trained in strong collaboration with the sister Institutes of the Catholic Church. They say that one of their charisms is ecumenism. The Sisterhood Emmanuel is the only Presbyterian Monastery in Cameroon.\n\n====Anabaptism====\n[[Anabaptist]] Christians \"retained many elements of the monastic understanding of a 'holy life' that followed true faith\".<ref name=\"RedekopKrahn1994\">{{cite book|last1=Redekop|first1=Calvin Wall|last2=Krahn|first2=Victor A.|last3=Steiner|first3=Samuel J.|title=Anabaptist/Mennonite Faith and Economics|year=1994|publisher=University Press of America|language=English|isbn=9780819193506|page=15}}</ref> The [[Hutterites]] and [[Bruderhof]], for example, live in intentional communities with their big houses having \"ground floors for common work, meals and worship, the two-storey attics with small rooms, like monastic cells, for married couples\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Quakerism and Shakerism====\nThe [[Shakers]], who are also known as the \"Shaking Quakers\", have been characterized as a \"Protestant monastic order providing refuge and otherworldly compensation\".<ref name=\"Hammond1985\">{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Phillip E.|title=The Sacred in a Secular Age: Toward Revision in the Scientific Study of Religion|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredinseculara00hamm|url-access=registration|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|language=English |isbn=9780520053434|page=[https://archive.org/details/sacredinseculara00hamm/page/28 28]}}</ref> They practice a celibate and communal lifestyle, [[pacifism]], and their model of [[equality of the sexes]], which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s.

The Order understands its charism to include not only ecumenical efforts and the traditional emphases of the Franciscans in general, but also to help to develop relationships between the various Franciscan orders.\n\nAdditional expressions of ecumenical monasticism can be seen in the [[Bose Monastic Community]] and communities of the [[New Monasticism]] movement arising from Protestant Evangelicalism.\n\nIn 1999 an independent Protestant order was founded named [[The Knights of Prayer Monastic Order]]. The community maintains several monks in its [[Portland, Oregon]], cloister and has an international network of associated lay people. It is not affiliated with any particular congregation.\n\n==Contributions==\n[[File:ZCHronsk\u00fdSv\u00e4t\u00fdBe\u0148adikKostol.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A monastery in [[Hronsk\u00fd Be\u0148adik]] ([[Slovakia]]).]]\nIn traditional Catholic societies, monastic communities often took charge of social services such as [[education]] and [[healthcare]]. The legacy of monasteries outside remains an important current in modern society. [[Max Weber]] compared the closeted and [[Puritan]] societies of the [[English Dissenters]], who sparked much of the [[industrial revolution]], to monastic orders. Many [[Utopianism|Utopian]] thinkers (starting with [[Thomas More]]) felt inspired by the common life of monks to apply it to the whole society (an example is the [[phalanst\u00e8re]]). Modern [[universities]] have also attempted to emulate Christian monasticism. Even in the [[Americas]], universities are built in the [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] style of twelfth century monasteries. Communal meals, dormitory residences, elaborate rituals and dress all borrow heavily from the monastic tradition. Today monasticism remains an important part of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Anglican faiths.\n\n===Education===\nThe capitulary of 789 reads: \"Let every monastery and every abbey have its school, in which boys may be taught the Psalms, the system of musical notation, singing, arithmetic and grammar\". There can be no doubt that by boys are meant not only the candidates for the monastery and the wards (generally the children of nobles) committed to the care of the monks, but also the children of the village or country district around the monastery, for whom there was usually an external school attached to groups of monastic buildings.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03349c.htm Turner, William. \"Carolingian Schools.\"] The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 11 February 2015</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, monasteries conserved and copied ancient manuscripts in their [[scriptorium|scriptoria]]. A prospective monk first learned grammar, logic, and oratory. Later, he would take up mathematics, astronomy, and music. The students would use a stylus on wax. Later, when their handwriting improved, they would be given ink and parchment. Eventually, many of those schools became universities.<ref>[http://historymedren.about.com/cs/monasticism/a/keepers_2.htm Historymedrend.about.com]</ref> Monks in scriptoria copied texts of Greece and Rome, as well as religious texts, and kept these manuscripts from being lost during the Middle Ages.\n\n===Medicine===\n[[File:Soutra Aisle.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=A Picture of the Hospital of [[Soutra Aisle]].|The Hospital at [[Soutra Aisle]].]] Monastic [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] stored and studied [[medicament]]s. Some of the works that the monks copied were by medical writers, and reading and copying these works helped create a store of medical knowledge. Monasteries had infirmaries to treat the monks, travelers, the poor, old, weak and sick. In 2005, archeologists uncovered waste at [[Soutra Aisle]] which helped scientists figure out how people in the Middle Ages treated certain diseases, such as scurvy; because of the vitamin C in watercress, patients would eat it to stop their teeth from falling out. The same archeological group discovered hemlock, a known pain killer, in the drains of the hospital.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3745498.stm | work=BBC News | title=The medical world of medieval monks | date=6 August 2005 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nMonasteries also aided in the development of agricultural techniques. The requirement of [[wine]] for the Mass led to the development of [[enology|wine culture]], as shown in the discovery of the ''[[m\u00e9thode champenoise]]'' by [[Dom P\u00e9rignon (person)|Dom Perignon]]. Several liquors like ''[[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]]'' and the [[Trappist beer]]s were also developed in monasteries. Even today many monasteries and convents are locally renowned for their cooking specialties.\n\nThe consequence of this centralisation of knowledge was that they initially controlled both public administration and education, where the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] led through the [[quadrivium]] to [[theology]]. Christian monks cultivated the arts as a way of praising God. [[Gregorian chant]] and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] are examples of the practical application of quadrivium subjects.\n\nThe status of monks as apart from secular life (at least theoretically) also served a social function. Dethroned [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic kings]] were [[tonsure]]d and sent to a monastery so that they could not claim the crown back. Monasteries became a place for [[second son]]s to live in celibacy so that the family inheritance went to [[primogeniture|the first son]]; in exchange the families donated to the monasteries. Few cities lacked both a St Giles house for lepers outside the walls and a Magdalene house for prostitutes and other women of notoriety within the walls, and some orders were favored by monarchs and rich families to keep and educate their [[maiden]] daughters before [[arranged marriage]].\n\nThe monasteries also provided refuge to those like [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] who retired to [[Yuste]] in his late years, and his son [[Philip II of Spain]], who was functionally as close to a monastic as his regal responsibilities permitted.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asceticism]]\n* ''[[Clasau]]''\u2014the early Welsh monasteries\n* [[Consensoria Monachorum]]\n* [[Coptic monasticism]]\n* [[Hermit]]\n* [[Intentional community]]\n* ''[[Into Great Silence]]''\u2014the award-winning documentary of life within the Carthusian monsastery of La Grande Chartreuse by Philip Groning\n* [[List of monastic houses in England]]\n* [[Mount Athos]]\n* [[New Monasticism]]\n* [[Order of Watchers]]\u2014a French Protestant fraternity of Hermits\n* [[Pachomius]]\u2014an early example of a monastic organizer\n* [[Poustinia]]\n* [[Rule of St Benedict]]\n\n==Notes, references, and sources==\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{Cite book |title=Saints and Sinners in Early Christian Ireland: Moral Theology in the Lives of Saints Brigit and Columba |last=Ritari |first=K. |year= 2009 |publisher= Brepols Publishers |location=Turnhout |isbn=978-2-503-53315-5}}\n* {{Cite book |title= Medieval Monasticism |last= Lawrence |first=C.
