First he allowed the defense to argue that some of the evidence was planted despite producing no evidence that it was. Next he ruled the prosecution must reserve at least 10% of the DNA samples for the defense to test themselves. The prosecution actually preserved nearly all the samples for the defense but they ultimately declined to test the samples themselves. Next Ito allowed John Gerdes to testify about contamination in prior LAPD cases. His testifying about prior mistakes is prejudicial to the prosecution and misleading to the jury because it allowed Gerdes to conflate evidence of contamination in previous cases with the Simpson case. In the subsequent civil trial, all of decisions were reversed by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, who banned all allegations of police conspiracy and only allowed Dr. Gerdes to testify to confirmed cases of contamination, in this case only.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpson.walraven.org|title=Suits, Motions and Court Orders for Civil Trial|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Thano Peratis ===\nPrison nurse Thano Peratis testified he drew an undocumented amount of blood from Simpson.

The volume of DNA evidence was unique and criminalists felt they could reconstruct the crime with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account. With over one hundred exhibits, the defense would have to discredit all of them to establish reasonable doubt. The prosecution also produced corroborating evidence - hair follicles, clothing fibers from the victims and fibers from the Bronco - found with the exhibits to corroborate their theory of how the crime was committed. Mistakes made during the evidence collection were highlighted and repeated during DNA expert cross-examination but the prosecution began offering evidence refuting the claim that the mistakes rendered the results unreliable. With three different labs cross-checking the evidence and no discrepancies found during testing plus the defense declining to challenge the results by testing the evidence themselves, the prosecution expected a conviction. However, three assumptions about the jury turned out to be inaccurate: they would listen during the testimony, they would understand the testimony and they would consider the testimony in rendering their verdict. Ultimately, none of these would be true.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/what-was-the-evidence-against-oj-simpson-in-the-nicole-brown-simpson-murder-4794|title=What Was The Evidence Against O.J.

They said the police compromised the evidence by committing several mistakes when collecting it including occasionally not changing gloves between evidence items, using one swatch to collect blood from three drops of blood on the bronco dashboard, packaging the swatches of blood evidence using plastic bags, not paper bags as recommended, and storing them in a police van for up to seven hours unrefrigerated. This resulted in 100% of the \"real killers\" DNA being lost. They argued that Simpson's blood found on the evidence samples resulted from contamination in the LAPD crime lab with the reference blood in all but three exhibits. The remaining three exhibits that could not be explained by contamination were planted by the police. Although evidence of mistakes made during collection were shown at trial, no evidence of their contamination or corruption claim was presented. \n\nThe contamination claim was dependent on all the blood in the case being 100% degraded and the real killer's DNA lost. If that did not happen, contamination would only produce a mixture of Simpsons  DNA and the killers. The contamination claim likewise would spread EDTA to the evidence samples which could be tested for as it was a preservative found in the reference vials of Simpson and the two victims. The contamination claim was also limited to just the LAPD crime lab as it was not alleged at the two consulting labs, the state department and Cellmarks diagnostics, were most of the DNA testing was done. The defense also declined to test the samples themselves for the \u201creal killers\u201d DNA or for EDTA.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=DNA%20evidence&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

Using a reference article from the EPA, he testified that because the amount of EDTA in that blood is measured in \"parts-per-million\" (PPM) and the reference article states normally EDTA in the blood should only be detectable in \"parts-per-billion\" (PPB), the evidence blood contains a thousand times more EDTA than it should. Because EDTA is used as a preservative in purple top tubes for lab draws, he stated the blood could have come from their reference vials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211050844/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/27.html|title=COURTTV.COM - TRIALS - O.J.

However, by the end of the trial the defense would eventually claim that virtually all of the blood evidence was planted by the police including the blood drops found next to the bloody foot prints (match Simpson), the trail leading away from the victims (match Simpson), the blood on the back gate at Nicole Browns home (match Simpson), the blood inside and outside Simpson's Bronco (matched Simpson and both victims); the glove found at Simpson's residence at Rockingham (match Simpson and both victims), the blood inside and outside of his home on Rockingham (match Simpson); and the blood on the socks in his bedroom (match Simpson and Nicole Brown).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpson.walraven.org/pm_07.html|title=Plaintiff Motion (Goldman) to Bar Claims of Planted Evidence|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==== Bundy Back Gate ====\nThe defense claimed that one drop of blood on the back gate at Nicole Brown's home was planted by the police. As evidence they offered the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in purple top tubes used for blood draws, it was collected several weeks later on July 3, rather than on June 13, and 1.5 mL of Simpsons donated reference blood was unaccounted for. The officer who planted it was not named by the defense. The prosecution countered that the EDTA levels found in the blood was consistent with that found normally in unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels found in blood preserved in a purple top tube. A different photograph of the gate on June 13 shows the blood was already there and the claim of some of Simpson's reference blood missing from the vial was refuted during rebuttal by the nurse who drew it who clarified he believes he only drew the amount the records show was used for testing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=Now%20the%20prosecution%20had%20a%20response&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

As evidence, they offered that Vannatter did have possession of Nicole Brown's autopsy blood briefly prior to booking it into evidence and the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in the reference vial of Nicole Brown autopsy blood. The claim was refuted by the defenses own witness, FBI special agent Roger Martz who showed the level of EDTA in that blood drop is consistent with unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels that would be seen in blood from a purple top tube. The prosecution also countered that no blood was ever claimed to be missing from Nicole Brown's reference vial and that the records show Detective Vannatter booked the reference vials from the victims immediately into evidence right after receiving it from Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Irwin Golden. Dr. Cotton conclusively refuted that claim by showing the blood in the reference vial is substantially more degraded than the blood on the sock, proving it did not come from that vial.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bewick, Dr Michael, (born 11 Sept. 1956), Deputy Medical Director, NHS England, since 2013|date=2014-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u279641|work=Who's Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>\n==== Rockingham Glove ====\nThe defense claimed the bloody glove found at Simpsons Rockingham estate was planted by Detective Mark Fuhrman who said he found it there.

Thus, if Fuhrman planted the glove at Rockingham from the crime scene, that means Simpson's blood was at the crime scene which contradicts his claim he was home that night. Fuhrman's DNA was also not found on the glove which supports his claim he did not plant it. The prosecution argued that Fuhrman didn't plant the glove because he didn't know if Simpson had an air-tight alibi that night. Vincent Bugliosi concurs with the prosecutor's argument noting as well that Fuhrman did not know whose blood was on it at the time either.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=fuhrman&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

The blood was collected and shipped directly to the state department lab, not the LAPD lab, so contamination couldn't explain it and the blood was testable so it wasn't compromised and Dr. Cotton said the chances it wasn't Simpsons was 1-in-9.7 billion.\n\nForeman Amanda Cooley responded she had no explanation for that incriminating evidence and it didn't factor into their reasonable doubt decision, implying she ignored it. \n\nJuror Marsha Rubin-Jackson responded she thinks Simpson's blood was left there next to the bloody footprints prior to the murders happening. The defense never suggested this and Simpson said he was never there that day.\n\nJuror Carrie Bess responded that she thinks the blood belonged to Simpson's children. Dr Cotton said the chances of it being anyone else other than O.J. Simpson was 1-in-9.7 billion.    \n\n====Lionel \"Lion\" Cryer ====\nLionel \"Lion\" Cryer was one of the jurors who came out strong for Simpson's innocence during deliberations and afterwards. Since then, he stated he does now believe that Simpsons is guilty of the murders. He admitted that what he thought at the time was a reasonable doubt of the DNA evidence really wasn't and that is the hardest thing to admit to now because the media has portrayed the jurors as incompetent since the trial and no answer he gives for why he doubted the blood evidence will make that impression any better.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/news/221848_oj_simpson_juror_says_he_endured_intense_therapy_after_murder_trial_talks_not_guilty_verdict|title=EXCLUSIVE: OJ Simpson Juror Says He Underwent Intense Therapy After Murder Trial, Talks Not-Guilty Verdict|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oj-juror-who-raised-black-power-fist-salute-black-panther/|title=OJ Juror Who Raised Black Power Fist Was a Black Panther|date=2016-04-06|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\nHe stated that portion of the trial dragged on longer than most people realize.

First he allowed the defense to argue that some of the evidence was planted despite producing no evidence that it was. Next he ruled the prosecution must reserve at least 10% of the DNA samples for the defense to test themselves. The prosecution actually preserved nearly all the samples for the defense but they ultimately declined to test the samples themselves. Next Ito allowed John Gerdes to testify about contamination in prior LAPD cases. His testifying about prior mistakes is prejudicial to the prosecution and misleading to the jury because it allowed Gerdes to conflate evidence of contamination in previous cases with the Simpson case. In the subsequent civil trial, all of decisions were reversed by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, who banned all allegations of police conspiracy and only allowed Dr. Gerdes to testify to confirmed cases of contamination, in this case only.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpson.walraven.org|title=Suits, Motions and Court Orders for Civil Trial|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Thano Peratis ===\nPrison nurse Thano Peratis testified he drew an undocumented amount of blood from Simpson.

The volume of DNA evidence was unique and criminalist felt they could reconstruct the crime with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account. With over one hundred exhibits, the defense would have to discredit all of them to establish reasonable doubt. The prosecution also produced corroborating evidence - hair follicles, clothing fibers from the victims and fibers from the Bronco - found with the exhibits to corroborate their theory of how the crime was committed. Mistakes made during the evidence collection were highlighted and repeated during DNA expert cross-examination but the prosecution began offering evidence refuting the claim that the mistakes rendered the results unreliable. With three different labs cross-checking the evidence and no discrepancies found during testing plus the defense declining to challenge the results by testing the evidence themselves, the prosecution expected a conviction. However, three assumptions about the jury turned out to be inaccurate: they would listen during the testimony, they would understand the testimony and they would consider the testimony in rendering their verdict. Ultimately, none of these would be true.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.romper.com/p/what-was-the-evidence-against-oj-simpson-in-the-nicole-brown-simpson-murder-4794|title=What Was The Evidence Against O.J.

Scheck aggressively tried to shake Fung's time line about when he received Simpsons donated blood, hoping to show that police actually delivered it the following day, June 14, instead of June 13, giving them a whole day with Simpsons blood they could allegedly use to frame him.

They said the police compromised the evidence by committing several mistakes when collecting it including occasionally not changing gloves between evidence items, using one swatch to collect blood from three drops of blood on the bronco dashboard, packaging the swatches of blood evidence using plastic bags not paper bags as recommended, and storing them in a police van for up to seven hours unrefrigerated. This resulted in 100% of the \"real killers\" DNA being lost. They argued that Simpsons blood found on the evidence samples resulted from contamination in the LAPD crime lab with the reference blood in all but three exhibits. The remaining three exhibits that couldn't be explained by contamination were planted by the police. Although evidence of mistakes made during collection were shown at trial, no evidence of their contamination or corruption claim was presented. \n\nThe contamination claim was dependent on all the blood in the case being 100% degraded and the real killers DNA lost. If that didn't happen, contamination would only produce a mixture of Simpsons  DNA and the killers. The contamination claim likewise would spread EDTA to the evidence samples which could be tested for as it was a preservative found in the reference vials of Simpson and the two victims. The contamination claim was also limited to just the LAPD crime lab as it was not alleged at the two consulting labs, the state department and Cellmarks diagnostics, were most of the DNA testing was done. The defense also declined to test the samples themselves for the \u201creal killers\u201d DNA or for EDTA.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=DNA%20evidence&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

Using a reference article from the EPA, he testified that because the amount of EDTA in that blood is measured in \"parts-per-million\" (PPM) and the reference article states normally EDTA in the blood should only be detectable in \"parts-per-billion\" (PPB), the evidence blood contains a thousand times more EDTA than it should.

As evidence they offered the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in purple top tubes used for blood draws, it was collected several weeks later on July 3, rather than on June 13, and 1.5mL of Simpsons donated reference blood was unaccounted for. The officer who planted it was not named by the defense. The prosecution countered that the EDTA levels found in the blood was consistent with that found normally in unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels found in blood preserved in a purple top tube. A different photograph of the gate on June 13 shows the blood was already there and the claim of some of Simpsons reference blood missing from the vial was refuted during rebuttal by the nurse who drew it who clarified he believes he only drew the amount the records show was used for testing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=Now%20the%20prosecution%20had%20a%20response&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

As evidence they offered that Vannatter did have possession of Nicole Browns autopsy blood briefly prior to booking it into evidence and the blood contained EDTA, a preservative found in the reference vial of Nicole Brown autopsy blood. The claim was refuted by the defenses own witness, FBI special agent Roger Martz who showed the level of EDTA in that blood drop is consistent with unpreserved blood and not even close to the levels that would be seen in blood from a purple top tube. The prosecution also countered that no blood was ever claimed to be missing from Nicole Browns reference vial and that the records show Detective Vannatter booked the reference vials from the victims immediately into evidence right after receiving it from Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Irwin Golden. Dr. Cotton conclusively refuted that claim by showing the blood in the reference vial is substantially more degraded than the blood on the sock, proving it did not come from that vial.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bewick, Dr Michael, (born 11 Sept. 1956), Deputy Medical Director, NHS England, since 2013|date=2014-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u279641|work=Who's Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref>\n==== Rockingham Glove ====\nThe defense claimed the bloody glove found at Simpsons Rockingham estate was planted by Detective Mark Fuhrman who said he found it there.

Thus, if Fuhrman planted the glove at Rockingham from the crime scene, that means Simpsons blood was at the crime scene which contradicts his claim he was home that night. Fuhrman's DNA was also not found on the glove which supports his claim he did not plant it. The prosecution argued that Fuhrman didn't plant the glove because he didn't know if Simpson had an air-tight alibi that night. Vincent Bugliosi concurs with the prosecutors argument noting as well that Fuhrman did not know whose blood was on it at the time either.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS_ZCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=o+j+run+of+his+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0_Ia6sMTkAhUSCawKHfWXBJ8Q6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=fuhrman&f=false|title=The Run of His Life: The People V.

He said they did prove Vannatter planted Nicole Browns blood on the sock despite Dr. Cotton debunking that claim at the civil trial. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\nDefense attorney Carl Douglas stated the racial gap concerning Simpsons guilt is shrinking for two reasons: his celebrity status has faded among Africans Americans and greater acceptance of DNA evidence as reliable.

Unlike the other experts in this case, Gerdes did not enjoy publicity from the trial because his claim that forensic DNA testing is unreliable was not true.

Photos of the crime scene show the blood was there hours before blood from Simpson was taken so it wasn't planted. The blood was collected and shipped directly to the state department lab, not the LAPD lab, so contamination couldn't explain it and the blood was testable so it wasn't compromised and Dr. Cotton said the chances it wasn't Simpsons was 1-in-9.7 billion.\n\nForeman Amanda Cooley responded she had no explanation for that incriminating evidence and it didn't factor into their reasonable doubt decision, implying she ignored it. \n\nJuror Marsha Rubin-Jackson responded she thinks Simpsons blood was left there next to the bloody footprints prior to the murders happening. The defense never suggested this and Simpson said he was never there that day.\n\nJuror Carrie Bess responded that she thinks the blood belonged to Simpsons children. Dr Cotton said the chances of it being anyone else other than O.J. Simpson was 1-in-9.7 billion.    \n\n====Lionel \"Lion\" Cryer ====\nLionel \"Lion\" Cryer was one of the jurors who came out strong for Simpsons innocence during deliberations and afterwards. Since then, he stated he does now believe that Simpsons is guilty of the murders. He admitted that what he thought at the time was a reasonable doubt of the DNA evidence really wasn't and that is the hardest thing to admit to now because the media has portrayed the jurors as incompetent since the trial and no answer he gives for why he doubted the blood evidence will make that impression any better.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etonline.com/news/221848_oj_simpson_juror_says_he_endured_intense_therapy_after_murder_trial_talks_not_guilty_verdict|title=EXCLUSIVE: OJ Simpson Juror Says He Underwent Intense Therapy After Murder Trial, Talks Not-Guilty Verdict|website=Entertainment Tonight|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oj-juror-who-raised-black-power-fist-salute-black-panther/|title=OJ Juror Who Raised Black Power Fist Was a Black Panther|date=2016-04-06|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\nHe stated that portion of the trial dragged on longer than most people realize.

It was written by Trainor, [[Ricky Reed|Eric Frederic]], and Jacob Kasher Hindlin, and produced by [[Ricky Reed]]. The track was released on March 4, 2016, as the lead single from the album. Backed by a guitar instrumentation, the [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song draws some influences from [[doo-wop]], with lyrics about unwanted advances from men towards women.\n\nIts composition was compared by several critics to the music of various pop artists of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[NSYNC]]. \"No\" was a commercial success, becoming Trainor's second single to reach the top three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number three. It also reached the top ten in several European countries (Austria, Spain, Scotland), as well as in Australia and Canada.\n\n[[Fatima Robinson]] directed the [[music video]] for \"No\". It was set at a warehouse, noted to be visually darker than Trainor's previous clips and featured her dancing alongside an all-female dance troupe. The clip drew comparisons to the works of Spears and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for its sexual nature. Trainor has performed \"No\" on several shows, including the [[3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards]], ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards|2016 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. She also performed it during [[The Untouchable Tour]] (2016).\n\n==Background and release==\nReferring to her meeting with label director [[L.A.

It was written by Trainor, [[Ricky Reed|Eric Frederic]], and Jacob Kasher Hindlin, and produced by [[Ricky Reed]]. The track was released on March 4, 2016, as the lead single from the album. Backed by a guitar instrumentation, the [[dance-pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] song draws some influences from [[doo-wop]], with lyrics about unwanted advances from men towards women.\n\nIts composition was compared by several critics to the music of various pop artists of the late 1990s and early 2000s, such as [[Britney Spears]] and [[NSYNC]]. \"No\" was a commercial success, becoming Trainor's second single to reach the top three on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number three. It also reached the top ten in several European countries (Austria, Spain, Scotland), as well as in Australia and Canada.\n\n[[Fatima Robinson]] directed the [[music video]] for \"No\". It was set at a warehouse, noted to be visually darker than Trainor's previous clips and featured her dancing alongside an all-female dance troupe. The clip drew comparisons to the works of Spears and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for its sexual nature. Trainor has performed \"No\" on several shows, including the [[3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards]], ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and the [[2016 Billboard Music Awards|2016 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. She also performed it during [[The Untouchable Tour]] (2016).\n\n==Background and release==\nReferring to her meeting with label director [[L.A. Reid]], [[Meghan Trainor]] revealed that he had told the singer she then lacked a proper lead single for her upcoming album, and that she \"[had] an album of Nice Meghan\".<ref name=\"O'Donnell\" /> Trainor said it took little time to craft the song with producer Ricky Reed, explaining that she told him that they \"needed a big eff-you song, an anthem about girl power that sounded like nothing on the album\".<ref name=\"O'Donnell\" /> The duo wrote \"No\" the same day. She went into the studio wanting to write a \"big, angry anthem\", but described the final product as an anthem about independence for women.<ref name=\"Glam\" >{{cite web |last=Arneson |first=Krystin |title=Meghan Trainor Just Dropped a Sassy New Single That's Perfect for Your Girls' Night Out |url=https://www.glamour.com/story/meghan-trainor-just-dropped-a |website=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]] |accessdate=September 25, 2018 |date=March 5, 2016}}</ref> Trainor added that she will \"never forget that moment\" when she was \"too scared\" to play it for Reid, but he played it more than 29 times.<ref name=\"O'Donnell\" >{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/04/meghan-trainor-new-song-no | title=Meghan Trainor returns with 'big eff-you' song 'No' | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=March 4, 2016 | accessdate=March 4, 2016 | author=O'Donnell, Kevin}}</ref> Ultimately, the song changed the direction of its parent album, as they started experimenting with new musical styles and produced six more tracks.<ref name=\"latimes\"/>\n\nTrainor stated in December 2015, that she had almost completed her second major-label studio album, describing the material as \"something that's not on the radio\" and \"different\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Garibaldi |first=Christina|title=Meghan Trainor Has A Lot Of 'Big Songs' On Her Next Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2685881/meghan-trainor-big-songs-second-album/|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=December 10, 2015|date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> She began teasing the lead single on [[Twitter]] in late January 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lee |first=Christina |title=Meghan Trainor Teases Debut Single Off Sophomore Album |url=https://www.idolator.com/7621903/meghan-trainor-2016-music-no |publisher=[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] |accessdate=April 11, 2020 |date=January 31, 2016}}</ref> In a [[Fuse (TV channel)|Fuse]] interview published on February 2, Trainor confirmed the song title as \"No\" along with a March release date, and stated that it is an anthem for women about telling a man that they are \"out here on [their] own\" and good with it.

After locating the child's corpse, the hunter took cover in a tree overlooking the body, expecting the killer to come back for its prize.\n\nThe leopard returned after nightfall, and took refuge in undergrowth to prevent the hunter from finding him. After retreating when the hunter fired a warning shot, the leopard returned several times, though attempts to kill it were unsuccessful.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sickchirpse.com/top-5-deadliest-man-eating-animals-body-count/|title=Top 5 Deadliest Man-Eating Animals By Body Count|last=SickChirpse|date=2014-03-31|website=Sick Chirpse|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nThe British hunter eventually abandoned the chase after believing the leopard had begun to stalk his tent.<ref name=\":1\" /> Three days later, the leopard was killed when it approached a farmer, who used a projectile shot from a gas pipe to mortally wound it. The hunter, before he left for Britain, purchased the carcass and found human hair in its stomach, confirming it as a man-eater. He later noted that the fur and claws were in surprisingly good condition, in contrast with what should have been expected from an older animal. There were no signs of past injuries which could have prevented it from hunting, thus leaving the hunter to conclude that the leopard had probably been fed human flesh as a cub by its mother, a likely man-eater herself.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[Category:Central Provinces]]\n[[Category:Deaths due to leopard attacks|Central Provinces]]\n[[Category:Man-eaters of India]]\n[[Category:Individual leopards]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Madhya Pradesh]]\n[[Category:Individual wild animals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=February 2011}}\n{{One source|date=February 2020}}\n}}\nThe '''Leopard of the Central Provinces''', also known as the '''Devilish Cunning Panther''', was a [[Man-eater|man-eating]]  male [[Indian leopard]] which over the course of a couple of years, killed over 150 people, all women and children, in the [[Central Provinces]] of [[British India]] in the early 20th century. The leopard reportedly claimed a victim once every 2\u20133 days, each time in a different area to the last, with the killings sometimes taking place 20\u201330 miles apart. The leopard caused such panic that the native communities in its range rarely left their homes alone or unarmed.\n\n==Hunt for the leopard==\nAn unnamed British hunter set up headquarters in a large village, where he compiled information on the leopard's depredations with the local ''[[Police station|thana]]''. Ten days later, a man entered the hunter's camp one morning, and claimed that the leopard had entered a hut in a village a mile from the camp, and had unsuccessfully attempted to carry off a small girl the previous night. The hunter dressed the girl's wounds and she recovered. The leopard struck again two days later in another village. The hunter searched for the leopard from his camp for three weeks without success.\n\nWith the body count rising, the hunter considered moving camp, until a boy from a village four miles away came to him, and stated that the leopard had dragged off his brother when they were driving cattle. At 14:00, the hunter set himself on a tree overlooking the boy's corpse, in the hope that the leopard would return for it. The leopard came at night, though the hunter was unable to get a clear shot due to the darkness, and the canopy of dense creeper vine. The hunter attempted to startle the leopard into coming out for a clear shot, but all attempts failed to intimidate the leopard, even firing in the air had no effect. The shots got the attention of the villagers, but the hunter called at them to clear the area. After a few hours, the hunter fell asleep at 1:00, and upon waking, found the leopard clawing at the foot of the tree. The leopard left after a few moments, but returned three hours later to finish its meal. By sunrise, all that remained of the boy's body were hands, feet and a few bones. The hunter attempted to track down the leopard in case it was still in the area, but after a search spanning one mile, he gave up. A few days later, the hunter moved camp ten miles away, hoping for more success. On the second night of his arrival, the hunter was awoken from his sleep by the leopard scratching outside his tent, though it was driven off by the shouting of the villagers.\n\n==Death and post mortem==\nThree days later, the leopard attacked the goats of a Gond farmer, but was driven off. Upon shortly returning however, it was fatally shot with a projectile propelled from a gas pipe five yards away from it. The Gond presented the hunter with the leopard's skin and stomach contents, among which was a ball of human hair, thus confirming it as the man-eater. The hunter purchased the hide for 10 rupees, later noting that the fur and claws were in fine condition, not what was to be expected from an old, infirm animal. There were no signs of past injuries which could have prevented it from hunting, thus leaving the hunter to conclude that the leopard had probably been fed human flesh as a cub by its mother, a likely man-eater herself.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leopard attack]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |editor=Bethell, L.
