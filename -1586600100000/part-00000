He was the first son of [[Maharaja]] [[Rao Jodha]] of the Rathore clan, the founder of [[Jodhpur]] and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the [[Thar Desert]], Bikaner was considered an [[oasis]] on the trade route between [[Central Asia]] and the [[Gujarat]] coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (\"the settlement of Bika\") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5&nbsp;km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.<ref name=Ring>{{Cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Robert M.

During the [[Mughal Empire]]'s rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the [[suzerainty]] of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor [[Akbar]] and his son the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Rai Singh's successful military exploits, which involved winning half of [[Mewar|Mewar kingdom]] for the Empire, won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was given the [[jagir]]s (lands) of Gujarat and [[Burhanpur]]. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the Chintamani Durg (Junagarh fort) on a plain which has an average elevation of {{convert|760|ft|m}}. He was an expert in arts and architecture, and the knowledge he acquired during his visits abroad is amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built at the Junagarh fort.<ref name=Ring/><ref name=history/><ref name=Juna>{{cite web|url=http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|title=Junagarh Fort, Bikaner|accessdate=7 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416053153/http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|archivedate=16 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nMaharaja Karan Singh, who ruled from 1631 to 1639, under the suzerainty of the Mughals, built the Karan Mahal palace. Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. Anup Singh Ji, who ruled from 1669 to 1698, made substantial additions to the fort complex, with new palaces and the [[Zenana]] quarter, a royal dwelling for women and children. He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Maharaja Gaj Singh, who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon Palace).\n\nDuring the 18th century, there was an internecine war between the rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also amongst other [[Thakur (Indian title)|thakurs]], which was put down by British troops.<ref name=history/>\n\nFollowing Maharaja Gaj Singh, Maharaja Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and lavishly decorated the audience hall (see illustration) with glass and lively paintwork. Under a [[subsidiary alliance|treaty of paramountcy]] signed in 1818, during Maharaja Surat Singh's reign, Bikaner came under the [[suzerainty]] of the British, after which the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily in refurbishing Junagarh fort.<ref name=\"Ring p.133\">Ring p.133</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Lalgarh palace bikaner.jpg\n| width1 = 230\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Imperialwarcabinet-bordonhu.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Lalgarh Palace]], built ([[Indo-Saracenic]] style) for Maharaja [[Ganga Singh]] and named after his father, presently a heritage hotel and also a residence of the [[Bikaner (princely state)|Bikaner]] Royal Family.

He was the first son of [[Maharaja]] [[Rao Jodha]] of the Rathore clan, the founder of [[Jodhpur]] and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the [[Thar Desert]], Bikaner was considered an [[oasis]] on the trade route between [[Central Asia]] and the [[Gujarat]] coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (\"the settlement of Bika\") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5&nbsp;km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.<ref name=Ring>{{Cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Robert M.
