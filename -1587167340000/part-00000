It was written and composed, as a collaboration among all the members of the band, for their second album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. Built around a piano [[riff]], the song features cryptic lyrics concerning themes of contrast and urgency. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].\n\nThe record debuted to critical and commercial success, with critics mainly commenting on the song's piano melody, and winning the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. It was released in the United Kingdom as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', where it reached number nine in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was released in the United States as the album's second single, it reached number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Considered to be one of Coldplay's [[signature song]]s, \"Clocks\" continues to garner critical acclaim, and is often placed on lists ranking the greatest songs of the 2000s and of all time, including being ranked 490th on [[Rolling Stone]]'s \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" list in 2010.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/coldplay-clocks-19691231|title=Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Songs' List|accessdate=7 September 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed during the late stages of production of [[Coldplay]]'s second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. A [[riff]] popped into [[Chris Martin]]'s mind late one night in Liverpool when he came into the studio, where he then developed it on piano. According to Martin, \"Clocks\" was inspired by the English rock band [[Muse (band)|Muse]].<ref name=\"EzineChris\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coldplay.com/content/ezine/documents/ezine6.pdf|title=Chris talks us through Rush A Rush of Blood to the Head|date=November 2002|work=Coldplay.com|format=PDF|accessdate=19 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808184853/http://www.coldplay.com/content/ezine/documents/ezine6.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2006}}</ref> Martin presented the riff to the band's guitarist, [[Jonny Buckland]], who then added a layer of [[guitar chord]]s to the basic track:<ref name=\"Wiederhorn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484768/20040202/coldplay.jhtml|title=Road to the Grammys: The Making Of Coldplay's 'Clocks'|last=Wiederhorn|first=Jon|date=2 February 2004|work=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=13 July 2008}}</ref> \"He picked up his guitar [a sure sign that he likes a song] and played these brilliant chords&nbsp;...

However, Martin felt it was \"rubbish\"; they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release.<ref name=\"Webb\"/> After a headlining tour, Coldplay went on working \"Songs for #3\". [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], the band's manager and a friend of Martin, heard it and pressed him to rework \"Clocks\" immediately.

It was written and composed, as a collaboration among all the members of the band, for their second album ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. Built around a piano [[riff]], the song features cryptic lyrics concerning themes of contrast and urgency. Several remixes of the track exist and its riff has been widely [[Sampling (music)|sampled]].\n\nThe record debuted to critical and commercial success, with critics mainly commenting on the song's piano melody, and winning the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]. It was released in the United Kingdom as the third [[Single (music)|single]] from ''A Rush of Blood to the Head'', where it reached number nine in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was released in the United States as the album's second single, it reached number 29 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number 9 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. Considered to be one of Coldplay's [[signature song]]s, \"Clocks\" continues to garner critical acclaim, and is often placed on lists ranking the greatest songs of the 2000s and of all time, including being ranked 490th on [[Rolling Stone]]'s \"[[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]\" list in 2010.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/coldplay-clocks-19691231|title=Rolling Stone's '500 Greatest Songs' List|accessdate=7 September 2011|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n== Background and writing ==\n\"Clocks\" was written and composed during the late stages of production of [[Coldplay]]'s second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]''. A [[riff]] popped into [[Chris Martin]]'s mind late one night in Liverpool when he came into the studio, where he then developed it on piano.

However, Martin felt it was \"rubbish\"; they were so far from being completely satisfied with the album that both the band and Parlophone delayed the release.<ref name=\"Webb\"/> After a headlining tour, Coldplay went on working \"Songs for #3\". [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], the band's manager and a friend of Martin, heard it and pressed him to rework \"Clocks\" immediately. Harvey pointed out that, with its lyrics that speak of urgency, its meaning contradicted Martin's idea of stashing the track.<ref name=\"Wiederhorn\"/><ref name=\"Webb\"/> Thus persuaded by Harvey, Martin then further developed \"Clocks\", while other band members supplemented his work with their ideas based on the main piano track, adding [[bass guitar|bass]] and drums.

She gathered the folktales, stories, and archaic dialects of the rural communities she visited in her home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and wove them into her first novel, ''[[Lamb in His Bosom]]'', for which she won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1934. Her success as the first Georgian winner<ref name=\"Asheville\"/> of the fiction prize inspired [[Macmillan Publishers]] to seek out more southern writers, resulting in the discovery of [[Margaret Mitchell]], whose first novel, ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', also won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937.\n\n==Early years and education==\nCaroline Pafford was born on August 26, 1903, in [[Waycross, Georgia]], to Elias Pafford and Levy Zan (Hall) Pafford.<ref name=\"NGE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/caroline-miller-1903-1992|title=Caroline Miller (1903-1992)|publisher=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|author= Carey O.

During the remaining years of school, she was raised by her older sisters.<ref name=\"Women\" />\n\nIn her high school years, Caroline expressed an interest in writing and in the performing arts. She never attended college.  After graduating from high school she married William D. Miller,<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://studylib.net/doc/11062682/|title=The Pandora|publisher=1919 Graduating Law Class - [[University of Georgia]]|page=59|date=1919|accessdate=February 17, 2020}}</ref> who was her English teacher, and moved to [[Baxley, Georgia]], in the late 1920s, where her husband ultimately became superintendent of schools in the Baxley area.<ref name=\"NGE\" /> William Miller introduced Caroline to classical literature, and she would later say that \"he was my college\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> The couple had three sons, two of whom were twins. During her early years of marriage, while raising her children and performing her domestic duties, Miller wrote short stories, an activity first begun in high school. The stories were well received, and the small amounts she received supplemented the family income.<ref name=\"NGE\" />\n\n==First novel and Pulitzer Prize==\nMiller gathered much of the material for ''Lamb in His Bosom'' while she was buying chickens and eggs tens of miles in the backwoods.<ref name=\"Fame\" /> She recorded her local research and [[genealogy]] in a notebook while she traveled throughout the south Georgia countryside.<ref name=\"NGE\" /> She collected folktales and family oral histories, as well as [[idiomatic|idiomatic expressions]] which would eventually color the text of her novel.<ref name=\"Virginia\" /> Her initial work was done when \"returning to Baxley, she would go to Barnes Drugstore, order a Coca-Cola, and write down the stories she had heard on the day's trip\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.southernliterarytrail.org/writers/caroline-miller|title=Caroline Miller|publisher=Southern Literary Trail|date=|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> then she would slowly flesh out her novel in the quiet hours of the evening on her kitchen table.<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"Women\" /><ref name=\"Fame\" /> While stories from the backwoods became part of the fabric of her novel, Miller also drew upon the inspiring tales of the pioneer women in her own family history.<ref name=\"Fame\" /><ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nUpon completion of the novel, Miller began looking for a publisher. During this search, she met former Pulitzer Prize winner [[Julia Peterkin]], who read Miller's manuscript and forwarded her name and manuscript to her own agent. ''Lamb in His Bosom'' was subsequently published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]] in 1933.<ref name=\"Virginia\">{{cite web|url=https://bestsellers.lib.virginia.edu/submissions/338|title=20th Century American Bestsellers - Miller, Caroline: Lamb in His Bosom (researched by Mary Unger)|publisher=[[University of Virginia]]|date=|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Lamb in His Bosom'' is a story about the struggles of poor white pioneers, in the [[Wiregrass Region]] of nineteenth-century southern Georgia.<ref name=\"NGE\" /> Upon publication, literary critics embraced the work, describing it as \"regional historical realism\".<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"Fame\" /> ''[[The New York Times]]''' critic [[Louis Kronenberger]] said the novel \"has a wonderful freshness about it; not simply the freshness of a new writer, but the freshness of a new world.

Miller told the audience that \"she felt like Cinderella and that the success of her book seemed like a fairy tale\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> Upon her return to Baxley, she was greeted by a crowd of 2,500 and a marching band, which escorted her back to her home.<ref name=\"Women\" /> [[Margaret Mitchell]] wrote to Miller, saying: \"Your book is undoubtedly the greatest that ever came out of the South about Southern people, and it is my favorite book\".<ref name=\"Asheville\" /> In 1935, Miller was also honored with a French literary award, the [[Prix Femina|Prix Femina Americain]].<ref name=\"FloraVogel1980\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph M.

The obligations and attention imposed upon Caroline were incompatible with the quiet, simple, existence that she and William had enjoyed prior to her fame. In 1936, the couple divorced. Caroline remarried one year later to Clyde H. Ray Jr., an antique dealer and florist. The couple moved to [[Waynesville, North Carolina]], where Caroline helped out in the family business while continuing to write short stories and articles for newspapers and magazines, such as ''[[Pictorial Review]]'' and ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''.<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"FloraVogel1980\" /> They had one daughter and a son.<ref name=\"Fame\" />\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1944, Miller finished her second novel, ''Lebanon'', which garnered mixed reviews from the critics. Although constructed along the lines of her earlier work, set in rural Georgia, the new novel had a romantic storyline which was criticized as being awkward and unrealistic.<ref name=\"NGE\" />\n\nAfter her second husband died, Miller moved to a remote mountain home. It was described as \"so remote that visitors had to drive through a cow pasture taking care to close a maze of gates behind them\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> In the decades that followed, Miller continued to write, completing several manuscripts. But she never sought to publish them. For the most part, she lived a quiet, private life in her mountain home in western North Carolina.<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"Women\" />\n\n==Death and legacy==  \n[[File:Caroline Pafford Miller historical marker.jpg|thumb|Historical marker in Baxley, Appling County, Georgia]]\nMiller died on July 12, 1992, in [[Waynesville, North Carolina]], at the age of 88.

She gathered the folktales, stories, and archaic dialects of the rural communities she visited in her home state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and wove them into her first novel, ''[[Lamb in His Bosom]]'', for which she won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1934. Her success as the first Georgian winner<ref name=\"Asheville\"/> of the fiction prize inspired [[Macmillan Publishers]] to seek out more southern writers, resulting in the discovery of [[Margaret Mitchell]], whose first novel, ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', also won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1937.\n\n==Early years and education==\nCaroline Pafford was born on August 26, 1903, in [[Waycross, Georgia]], to Elias Pafford and Levy Zan (Hall) Pafford.<ref name=\"NGE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/caroline-miller-1903-1992|title=Caroline Miller (1903-1992)|publisher=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]]|author= Carey O.

During her early years of marriage, while raising her children and performing her domestic duties, Miller wrote short stories, an activity first begun in high school. The stories were well received, and the small amounts she received supplemented the family income.<ref name=\"NGE\" />\n\n==First novel and Pulitzer Prize==\nMiller gathered much of the material for ''Lamb in His Bosom'' while she was buying chickens and eggs tens of miles in the backwoods.<ref name=\"Fame\" /> She recorded her local research and [[genealogy]] in a notebook while she traveled throughout the south Georgia countryside.<ref name=\"NGE\" /> She collected folktales and family oral histories, as well as [[idiomatic|idiomatic expressions]] which would eventually color the text of her novel.<ref name=\"Virginia\" /> Her initial work was done when \"returning to Baxley, she would go to Barnes Drugstore, order a Coca-Cola, and write down the stories she had heard on the day's trip\";<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.southernliterarytrail.org/writers/caroline-miller|title=Caroline Miller|publisher=Southern Literary Trail|date=|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> then she would slowly flesh out her novel in the quiet hours of the evening on her kitchen table.<ref name=\"NGE\" /><ref name=\"Women\" /><ref name=\"Fame\" /> While stories from the backwoods became part of the fabric of her novel, Miller also drew upon the inspiring tales of the pioneer women in her own family history.<ref name=\"Fame\" /><ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nUpon completion of the novel, Miller began looking for a publisher.

The obligations and attention imposed upon Caroline were incompatible with the quiet, simple, existence that she and William had enjoyed prior to her fame. In 1936, the couple divorced. Caroline remarried one year later to Clyde H. Ray Jr., an antique dealer and florist.

Although constructed along the lines of her earlier work, set in rural Georgia, the new novel had a romantic storyline which was criticized as being awkward and unrealistic.<ref name=\"NGE\" />\n\nAfter her second husband died, Miller moved to a remote mountain home. It was described as \"so remote that visitors had to drive through a cow pasture taking care to close a maze of gates behind them\".<ref name=\"Women\" /> In the decades that followed, Miller continued to write, completing several manuscripts.

{"title_page": "IB Diploma Programme", "text_new": "{{short description|Educational programme}}\n{{other uses|Baccalaureate (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{IB}}\nThe '''International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme''' ('''IBDP''') is a two-year [[Curriculum|educational programme]] primarily aimed at 16-to-19-year-olds. The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. \n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received. It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper claims that the IBDP is \"more academically challenging and broader than three or four [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]\".<ref name=\"guardian-2009-02-10\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/10/international-baccalaureate-moved-amsterdam|title=Leap from Cardiff to Amsterdam for Baccalaureate|work=Guardian.co.uk|first=Jessica|last=Shepard|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==History and background==\nIn 1945 the \"Conference of Internationally-minded Schools\" asked the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) to create an international schools programme.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\">Peterson p. 17</ref><ref>Fox p. 5</ref> When he became director of Ecolint's English division, Desmond Cole-Baker began to develop the idea, and in 1962, his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva, at which the term \"International Baccalaureate\" was first mentioned.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\"/><ref>HIll, 2007 p. 19</ref> An American social studies teacher, Leach organized the conference\u2014with a $2500 grant from [[UNESCO]]\u2014which was attended by observers from European schools and [[UNESCO]]. Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in ''Schools Across Frontiers'', [[Alec Peterson]] credits Leach as \"the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate.\"<ref>Peterson p. 18</ref>  At the end of the conference, Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $10,000, which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers, or bring teachers together for meetings.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\">Peterson p. 18-26</ref>\n[[File:Ecolintchateau.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau at [[Ecolint]] where [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was developed.]]\n\nBy 1964, international educators such as [[Alec Peterson]] (director of the Department of Education at [[Oxford University]]), [[Harlan Hanson]] (director of the [[AP Program|College Board Advanced Placement Program]]), Desmond Cole (director of [[United Nations International School]] in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES).<ref name=\"Fox65-75\">Fox, pp. 65-75</ref><ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\">Mathews, p. 22</ref> Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience from a long relationship with the [[College Board]].<ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\"/> According to Peterson, \"the breakthrough in the history of the IB\" came in 1965 with a grant from the [[The Century Foundation|Twentieth Century Fund]], which commissioned [[Martin Mayer (writer)|Martin Mayer]], author of ''The Schools'', to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for [[international school]]s that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> This led to conferences involving Ecolint, [[Atlantic College|United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College)]], and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/>\n\nThe Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's study at Oxford University, which focused on three issues: a comparative analysis of \"secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe\"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a \"statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as [[GCE Advanced Level|British A Levels]] and [[AP Program|US College Board (AP) Tests]]\".<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/><ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at [[Atlantic College|UWC Atlantic College]], Peterson initiated the pattern of combining \"general education with specialization\", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the \"curriculum framework\"  proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967.<ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> Late in 1967, ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> In 1967, the group, which by then also included [[Ralph W.

The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. \n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received.

After his release, Radke subsequently became the lead singer of a new band, [[Falling in Reverse]]. As a solo musician, Radke released [[rap]] mixtape, ''Watch Me'', in 2014, which included collaborations with [[Deuce (singer)|Deuce]], {{notatypo|b.LaY}}, [[Tyler Carter]], [[Sy Ari Da Kid]], [[Jacoby Shaddix]], [[Danny Worsnop]], [[Andy Biersack]], and [[Craig Mabbitt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/falling-in-reverse-ronnie-radke-new-song-star-studded-mixtape/|title=Falling in Reverse's Ronnie Radke Offers Free Song Download From Star-Studded Mixtape|website=Loudwire}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nRonald Joseph Radke was born on December 15, 1983, in [[St. Rose Hospital]], in [[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]], one of three children born to Russell Radke, the others being his brothers, Anthony James Radke (1980-2013) and Matthew Radke.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://musicjunkiepress.com/breaking-news/rest-in-peace-anthony-james-radke-older-brother-of-ronnie-radke/|title=Rest in Peace Anthony James Radke, older brother of Ronnie Radke - Music Junkie Press|date=August 11, 2013|newspaper=Music Junkie Press|language=en-US|access-date=January 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://peabodykansas.com/direct/anthony_radke+4447radke+416e74686f6e79205261646b65|title=Anthony Radke {{!}} Peabody Gazette-Bulletin {{!}} Aug. 15, 2013|website=peabodykansas.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}</ref> Radke's mother abused drugs and was absent from his childhood, which he said caused him to have a general lack of respect towards women as an adult although he later forgave her when he posted a picture of her on Instagram after a Falling in Reverse show in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rocksound.tv/features/read/an-honest-conversation-with-ronnie-radke-part-2-im-not-this-egotistical-tyr|title=An Honest Conversation With Ronnie Radke, Part 2: I\u2019m Not This Egotistical, Tyrannical Person\u2019 - Features - Rock Sound Magazine|work=Rock Sound Magazine|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}</ref> Radke is part [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot Indian]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BYwgtPCgKS4/|title=Ronnie Radke on Instagram: \u201cSorry I just realized the sizes were sold out, just restocked them* This is photo shopped and no I'm not Asian, I'm Blackfoot Indian and\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n\nRadke learned to play piano and guitar in his first bands. He began by playing Blink-182 songs on guitar. The first song he could play was \"Dammit\". He formed several bands while in high school. Radke ran away from home to play in his first band, with his friend Mitch, called 3.0. which according to Radke \"sounded exactly like Blink 182\". He lived with Mitch and his mother for a time. They played a few shows at various venues such as Chain Reaction and the Huntridge in Las Vegas. After the band, Radke moved back in with his dad, re-entered school, and dropped out again. He stated in an Alternative Press interview, \"I just couldn't for some reason pay attention; I just daydreamed about everything else but what I'm supposed to be doing.\" Radke stated that the second band that he was in was called Lefty. Radke met Max Green (from the band Almost Heroes) at a talent show. Radke's microphone fell and Max picked it up for him while they were on stage and they became friends, forming the band True Story, which recorded a demo containing the track \"This Is Not the End\". Radke started screaming in the band after being inspired by Thrice, then started to sing, slowly forming Escape the Fate.\n\n\"Listen Up!\" was written by Radke in 1998 as well as \"Besides the Issues\" and \"The Worst Time\". In 2001, Radke, with his friend, producer Michael \"Elvis\" Baskette, recorded the songs \"Listen Up!\", \"The Worst Time\" and \"The Departure\".  Both recorded instruments together and also composed the themes for \"As You're Falling Down\", \"Make Up\" and \"Not Good Enough for Truth in Cliche\", recorded in 2005, along with Escape the Fate.\n\n==History==\n\n===Escape the Fate (2004\u20132008)===\nIn high school, Radke and [[Max Green (musician)|Max Green]] were close friends. In 2004, Bryan Money, looking for a vocalist, contacted Max who referred him to Radke. Bryan agreed and began auditions for a drummer. Robert Ortiz was selected, and [[Escape The Fate|Escape the Fate]] was formed. A few weeks later, [[Omar Espinosa]], who at the time was the guitarist for [[Lovehatehero]], joined as rhythm guitarist. The band began to play in the [[post-hardcore]] scene in Las Vegas. During that time [[Carson Allen]] joined as keyboardist. The band recorded the demo ''[[Escape the Fate (demo album)|Escape the Fate EP]]''. They signed in early 2006 with [[Epitaph Records]] after winning a radio contest judged by [[My Chemical Romance]], which launched their career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/escape_the_fate/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|title=MTV Artist's, Escape the Fate Bio|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2006, recording for the EP ''[[There's No Sympathy for the Dead]]'' began, as well as some songs from the debut album, ''[[Dying Is Your Latest Fashion]]''.

He began by playing Blink-182 songs on guitar. The first song he could play was \"Dammit\". He formed several bands while in high school. Radke ran away from home to play in his first band, with his friend Mitch, called 3.0. which according to Radke \"sounded exactly like Blink 182\". He lived with Mitch and his mother for a time. They played a few shows at various venues such as Chain Reaction and the Huntridge in Las Vegas. After the band, Radke moved back in with his dad, re-entered school, and dropped out again. He stated in an Alternative Press interview, \"I just couldn't for some reason pay attention; I just daydreamed about everything else but what I'm supposed to be doing.\" Radke stated that the second band that he was in was called Lefty. Radke met Max Green (from the band Almost Heroes) at a talent show. Radke's microphone fell and Max picked it up for him while they were on stage and they became friends, forming the band True Story, which recorded a demo containing the track \"This Is Not the End\". Radke started screaming in the band after being inspired by Thrice, then started to sing, slowly forming Escape the Fate.\n\n\"Listen Up!\" was written by Radke in 1998 as well as \"Besides the Issues\" and \"The Worst Time\".

The only battle to take place in Charlottesville was the [[Battle of Rio Hill|skirmish at Rio Hill]], an encounter in which [[George Armstrong Custer]] briefly engaged local [[Confederate Home Guard]]<nowiki/>s before retreating. A year later, the Charlottesville Factory, founded c. 1820\u201330, was accidentally burnt during General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s 1865 raid through the Shenandoah Valley, although the mayor had surrendered the city to Generals Custer and Sheridan to keep the town from being burned. The factory had been taken over by the Confederacy and used to manufacture woolen clothing for the soldiers. It caught fire when some coals taken by Union troops to burn the nearby railroad bridge dropped on the floor. The factory was rebuilt immediately and was known as the Woolen Mills until its liquidation in 1962.<ref name=\"MonicaCalif.)1998\">{{cite book\n|author1=Museum of African American Art (Santa Monica, Calif.)\n|author2=Hampton University (Va.)

The Virginia Men's team won their first [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Championship]] in 1972; in 2006, they won their fourth National Championship and were the first team to finish undefeated in 17 games (then a record for wins). The team won its fifth National Championship in 2011. Virginia's Women's team has three [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Championships]] to its credit, with wins in 1991, 1993, and 2004. The soccer program is also strong; the Men's team shared a national title with Santa Clara in 1989 and won an unprecedented four consecutive NCAA Division I Championships (1991\u20131994). Their coach during that period was [[Bruce Arena]], who later won two MLS titles at D.C. United and coached the U.S. National Team during the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. The Virginia Men's soccer team won the NCAA Championship again in both [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2009]] and [[2014 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2014]] under coach [[George Gelnovatch]]. Virginia's [[baseball]] team, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, under Head Coach Brian O'Connor, after hosting several regionals and Super Regionals in the post-season, and playing in the 2009, 2011, and [[2014 College World Series]]. They finished as runners-up in the 2014 edition, despite outscoring [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] 17\u201312 in the three-game series. The team then avenged this loss the following year, beating Vanderbilt in 2015 for its first NCAA baseball title.\n\nCharlottesville area high school sports have been prominent throughout the state. Charlottesville is a hotbed for lacrosse in the country, with teams such as [[St. Anne's-Belfield School]], [[The Covenant School (Virginia)|The Covenant School]], [[Tandem Friends School]], [[Charlottesville Catholic School]], [[Charlottesville High School]], [[Western Albemarle High School]] and [[Albemarle High School (Virginia)|Albemarle High School]].

I-64 heads east to [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and west to [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. US 29 heads southwest towards [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and northeast to [[Washington, D.C.]] Other highways serving Charlottesville include [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|U.S. Route 250]] and [[Virginia State Route 20]]. US 29 and US 250 are served locally by bypasses around downtown, with business routes passing directly through downtown.\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Cville bus Station (4904743457).jpg|thumb|right|Bus Transit Center in downtown Charlottesville (2013)]]\nCharlottesville is served by [[Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport]], the [[Charlottesville (Amtrak station)|Charlottesville Amtrak Station]], and a [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus terminal. Direct bus service to [[New York City]] is also provided by the [[Starlight Express (bus)|Starlight Express]]. [[Charlottesville Area Transit]] provides area bus service, augmented by JAUNT, a regional [[paratransit]] van service. [[University Transit Service]] provides mass transit for students and residents in the vicinity of the University of Virginia.\n\n=====Rail=====\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service, provides service to Charlottesville with three routes: The [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] (service between Chicago and New York City via central Virginia and Washington, D.C.), select ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' trains (service between Boston and Roanoke) and the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']] (service between New York City and New Orleans). The ''Cardinal'' operates three times a week, while the ''Crescent'' and ''Northeast Regional'' both run daily in both directions.\n\nCharlottesville was once a major rail hub, served by both the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) and the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]]. The first train service to Charlottesville began in the early 1850s by the Louisa Railroad Company, which became the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] before becoming the C&O. The Southern Railway started service to Charlottesville around the mid-1860s with a north\u2013south route crossing the C&O east-west tracks. The new depot that sprang up at the crossing of the two tracks was called Union Station. In addition to the new rail line, Southern located a major repair shop that produced competition between the two rail companies and bolstered the local economy. The Queen Charlotte Hotel went up on West Main street along with restaurants for the many new railroad workers.\n\nThe former C&O station on East Water Street was turned into offices in the mid-1990s. [[Charlottesville Union Station]], still a functional depot for Amtrak, is located on West Main street between 7th and 9th streets where the tracks of the former C&O Railway (leased by C&O successor [[CSX]] to [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]]) and Southern (now [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]) lines cross. Amtrak and the city of Charlottesville finished refurbishing the station just after 2000, upgrading the depot and adding a full-service restaurant. The Amtrak Crescent travels on Norfolk Southern's dual north\u2013south tracks. The Amtrak Cardinal runs on the Buckingham Branch east-west single track, which follows [[U.S. Route 250]] from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to a point east of Charlottesville near Cismont. The eastbound Cardinal joins the northbound Norfolk Southern line at [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]], on its way to Washington, D.C.\n\nCharlottesville also had an electric streetcar line, the [[Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway]] (C&A), that operated during the early twentieth century. Streetcar lines existed in Charlottesville since the late 1880s under various names until organized as the C&A in 1903. The C&A operated streetcars until 1935, when the line shut down due to rising costs and decreased ridership.\n\nThere are proposals to extend [[Virginia Railway Express]], the [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line connecting [[Northern Virginia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to Charlottesville.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cvillerail.org\n | title= CvilleRail\n | accessdate = February 24, 2008\n}}</ref> Also, the [[Transdominion Express]] steering committee has suggested making Charlottesville a stop on the proposed statewide passenger rail line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdxinfo.org/proposed-route-map/ |title=TransDominion Express Route Map |publisher=The Committee to Advance The TransDominion Express |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Charlottesville, Virginia}}\nSince the city's early formation, it has been home to numerous notable individuals, from historic figures [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], to literary giants [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Faulkner]], to NFL player [[Ralph Horween]]. In the present day, Charlottesville's Albemarle County is or has been the home of movie stars [[Rob Lowe]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Sam Shepard]], novelist [[John Grisham]], the poet [[Rita Dove]], the [[Dave Matthews Band]], and the pop band [[Parachute (band)|Parachute]], as well as multi-billionaires [[John Kluge]] and [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] Between 1968 and 1984, Charlottesville was also the home of [[Anna Anderson]], best known for her false claims to be [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] and lone survivor of the 1918 massacre of [[Nicholas II]]'s royal family. \n\nThe city was also home of the Tibetan lama [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], but he and his family have since moved to California.

A year later, the Charlottesville Factory, founded c. 1820\u201330, was accidentally burnt during General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s 1865 raid through the Shenandoah Valley, although the mayor had surrendered the city to Generals Custer and Sheridan to keep the town from being burned. The factory had been taken over by the Confederacy and used to manufacture woolen clothing for the soldiers.

I-64 heads east to [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and west to [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. US 29 heads southwest towards [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and northeast to [[Washington, D.C.]] Other highways serving Charlottesville include [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|U.S. Route 250]] and [[Virginia State Route 20]]. US 29 and US 250 are served locally by bypasses around downtown, with business routes passing directly through downtown.\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Cville bus Station (4904743457).jpg|thumb|right|Bus Transit Center in downtown Charlottesville (2013)]]\nCharlottesville is served by [[Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport]], the [[Charlottesville (Amtrak station)|Charlottesville Amtrak Station]], and a [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus terminal. Direct bus service to [[New York City]] is also provided by the [[Starlight Express (bus)|Starlight Express]]. [[Charlottesville Area Transit]] provides area bus service, augmented by JAUNT, a regional [[paratransit]] van service. [[University Transit Service]] provides mass transit for students and residents in the vicinity of the University of Virginia.\n\n=====Rail=====\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service, provides service to Charlottesville with three routes: The [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] (service between Chicago and New York City via central Virginia and Washington, D.C.), select ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' trains (service between Boston and Roanoke) and the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']] (service between New York City and New Orleans). The ''Cardinal'' operates three times a week, while the ''Crescent'' and ''Northeast Regional'' both run daily in both directions.\n\nCharlottesville was once a major rail hub, served by both the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) and the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]]. The first train service to Charlottesville began in the early 1850s by the Louisa Railroad Company, which became the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] before becoming the C&O. The Southern Railway started service to Charlottesville around the mid-1860s with a north\u2013south route crossing the C&O east-west tracks. The new depot that sprang up at the crossing of the two tracks was called Union Station. In addition to the new rail line, Southern located a major repair shop that produced competition between the two rail companies and bolstered the local economy. The Queen Charlotte Hotel went up on West Main street along with restaurants for the many new railroad workers.\n\nThe former C&O station on East Water Street was turned into offices in the mid-1990s. [[Charlottesville Union Station]], still a functional depot for Amtrak, is located on West Main street between 7th and 9th streets where the tracks of the former C&O Railway (leased by C&O successor [[CSX]] to [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]]) and Southern (now [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]) lines cross. Amtrak and the city of Charlottesville finished refurbishing the station just after 2000, upgrading the depot and adding a full-service restaurant. The Amtrak Crescent travels on Norfolk Southern's dual north\u2013south tracks. The Amtrak Cardinal runs on the Buckingham Branch east-west single track, which follows [[U.S. Route 250]] from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to a point east of Charlottesville near Cismont. The eastbound Cardinal joins the northbound Norfolk Southern line at [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]], on its way to Washington, D.C.\n\nCharlottesville also had an electric streetcar line, the [[Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway]] (C&A), that operated during the early twentieth century. Streetcar lines existed in Charlottesville since the late 1880s under various names until organized as the C&A in 1903. The C&A operated streetcars until 1935, when the line shut down due to rising costs and decreased ridership.\n\nThere are proposals to extend [[Virginia Railway Express]], the [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line connecting [[Northern Virginia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to Charlottesville.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cvillerail.org\n | title= CvilleRail\n | accessdate = February 24, 2008\n}}</ref> Also, the [[Transdominion Express]] steering committee has suggested making Charlottesville a stop on the proposed statewide passenger rail line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdxinfo.org/proposed-route-map/ |title=TransDominion Express Route Map |publisher=The Committee to Advance The TransDominion Express |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Charlottesville, Virginia}}\nSince the city's early formation, it has been home to numerous notable individuals, from historic figures [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], to literary giants [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Faulkner]], to NFL player [[Ralph Horween]]. In the present day, Charlottesville's Albemarle County is or has been the home of movie stars [[Rob Lowe]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Sam Shepard]], novelist [[John Grisham]], the poet [[Rita Dove]], the [[Dave Matthews Band]], and the pop band [[Parachute (band)|Parachute]], as well as multi-billionaires [[John Kluge]] and [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] Between 1968 and 1984, Charlottesville was also the home of [[Anna Anderson]], best known for her false claims to be [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] and lone survivor of the 1918 massacre of [[Nicholas II]]'s royal family. \n\nThe city was also home of the Tibetan lama [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], but he and his family have since moved to California.
