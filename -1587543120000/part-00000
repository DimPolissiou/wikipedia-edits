In 1955, CPR renamed its transcontinental route between [[Montreal]]/Toronto and Vancouver the ''Canadian'', with new streamlined trains. Via Rail took over in 1978, and in 1990 reduced the ''Canadian'' to Toronto\u2013Vancouver service primarily along [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] tracks. All service on the ''Canadian'' was suspended  due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|2020 Coronavirus Pandemic]].\n\n== History ==\nIn the years following [[World War II]], passenger trains on the CPR consisted of a mixture of prewar heavyweight and pre- and post-war lightweight cars, even on its [[flagship]] transcontinental ''[[The Dominion (passenger train)|The Dominion]]'' and its eastern extension, ''[[The Atlantic Limited]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  While these cars were serviceable, [[United States|American]] trains of the early 1950s, such as the ''[[California Zephyr]]'', had already adopted [[Streamliner cars (rail)|streamlined]] all-[[stainless steel]] consists featuring [[dome car|domed]] [[observation car]]s.  Following an evaluation in 1949 of the dome cars featured on the [[General Motors Diesel|General Motors]] / [[Pullman Company|Pullman Standard]] demonstrator ''[[Train of Tomorrow]]'', CPR management, including then Vice President [[Norris Roy \"Buck\" Crump|Norris Crump]], resolved to upgrade its rolling stock.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\">{{cite journal|date=November\u2013December 2004|title=The 50th Anniversary of the CPR Stainless Steel Passenger Fleet|url=http://www.exporail.org/can_rail/Canadian%20Rail_no503_2004.pdf|journal=Canadian Rail|issue=503|pages=211\u2013223}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, CPR placed an order for 155 stainless steel cars with the [[Budd Company]] of [[Philadelphia]] that included 18 rear-end dome cars ([[Park series|''Park'' series]]), 18 ''[[Skyline series|Skyline]]'' mid-train dome cars, 30 [[Coach (rail)|coach]]es, 18 [[dining car]]s and 71 [[sleeping car]]s (''[[Manor series|Manor]]'' and ''[[Ch\u00e2teau series|Ch\u00e2teau]]'' series). A subsequent order for 18 baggage-crew dormitory cars brought the final to total to 173 cars, sufficient for establishing an entirely new transcontinental service and partially re-equipping ''The Dominion''.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\" />  The [[interior design]] of these new cars was contracted to the Philadelphia [[architecture|architectural]] firm Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson (a company known for its industrial designs on other prominent passenger trains such as the ''[[Pioneer Zephyr]]''), and the resulting furnishings and pastel-shaded colour schemes were widely acclaimed.\n\nAfter deciding to name the ''Park'' series dome cars after famous Canadian parks, leading Canadian [[artist]]s, including members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], were commissioned to paint suitable murals for these cars.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\" />  When the decision was made to add budget sleeping cars, the Budd order was supplemented by 22 existing heavyweight sleepers that CPR refurbished in its own Angus Shops, each fitted out with Budd-style stainless steel cladding.  To complement the new rolling stock, the CPR ordered General Motors Diesel [[EMD FP9|FP9]] [[locomotives]] to supplement an existing fleet of [[EMD FP7|FP7]]s.  Although these [[EMD F-unit|F-units]] remained the preferred power for the train, it would occasionally pulled by a variety of motive power, including [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] [[MLW FPA-2|FPA-2s]].[[File:CP Rail The Canadian.jpg|thumb|The ''Canadian'' leaving Toronto in 1970.|alt=|left]]\n\n=== Service under CPR ===\nCPR christened its new flagship train ''The Canadian'' and service began on April 24, 1955. Running time between Montreal and Vancouver was reduced from about 85 to 71 hours, so that passengers spent only three, rather than four, nights en route. Although CPR competitor Canadian National Railways began its own new transcontinental service, the ''[[Super Continental]]'', on the same day, CPR was able to boast honestly that ''The Canadian'' was \"The first and only all-stainless steel 'dome' stream-liner in Canada\" \u2014 it was not until 1964 that the CNR acquired dome cars from the [[Milwaukee Road]].\n\nThe train operated with Montreal and Toronto sections which ran combined west of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]. The Montreal section (also serving [[Ottawa]]) was known as train 1 westbound and train 2 eastbound, while the Toronto section was known as train 11 westbound and train 12 eastbound.  Matching its streamlined appearance, ''The Canadian''{{'}}s 71-hour westbound schedule was 16 hours faster than that of ''The Dominion''.\n\nAlthough initially successful, passenger train ridership began to decline in Canada during the 1960s.  Facing competition from airlines and increased automobile usage following construction of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the CPR cancelled ''The Dominion'' in 1966, and petitioned the [[Government of Canada|government]] to discontinue ''The Canadian'' in 1970.  Although this petition was denied, CPR during the 1970s attempted to remove itself from the passenger service market. ''The Canadian'' was operated at reduced levels, with the government subsidizing 80 percent of its losses.[[File:VIA6506calg1982.jpg|thumb|''The Canadian'' in [[Calgary]], 1982|alt=|left]]\n\n===Service under Via Rail===\nVia Rail, a federal [[crown corporation]], formally assumed responsibility for CPR's passenger services on October 29, 1978, although the Via identity was not assumed by the trains themselves until the following summer. Following the takeover by Via, the ''Canadian'' became the company's premier transcontinental train, and initially operated over its old CPR route.  It was supplemented by the former CN ''Super Continental'', which operated over the parallel, but more northerly, CN route. The ''Canadian'' continued to be operated in two sections east of Sudbury and provided daily service west to Vancouver and east to Toronto and Montreal.[[File:TheCanadian RouteMap.png|thumb|The old (red) and new (blue) routes of ''The Canadian.''|alt=|left]]\n\nThe ''Super Continental'' was discontinued in 1981 due to sharp [[Canadian federal budget|budget]] cuts. Since then, the ''Canadian'' has Via Rail's only true transcontinental train. While the ''Super Continental'' was brought back in 1985 amid popular demand, it only ran as far east as Winnipeg.\n\nIn the aftermath of another round of deep budget cuts made to Via Rail on January 15, 1990, Via again discontinued the ''Super Continental,'' this time permanently. The ''Canadian'' was moved from CPR trackage to the CN route plied by the ''Super Continental'' for its first quarter-century, dropping the Montreal section. The new longer route bypassed [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and [[Calgary]] in favour of [[Saskatoon]] and [[Edmonton]]. This maintained transcontinental service and allowed Via to operate its government-mandated service to small communities along the line. At the same time, the absence of transportation alternatives along the CPR route allowed entrepreneur Peter Armstrong to develop the [[Rocky Mountaineer]] excursion service.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Johnston|first=Bob|date=November 2018|title=Reflecting on Via Rail Canada at 40|magazine=TRAINS|location=Waukesha, WI|publisher=Kalmbach|volume=78|issue=11|pages=27\u20138|doi=|pmid=|quote=One factor driving the decision to move the ''Canadian'' over to the ''Super Continental''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s route was lobbying by Vancouver entrepreneur Peter Armstrong to privatize Via\u2019s summer excursions to Banff, Alta., introduced in 1988. This came with the understanding his fledgling operation would get route exclusivity and some initial financial assistance from Via to ensure the venture\u2019s success. After a few shaky early years, Armstrong invested heavily in speciality dome cars to make Rocky Mountaineer a financial and creative success in a way the publicly funded operator never could.|ref=harv|id={{ProQuest|2110411952}}}}</ref>  Moreover, while pre-1990 schedules had daily service on both the CP and CN routes, service following the 1990 cuts was a mere three days per week, reduced further to two times a week in the offseason.\n\nIn 2007 the schedule was lengthened so that the train now takes four nights, rather than three, to travel between Toronto and Vancouver.  The four-night schedule is almost identical (in terms of travel time) with that of the 1940s, despite [[Dieselisation|substantial technological change]] since then.\n\nIn 2013, the train was honoured by being featured on the back of the new polymer [[Canadian ten-dollar note|$10 Canadian bill]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/zoom-5-10-dollar-bills/ | title=Zoom : Canada's new polymer $5 and $10 bills | author=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2013-04-30 |work=CBC News| author-link=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, Via Rail continues to operate the ''Canadian'' using the rebuilt ex-CPR Budd passenger equipment.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Johnston|2018|}}.</ref>\n\nThe schedule was lengthened again effective July 26, 2018 to four days and four nights in each direction due to continuing schedule reliability problems on the host railway.<ref>https://media.viarail.ca/en/press-releases/2018/22-june-2018-via-rail-modifies-schedule-canadian</ref>\nThe ''Canadian'' currently takes 94 hours 15 minutes westbound<ref>https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/winter2018/40-41_Toronto-Winnipeg-Jasper-Vancouver.pdf</ref> vs. 95 hours 29 minutes eastbound.<ref>https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/winter2018/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf</ref> This is 13h50m vs. 12h19m slower than the ''Continental''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 80h25m vs. 83h10m<ref>https://timetableworld.com/image_viewer.php?id=3&section_id=152</ref> and 13h5m vs. 12h24m slower than the ''Dominion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 81h10m vs. 83h5m<ref>https://timetableworld.com/image_viewer.php?id=3&section_id=155</ref> schedules from 1952.\n\nService on the Canadian (along with most of VIA's other services) was suspended due to [[protest]] blockade at several points on the Canadian National Railway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/via-rail-cancels-trains-across-canada-cn-shuts-down-eastern-canada-network-amid-pipeline-protests-1.4811036|title=VIA Rail cancels trains across Canada, CN shuts down Eastern Canada network amid pipeline protests|last=Slaughter|first=Graham|date=2020-02-13|website=CTVNews|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/via-rail-suspends-the-canadian-and-ocean-routes-because-of-covid-19-301023347.html|title=VIA Rail suspends the Canadian and Ocean routes because of COVID-19|last=Inc|first=VIA Rail Canada|website=prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> After the blockades were lifted, within a month, the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|2020 Coronavirus Pandemic]] resulted in the suspension of nearly all VIA Rail services, including all trains on the ''Canadian.''\n\n===Current operations===\nOn April March 21, 2020, the ''Canadian'' and most other VIA Rail services were suspended due to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelweek.ca/news/via-rail-announces-service-changes-in-response-to-covid-19/|title=VIA Rail announces service changes in response to COVID-19 - Travelweek|last=Group|first=Travelweek|date=2020-03-23|website=travelweek.ca/|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> This suspension will continue until at least June 1, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/covid-19-important-updates-via-rail-extends-the-suspension-of-the-ocean-816048573.html|title=COVID-19 Important Updates - VIA Rail Extends the Suspension of the Ocean|last=Inc|first=VIA Rail Canada|website=newswire.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> When operating on the normal schedule, the ''Canadian'' operates twice per week, departing Toronto on Wednesdays and Sundays and Vancouver on Mondays and Fridays.

It uses the [[BNSF]] tracks through suburban communities including [[Burnaby]], to [[New Westminster]]. After the train crosses the [[New Westminster Bridge]], the ''Canadian'' leaves BNSF for CN tracks east.  From New Westminster to [[Gifford, British Columbia]], the route passes railroad yards and industry.\n\n==== Fraser and Thompson River Canyons ====\nAt Gifford, the train diverts from the CN mainline and crosses the [[Fraser River]] to [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]. CN and CPR utilize [[directional running]] through the [[Fraser River Canyon|Fraser]] and [[Thompson River Canyon|Thompson River]] canyons; eastbound trains use the CPR lines and westbounds the CN tracks. Thus, for the section through the two canyons, the ''Canadian'' runs on its original CPR route. From Mission to [[Cisco, British Columbia|Cisco]], the CPR runs west (north) of the river; afterwards, it runs east (south). Near [[Basque, British Columbia|Basque]], the eastbound ''Canadian'' transfers onto the CN main.\n\nWestbound, the ''Canadian'' stays on the CN tracks all the way into Vancouver. The CN route passes through Painted Canyon, and features CN's {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} steel-arched bridge over the Fraser River and the CPR mainline at Cisco. The tracks in Painted Canyon are only approximately {{convert|200|ft}} above the Thompson River. After Cisco, the CN mainline stays of the east/south side of the Fraser River all the way to the [[New Westminster Bridge]], where the two routes merge.\n\nOn their regular schedules, both east and westbound ''Canadian''s travel through the Fraser and Thompson river canyons at night.\n\n==== Basque-Kamloops ====\nTraveling eastbound from Basque, the CN line crosses back across the [[Thompson River]].  Aside from a few brief deviations across the river, the line stays on the north/west side into just outside Kamloops.  Arriving in Kamloops, the train halts at [[Kamloops station]].\n\n=== Kamloops\u2013Jasper ===\n[[File:North Thompson River.jpg|thumb|right|CN's crossing of the [[Thompson River|North Thompson River]].]]\n[[File:Canadian following North Thompson River in BC.jpg|thumb|right|The North Thompson River and bridge from the train.]]'''North Thompson River Canyon'''\n\nFor six hours after departing Kamloops, the tracks run north, following the [[Thompson River|North Thompson River]] for much of the way and indeed crossing it several times.<ref name=\"eastbound-schedule\">{{cite web |url=http://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/october2016/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf |title=The Canadian, Eastbound Schedule |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402231001/http://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/october2016/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2017 }}</ref>{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}}  The scenery changes gradually from the dry, rolling plateau \u2013 though miles of irrigation soften the starkness \u2013 to the lusher, evergreen forests. Narrow valleys bordered by mountains on both sides feature farmlands, pastures, forests, logging camps, and small communities.  The latter often have flag stops \u2014 for example, [[Clearwater, British Columbia|Clearwater]] and [[Blue River, British Columbia|Blue River]].  Near Clearwater, the train crosses the [[Clearwater River (British Columbia)|Clearwater River]]. The [[Monashee Mountains]] lie to the east for much of the way to Valemount.\n\nSome of the most dramatic scenery along the route occurs in this area as the train clings precariously to the mountainsides \u2013 particularly [[Groundhog Mountain]] and [[Mount Cheadle]].  Although [[railway slide fence]]s protect the route, the train creeps along at a cautious pace \u2013 usually {{convert|26|\u2013|30|mph}}.\n\nOn the downslope side of the train lies the North Thompson River; in the distance are often-snow-covered mountains.  The icefields of the [[Albreda Glacier]] should be visible for several miles.  At [[Little Hells Gate (Port d'Enfer)]], lies above treacherous rapids similar to [[Hells Gate (British Columbia)|Hells Gate]] farther south on the Fraser.  One of the prettiest sights in this area is of [[Pyramid Falls]], which cascades {{convert|300|ft}} down the side of Mount Cheadle. The train slows down enough for passengers to get close-up looks and maybe [[Photo op|get a nice picture or two]].\n\nSouth of [[Valemount]], the train passes a memorial to the [[Canoe River train crash|Canoe River crash]].  The train then crosses [[Canoe River (British Columbia)|the river]] over a {{convert|240|ft|adj=on}} bridge and arrives at another flag stop ([[Valemount station]]).\n\n==== Valemount\u2013Redpass ====\nNorth of Valemount, eastbound and westbound trains routes again diverge.  Eastbound trains use CN's Albreda Subdivision, which continues to climb until Milepost 65.6, a curve near [[Jackman, British Columbia|Jackman]].  The line then runs eastward at constant elevation through [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]], with views of [[Mount Robson]].  The line passes through a {{convert|1670|ft|adj=on}} tunnel, where a 1905 avalanche buried railroad workers,{{Dubious |reason=Construction of this line started in 1910|date=March 2019}} and then descends to [[Redpass, British Columbia|Redpass Junction]], where it joins with CN's Robson Subdivision.  The latter is used by westbound trains; it is lower in elevation and has more favourable grades than the Albreda Subdivision.\n\n==== Redpass-Yellowhead Pass ====\n\nRedpass Junction is near the western shore of [[Moose Lake (British Columbia)|Moose Lake]].  The lake is another scenic highlight, as the train follows along the north shore of the lake for several miles, and there are a couple of splashing waterfalls cascading down from the\u012b mountains into the lake.  The south shore of the lake is the [[Selwyn Range (British Columbia)|Selwyn Range]], which the train has essentially detoured around.  The [[Yellowhead Highway]] (Highway #16) parallels the CN tracks to the north.[[File:Jasper lake with mountains from train.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jasper Lake (Alberta)|Jasper Lake]] with mountains in the distance as seen from the ''Canadian'' passenger train.]]\n\nAfter Moose Lake, the train travels through a narrow valley nestled between the mountains, crosses the [[Moose River (British Columbia)|Moose]] and [[Fraser River|Fraser]] rivers and continues following the Fraser. Soon the train comes to the next major scenic highlight of the trip: [[Yellowhead Lake]].  Yellowhead Mountain continues to hover overhead to the north while Mounts [[Mount Rockingham|Rockingham]] ({{Cvt|7797|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Mount Fitzwilliam|Fitzwilliam]] ({{Cvt|9549|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakfinder.com/peakfinder.asp?PeakName=Mount+Fitzwilliam|title=Mount Fitzwilliam|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702045447/http://www.peakfinder.com/peakfinder.asp?PeakName=Mount+Fitzwilliam|archive-date=2 July 2003|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) can be seen to the south across the lake. The train finally crosses the [[Continental Divide]] at [[Yellowhead Pass]], which at {{Cvt|3718|ft|m}} is the lowest crossing of the divide in North America.\n\nYellowhead Pass marks the boundaries between [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones, the [[Watersheds of North America|Pacific and Arctic watersheds]], and [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. Once again the train hugs mountainsides among the [[Victoria Cross Range]] (to the north) above the [[Miette River]] and creeps through tunnels and past protective slide detector fences. Whistler Mountain is in view as the train descends, rounds a curve and pulls into the [[Jasper railway station|Jasper train station]].\n\n===At Jasper===\n{{main|Jasper railway station}}\nThe ''Canadian'', in both directions, is scheduled to be at Jasper station for an hour and a half for servicing.  [[Mount Edith Cavell]] ({{cvt|11,033|ft|disp=sqbr}}) is visible toward the south. [[Pyramid Mountain (Alberta)|Pyramid Mountain]] ({{cvt|9,075|ft|disp=sqbr}}) and the [[Victoria Cross Ranges]] are to the northwest.  [[The Whistlers]], to the southwest, can be summited via the [[Jasper Skytram]].\n\nPassengers are encouraged to get off the train and wander around downtown Jasper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jasper.travel/|title=Jasper, Alberta, Canada: Official Site of Tourism Jasper, AB|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>  In addition to shops and restaurants, downtown Jasper contains [[Jasper Park Information Centre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasper-alberta.com/|title=Jasper, AB - Official Website {{!}} Official Website|website=jasper-alberta.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>  The centre provides maps and other information about the park and surrounding [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks|UNESCO World Heritage]] site through which the train travels.\n\nThe [[Jasper railway station|station]] itself has a few attractions: the Jasper Raven Totem Pole<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaspernationalpark.com/history/jaspers-historic-raven-totem-pole.html|title=Jasper National Park History - Jasper's Historic Raven Totem Pole|author=Aldwin Galapon, JA Media Solutions, April 2009, www.jamediasolutions.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> and a vintage CN [[4-8-2]] steam locomotive are on display, and inside the station is a caf\u00e9 barista that also sells railroad memorabilia and other gifts.

The railroad comes in from the northwest and rounds a curve into the station. At the station, the train is actually facing northeast. Upon leaving the station, the train continues in a more northeasterly direction rather than due east. Also the train has descended into Jasper from Yellowhead Pass and now climbs a grade shortly after leaving the Jasper railyards. The train is once again hugging mountainsides overlooking the Athabasca [[Athabasca Valley|Valley]] and [[Athabasca River|River]] and surrounding mountains. There is usually a flock of [[bighorn sheep]] grazing on the bluffs above the train to the north. During the winter, they can often be seen licking salt off the parallel [[Yellowhead Highway]].  Other Canadian wildlife that may be seen from the train{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} include [[bear]], [[deer]], [[elk]], [[mountain goat]], and various species of Canadian birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westerncanadatravel.com/canadian.rockies.wildlife.htm|title=Wildlife of the Canadian Rockies|last=Hempstead|first=Andrew|date=2006|website=Travel to Canada: Travel to the Canadian Rockies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816005208/http://www.westerncanadatravel.com/canadian.rockies.wildlife.htm|archive-date=16 August 2012|url-status=live|accessdate=13 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo the north/northwest, passengers will see the peaks of the Victoria Cross Range\u2014so named because six of the peaks are named after Canadian recipients of the [[Victoria Cross]].  [[Mount McKean]] ({{convert|2743|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite peakfinder|id=884|name=Mount McKean|access-date=13 September 2019}}</ref>) and [[Mount Zengel]] ({{convert|2630|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite peakfinder|id=1562|name=Mount Zengel|accessdate=13 September 2019}}</ref>) are two such mountains that can be seen from the train.

The Yellowhead Highway rides along the south shore of the lake. The lake is a shallow, wide section of the Athabasca River. This has been the site of many CN publicity photographs\u2014including of the ''Super Continental''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railpictures.ca/upload/via-train-3-the-westbound-super-continental-on-a-rainy-day-running-along-jasper-lake|title=Railpictures.ca - Peter Gloor Photo: Via train 3, the westbound Super Continental, on a rainy day running along Jasper Lake. {{!}} Railpictures.ca \u2013 Canadian Railway Photography \u2013 photographie ferroviaire Canadienne.|website=railpictures.ca|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} <!-- Citation is an WP:OR shot of Via's Super Continental at Jasper Lake, not a CN publicity photo of same -->\u2014through the years, and it is still popular with photographers, railfans, the present-day ''Canadian'', its advertisers and its passengers.

They are the only sand dunes ecosystem in the Canadian Rockies. Parts of the mainline have been built on causeways away from the shore, which have created several mini lakes. This adds to the effect of being out on the water, creating additional views of the lake, its waters and the forests and mountains surrounding it. The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, many of which can be seen the train from various places along the lake. They include:\n\nFrom southeast to southwest:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peakfinder.com/|title=Peakfinder|website=peakfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\n*[[Miette Range]].  Most prominent peaks include [[Utopia Mountain]] ({{Cvt|2602|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Roche Miette]] ({{Cvt|7600|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}).\n*[[Jacques Range]]. Prominent peaks: [[Cinquefoil Mountain]] ({{convert|2259|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}),  [[Roche Jacques]] ({{convert|2603|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}), and [[Mount Merlin]] ({{convert|2711|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}).\n*[[Colin Range]]: Peaks include [[Mount Colin]] ({{convert|2687|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}) and [[Roche Bonhomme]] ({{convert|2495|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref name=\"peakfinder.com\" />)\n\nNorthwest to northeast:\n* [[Victoria Cross Ranges]]\n* [[De Smet Range]]. Prominent peaks include: [[Roche de Smet]], ({{convert|2539|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Mount Greenock]] ({{convert|2065|m|ft|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}).\n* [[Bosche Range]]: [[Mount Aeolus (Alberta)|Mount Aeolus]] ({{convert|2643|m|ft|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}}) and [[Roche \u00e0 Bosche]] ({{convert|2123|m|ft|disp=sqbr|abbr=on}})\n\nThe train crosses [[Stoney River]], glides through a {{convert|700|ft|adj=on}} horseshoe tunnel underneath [[Disaster Point]], and begins riding along the shores of [[Br\u00fbl\u00e9 Lake (Alberta)|Br\u00fbl\u00e9 Lake]].  Along the way, it passes [[Black Cat Mountain]] ({{convert|1800|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=black+cat+mountain|title=Black Cat Mountain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214312/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=black+cat+mountain|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) and [[Mount Solomon]] ({{convert|1585|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=mount+solomon|title=Mount Solomon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214251/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=mount+solomon|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>). The Yellowhead Highway is on the other side of the lake. [[Folding Mountain]] ({{convert|2844|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=folding+mountain|title=Folding Mountain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214318/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=folding+mountain|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) should be visible as the train crosses the Athabasca River. The river is now on the north side of the tracks.\n\n==== Entrance ====\nEntrance is the official easternmost point of the Canadian Rockies (at least on the CN), but the [[Miette Range]] usually is still visible for many miles as the train heads out across the prairies.  The surrounding landscapes are still heavily forested and the riverbanks a bit dramatic, but the land slowly opens up to ever broader valleys, plains,  and farmlands.  About three miles west of Hinton, the train crosses an impressive trestle over Prairie Creek with the Athabasca still in sight. The train crosses a curved trestle over Sundance Creek just West of [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]]; then crosses the McLoed River on a {{convert|1066|ft|adj=on}} bridge and Wolf Creek on a {{convert|652|ft|adj=on}} bridge. The train rides along the shores of three lakes: to the north the Octopus Lake; to the south, Wabamun and Chip. Westbound, train passengers should be able to start seeing mountains (still way off in the distance) just after crossing the Sundance Creek trestle.\n\nThe train finally reaches West Junction [[Wye (rail)|wye]], and backs into [[Edmonton railway station (Via Rail)|Edmonton Via Rail station]].  (Westbound trains also back into the station.)  The train is scheduled to dwell at the station for an hour for a crew change and other servicing. The Panorama car travels only between Vancouver and Edmonton. Here, the car is taken off (eastbound) or put on (westbound). Edmonton station is a suburban development across the street from the former airport [[Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport|Blatchford Field]]; the skyline of downtown [[Edmonton]] is off in the distance.\n\n=== Edmonton to Saskatoon ===\nThe train (in both east and westbound) backs into the station upon arrival with the train facing north while standing at the station. Departing out of [[Edmonton station (Via Rail)|Edmonton station]], the train heads east past the CN Walker Yard (city skyline is visible to the south) and cuts across the Canadian prairies for nearly {{convert|470|km}}, paralleling [[Alberta Highway 14]]. The train stops in the rural communities of [[Viking, Alberta|Viking]] and [[Wainwright, Alberta]], before turning south to follow Alberta Highway 610.  The train then crosses the Alberta\u2013Saskatchewan border and stops in [[Unity, Saskatchewan]], before passing over the Killsquaw Lakes en route to [[Biggar station|Biggar]]. Now paralleling [[Saskatchewan Highway 14]], the train enters [[Saskatoon]] from the west, stopping at the modern [[Saskatoon station]] south of downtown on the site of the CN Chappell Yard via a short spur line.\n\n=== Saskatoon to Winnipeg ===\nAfter re-joining the CN main line, the train follows [[Saskatchewan Highway 11]] out of the urban core of Saskatoon before once again paralleling the Yellowhead Highway. Now heading southeast, it begins to follow [[Saskatchewan Highway 2]] into [[Watrous, Saskatchewan|Watrous]], where the tracks branch off once more. Staying on the CN main line, the train heads east towards [[Melville, Saskatchewan|Melville]], paralleling [[Saskatchewan Highway 15|Hwy. 15]], and heads southeast towards the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. After entering Manitoba, the train stops in [[Rivers, Manitoba|Rivers]], and heads east to [[Portage la Prairie]], now following the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. It then continues east towards Winnipeg, where the tracks turn north, following the [[Assiniboine River]], and enter the historic [[Winnipeg Union Station]]. Here, passengers can transfer to the Winnipeg-Churchill train. Northeast of Union Station, the train crosses over the [[Red River of the North|Red River Of The North]], and heads east through CN's [[Transcona Yards]]. This section has a distance of nearly 714 kilometers (443 miles).\n\n[[Image:Thecanadian with canoe.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man loading a canoe onto a baggage car, while a family watches|The ''Canadian'' picking up a canoeist in central Ontario]]\n\n=== Winnipeg to Toronto ===\nWith its journey through the prairies almost over, the train heads out of the yards and continues east, following Manitoba Provincial Trunk Hwy. 15, towards the rural community of [[Elma, Manitoba|Elma]], then turning east-northeast towards [[Brereton Lake railway station|Brereton Lake]], [[Ophir]] and [[Winnitoba railway station|Winnitoba]], and crosses the Manitoba-Ontario border after traversing [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]].  Now in Ontario, the train travels through the rugged [[Canadian Shield]], stopping at [[Rice Lake, Ontario|Rice Lake]] and [[Copelands Landing]] en route to [[Malachi, Ontario|Malachi]].  After Malachi, the train loops around and heads through [[Ottermere, Ontario|Ottermere]], [[Minaki railway station|Minaki]], [[Redditt railway station|Redditt]], [[Farlane railway station|Farlane]], [[Canyon station (Via Rail)|Canyon]] and [[Red Lake Road railway station|Red Lake Road]], where it loops around once more and stops at [[Richan]] and [[Millidge, Ontario|Millidge]], and continues into the town of [[Sioux Lookout]].  Afterwards it heads through [[Savant Lake railway station|Savant Lake]], [[Flindt Landing railway station|Flindt Landing]], [[Allanwater Bridge railway station|Allanwater Bridge]], [[Collins railway station|Collins]], [[Armstrong railway station|Armstrong]], [[Mud River railway station|Mud River]], [[Ferland railway station|Ferland]], [[Auden railway station|Auden]], [[Nakina railway station|Nakina]], [[Longlac railway station|Longlac]], [[Caramat railway station|Caramat]], and [[Hillsport railway station|Hillsport]] en route to [[Hornepayne, Ontario|Hornepayne]].  After Hornepayne, it stops at [[Oba, Ontario|Oba]], where passengers could connect with the [[Algoma Central Railway]]'s [[Agawa Canyon]] tour train until the latter's demise.  Stops are made at [[Elsas railway station|Elsas]], [[Foleyet railway station|Foleyet]], [[Gogama railway station|Gogama]], [[Westree railway station|Westree]], [[Ruel railway station|Ruel]], [[Felix railway station|Felix]], [[McKee's Camp railway station|McKee's Camp]], and [[Laforest railway station|Laforest]] before the train enters [[Capreol, Ontario|Capreol]].  At [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], the train stops at [[Sudbury Junction station|Sudbury Junction]], where passengers can transfer via taxi to the Sudbury-[[White River, Ontario|White River]] service.  The many flag stops between Winnipeg and Sudbury are usually only accessible by rail transport, and between Winnipeg and Capreol passengers may reserve to be dropped off or picked up at any location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stops in between two stations |url=https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/stops-between-two-explore-our-destinations/stations |website=Via Rail Canada |publisher=Via Rail Canada |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Parry Sound ====\nThe train then turns south towards [[Parry Sound, Ontario]] and [[Washago, Ontario]].  From the junction of [[Wanup, Ontario|Wanup]] to [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]], directional running with both CN and CP Railways is again put into place. This time however, eastbound (southbound) trains utilize the CN Bala Subdivision, whilst westbound (northbound) trains use the CP Parry Sound Subdivision.  Thus the latter follows its original CPR route here, traversing the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]]. Through Parry Sound, all trains make use of [[Parry Sound railway station|both CNR and CPR stations]] depending on the direction of travels.  At [[Bala, Ontario|Bala]], both CN's Bala Subdivision and the adjacent CPR line diverges for the final time.\n\n==== Bala to Toronto ====\nFrom Bala, the trains continue along the CN line for approximately {{Cvt|40|km|mi}} to [[Washago, Ontario|Washago]], its final stop before the Toronto terminus. A disused spur to [[Casino Rama]] is located due south, while the Bala Sub parallels the shore of [[Lake Simcoe]] as far as [[Port Bolster, Ontario|Port Bolster]] before heading southwest into [[York Region, Ontario|York Region]].  South of [[Gormley, Ontario|Gormley]], the route is shared with [[GO Transit]]'s [[Richmond Hill line]] commuter services, although the latter does not share stations with the ''Canadian''.  The ''Canadian'' passes through [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] and western [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] into the city of [[Toronto]] proper, with a scenic route paralleling the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] for the final 10&nbsp;km.\n\n=== Toronto Terminal ===\nTrains returning to Vancouver would leave Union Station either from the East as it came in from (if turned around prior), or from the West. In the latter case, the train would then proceed North along the [[CN Newmarket Subdivision|Newmarket Subdivision]], shared by GO Transit's [[Barrie line]]. This subdivision is a portion of a former route for the transcontinental line; however, the train only continues as far as Snyder Diamond in [[Vaughan]]. There it would then proceed Eastbound along the [[CN York Subdivision|York Subdivision]] towards [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]] to meet up with the [[CN Bala Subdivision|Bala Subdivision]] at Doncaster Diamond and from there continue Northwest leaving the Greater Toronto Area towards Washago and eventually Vancouver.\n\n==Ridership, subsidies, and fares==\nIn 2014, the train served 93,810 passengers receiving a government subsidy of $591 per entrained passenger or $0.50 per passenger mile.<ref>Via Rail 2014 Annual Report</ref>   Because the ''Canadian'' is used primarily by tourists, these subsidies have been the source of significant criticism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/romanticism-shields-outrageous-via-rail-subsidies-ex-tory-minister/article4102147/|title=Romanticism shields 'outrageous' Via Rail subsidies: ex-Tory minister|last=|first=|date=|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nMost fares on the Canadian between major cities exceed the cost of discounted pre-purchase scheduled air travel by a fair margin, even in Economy Class.

(Toronto)|Union Station]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, and [[Pacific Central Station]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.\n\nBefore 1955 the ''Canadian'' was a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) train between Toronto and [[Chicago]]. In 1955, CPR renamed its transcontinental route between [[Montreal]]/Toronto and Vancouver the ''Canadian'', with new streamlined trains. Via Rail took over in 1978, and in 1990 reduced the ''Canadian'' to Toronto\u2013Vancouver service primarily along [[Canadian National Railway|Canadian National]] tracks. All service on the ''Canadian'' was suspended  due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|2020 Coronavirus Pandemic]].\n\n== History ==\nIn the years following [[World War II]], passenger trains on the CPR consisted of a mixture of prewar heavyweight and pre- and post-war lightweight cars, even on its [[flagship]] transcontinental ''[[The Dominion (passenger train)|The Dominion]]'' and its eastern extension, ''[[The Atlantic Limited]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  While these cars were serviceable, [[United States|American]] trains of the early 1950s, such as the ''[[California Zephyr]]'', had already adopted [[Streamliner cars (rail)|streamlined]] all-[[stainless steel]] consists featuring [[dome car|domed]] [[observation car]]s.  Following an evaluation in 1949 of the dome cars featured on the [[General Motors Diesel|General Motors]] / [[Pullman Company|Pullman Standard]] demonstrator ''[[Train of Tomorrow]]'', CPR management, including then Vice President [[Norris Roy \"Buck\" Crump|Norris Crump]], resolved to upgrade its rolling stock.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\">{{cite journal|date=November\u2013December 2004|title=The 50th Anniversary of the CPR Stainless Steel Passenger Fleet|url=http://www.exporail.org/can_rail/Canadian%20Rail_no503_2004.pdf|journal=Canadian Rail|issue=503|pages=211\u2013223}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, CPR placed an order for 155 stainless steel cars with the [[Budd Company]] of [[Philadelphia]] that included 18 rear-end dome cars ([[Park series|''Park'' series]]), 18 ''[[Skyline series|Skyline]]'' mid-train dome cars, 30 [[Coach (rail)|coach]]es, 18 [[dining car]]s and 71 [[sleeping car]]s (''[[Manor series|Manor]]'' and ''[[Ch\u00e2teau series|Ch\u00e2teau]]'' series). A subsequent order for 18 baggage-crew dormitory cars brought the final to total to 173 cars, sufficient for establishing an entirely new transcontinental service and partially re-equipping ''The Dominion''.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\" />  The [[interior design]] of these new cars was contracted to the Philadelphia [[architecture|architectural]] firm Harbeson, Hough, Livingston & Larson (a company known for its industrial designs on other prominent passenger trains such as the ''[[Pioneer Zephyr]]''), and the resulting furnishings and pastel-shaded colour schemes were widely acclaimed.\n\nAfter deciding to name the ''Park'' series dome cars after famous Canadian parks, leading Canadian [[artist]]s, including members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], were commissioned to paint suitable murals for these cars.<ref name=\"CanadianRailHistSoc\" />  When the decision was made to add budget sleeping cars, the Budd order was supplemented by 22 existing heavyweight sleepers that CPR refurbished in its own Angus Shops, each fitted out with Budd-style stainless steel cladding.  To complement the new rolling stock, the CPR ordered General Motors Diesel [[EMD FP9|FP9]] [[locomotives]] to supplement an existing fleet of [[EMD FP7|FP7]]s.  Although these [[EMD F-unit|F-units]] remained the preferred power for the train, it would occasionally pulled by a variety of motive power, including [[Montreal Locomotive Works]] [[MLW FPA-2|FPA-2s]].[[File:CP Rail The Canadian.jpg|thumb|The ''Canadian'' leaving Toronto in 1970.|alt=|left]]\n\n=== Service under CPR ===\nCPR christened its new flagship train ''The Canadian'' and service began on April 24, 1955. Running time between Montreal and Vancouver was reduced from about 85 to 71 hours, so that passengers spent only three, rather than four, nights en route. Although CPR competitor Canadian National Railways began its own new transcontinental service, the ''[[Super Continental]]'', on the same day, CPR was able to boast honestly that ''The Canadian'' was \"The first and only all-stainless steel 'dome' stream-liner in Canada\" \u2014 it was not until 1964 that the CNR acquired dome cars from the [[Milwaukee Road]].\n\nThe train operated with Montreal and Toronto sections which ran combined west of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]]. The Montreal section (also serving [[Ottawa]]) was known as train 1 westbound and train 2 eastbound, while the Toronto section was known as train 11 westbound and train 12 eastbound.  Matching its streamlined appearance, ''The Canadian''{{'}}s 71-hour westbound schedule was 16 hours faster than that of ''The Dominion''.\n\nAlthough initially successful, passenger train ridership began to decline in Canada during the 1960s.  Facing competition from airlines and increased automobile usage following construction of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the CPR cancelled ''The Dominion'' in 1966, and petitioned the [[Government of Canada|government]] to discontinue ''The Canadian'' in 1970.  Although this petition was denied, CPR during the 1970s attempted to remove itself from the passenger service market. ''The Canadian'' was operated at reduced levels, with the government subsidizing 80 percent of its losses.[[File:VIA6506calg1982.jpg|thumb|''The Canadian'' in [[Calgary]], 1982|alt=|left]]\n\n===Service under Via Rail===\nVia Rail, a federal [[crown corporation]], formally assumed responsibility for CPR's passenger services on October 29, 1978, although the Via identity was not assumed by the trains themselves until the following summer. Following the takeover by Via, the ''Canadian'' became the company's premier transcontinental train, and initially operated over its old CPR route.  It was supplemented by the former CN ''Super Continental'', which operated over the parallel, but more northerly, CN route. The ''Canadian'' continued to be operated in two sections east of Sudbury and provided daily service west to Vancouver and east to Toronto and Montreal.[[File:TheCanadian RouteMap.png|thumb|The old (red) and new (blue) routes of ''The Canadian.''|alt=|left]]\n\nThe ''Super Continental'' was discontinued in 1981 due to sharp [[Canadian federal budget|budget]] cuts. Since then, the ''Canadian'' has Via Rail's only true transcontinental train. While the ''Super Continental'' was brought back in 1985 amid popular demand, it only ran as far east as Winnipeg.\n\nIn the aftermath of another round of deep budget cuts made to Via Rail on January 15, 1990, Via again discontinued the ''Super Continental,'' this time permanently. The ''Canadian'' was moved from CPR trackage to the CN route plied by the ''Super Continental'' for its first quarter-century, dropping the Montreal section. The new longer route bypassed [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] and [[Calgary]] in favour of [[Saskatoon]] and [[Edmonton]]. This maintained transcontinental service and allowed Via to operate its government-mandated service to small communities along the line. At the same time, the absence of transportation alternatives along the CPR route allowed entrepreneur Peter Armstrong to develop the [[Rocky Mountaineer]] excursion service.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Johnston|first=Bob|date=November 2018|title=Reflecting on Via Rail Canada at 40|magazine=TRAINS|location=Waukesha, WI|publisher=Kalmbach|volume=78|issue=11|pages=27\u20138|doi=|pmid=|quote=One factor driving the decision to move the ''Canadian'' over to the ''Super Continental''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s route was lobbying by Vancouver entrepreneur Peter Armstrong to privatize Via\u2019s summer excursions to Banff, Alta., introduced in 1988. This came with the understanding his fledgling operation would get route exclusivity and some initial financial assistance from Via to ensure the venture\u2019s success. After a few shaky early years, Armstrong invested heavily in speciality dome cars to make Rocky Mountaineer a financial and creative success in a way the publicly funded operator never could.|ref=harv|id={{ProQuest|2110411952}}}}</ref>  Moreover, while pre-1990 schedules had daily service on both the CP and CN routes, service following the 1990 cuts was a mere three days per week, reduced further to two times a week in the offseason.\n\nIn 2007 the schedule was lengthened so that the train now takes four nights, rather than three, to travel between Toronto and Vancouver.  The four-night schedule is almost identical (in terms of travel time) with that of the 1940s, despite [[Dieselisation|substantial technological change]] since then.\n\nIn 2013, the train was honoured by being featured on the back of the new polymer [[Canadian ten-dollar note|$10 Canadian bill]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/interactives/zoom-5-10-dollar-bills/ | title=Zoom : Canada's new polymer $5 and $10 bills | author=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2013-04-30 |work=CBC News| author-link=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, Via Rail continues to operate the ''Canadian'' using the rebuilt ex-CPR Budd passenger equipment.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Johnston|2018|}}.</ref>\n\nThe schedule was lengthened again effective July 26, 2018 to four days and four nights in each direction due to continuing schedule reliability problems on the host railway.<ref>https://media.viarail.ca/en/press-releases/2018/22-june-2018-via-rail-modifies-schedule-canadian</ref>\nThe ''Canadian'' currently takes 94 hours 15 minutes westbound<ref>https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/winter2018/40-41_Toronto-Winnipeg-Jasper-Vancouver.pdf</ref> vs. 95 hours 29 minutes eastbound.<ref>https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/winter2018/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf</ref> This is 13h50m vs. 12h19m slower than the ''Continental''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 80h25m vs. 83h10m<ref>https://timetableworld.com/image_viewer.php?id=3&section_id=152</ref> and 13h5m vs. 12h24m slower than the ''Dominion''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 81h10m vs. 83h5m<ref>https://timetableworld.com/image_viewer.php?id=3&section_id=155</ref> schedules from 1952.\n\nService on the Canadian (along with most of VIA's other services) was suspended due to [[protest]] blockade at several points on the Canadian National Railway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/via-rail-cancels-trains-across-canada-cn-shuts-down-eastern-canada-network-amid-pipeline-protests-1.4811036|title=VIA Rail cancels trains across Canada, CN shuts down Eastern Canada network amid pipeline protests|last=Slaughter|first=Graham|date=2020-02-13|website=CTVNews|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/via-rail-suspends-the-canadian-and-ocean-routes-because-of-covid-19-301023347.html|title=VIA Rail suspends the Canadian and Ocean routes because of COVID-19|last=Inc|first=VIA Rail Canada|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> After the blockades were lifted, within a month, the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Canada|2020 Coronavirus Pandemic]] resulted in the suspension of nearly all VIA Rail services, including all trains on the ''Canadian.''\n\n===Current operations===\nOn April March 21, 2020, the ''Canadian'' and most other VIA Rail services were suspended due to the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelweek.ca/news/via-rail-announces-service-changes-in-response-to-covid-19/|title=VIA Rail announces service changes in response to COVID-19 - Travelweek|last=Group|first=Travelweek|date=2020-03-23|website=http://www.travelweek.ca/|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> This suspension will continue until at least June 1, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/covid-19-important-updates-via-rail-extends-the-suspension-of-the-ocean-816048573.html|title=COVID-19 Important Updates - VIA Rail Extends the Suspension of the Ocean|last=Inc|first=VIA Rail Canada|website=www.newswire.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> When operating on the normal schedule, the ''Canadian'' operates twice per week, departing Toronto on Wednesdays and Sundays and Vancouver on Mondays and Fridays.

It uses the [[BNSF]] tracks through suburban communities including [[Burnaby]], to [[New Westminster]]. After the train crosses the [[New Westminster Bridge]], the ''Canadian'' leaves BNSF for CN tracks east.  From New Westminster to [[Gifford, British Columbia]], the route passes railroad yards and industry.\n\n==== Fraser and Thompson River Canyons ====\nAt Gifford, the train diverts from the CN mainline and crosses the [[Fraser River]] to [[Mission, British Columbia|Mission]]. CN and CPR utilize [[directional running]] through the [[Fraser River Canyon|Fraser]] and [[Thompson River Canyon|Thompson River]] canyons; eastbound trains use the CPR lines and westbounds the CN tracks. Thus, for the section through the two canyons, the ''Canadian'' runs on its original CPR route. From Mission to [[Cisco, British Columbia|Cisco]], the CPR runs west (north) of the river; afterwards, it runs east (south). Near [[Basque, British Columbia|Basque]], the eastbound ''Canadian'' transfers onto the CN main.\n\nWestbound, the ''Canadian'' stays on the CN tracks all the way into Vancouver. The CN route passes through Painted Canyon, and features CN's {{convert|800|ft|adj=on}} steel-arched bridge over the Fraser River and the CPR mainline at Cisco. The tracks in Painted Canyon are only approximately {{convert|200|ft}} above the Thompson River. After Cisco, the CN mainline stays of the east/south side of the Fraser River all the way to the [[New Westminster Bridge]], where the two routes merge.\n\nOn their regular schedules, both east and westbound ''Canadian''s travel through the Fraser and Thompson river canyons at night.\n\n==== Basque-Kamloops ====\nTraveling eastbound from Basque, the CN line crosses back across the [[Thompson River]].  Aside from a few brief deviations across the river, the line stays on the north/west side into just outside Kamloops.  Arriving in Kamloops, the train halts at [[Kamloops station]].\n\n=== Kamloops\u2013Jasper ===\n[[File:North Thompson River.jpg|thumb|right|CN's crossing of the [[Thompson River|North Thompson River]].]]\n[[File:Canadian following North Thompson River in BC.jpg|thumb|right|The North Thompson River and bridge from the train.]]'''North Thompson River Canyon'''\n\nFor six hours after departing Kamloops, the tracks run north, following the [[Thompson River|North Thompson River]] for much of the way and indeed crossing it several times.<ref name=\"eastbound-schedule\">{{cite web |url=http://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/october2016/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf |title=The Canadian, Eastbound Schedule |accessdate=2017-04-02 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170402231001/http://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/october2016/42-43_Vancouver-Japser-Winnipeg-Toronto.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2017 }}</ref>{{Original research inline|date=November 2018}}  The scenery changes gradually from the dry, rolling plateau \u2013 though miles of irrigation soften the starkness \u2013 to the lusher, evergreen forests. Narrow valleys bordered by mountains on both sides feature farmlands, pastures, forests, logging camps, and small communities.  The latter often have flag stops \u2014 for example, [[Clearwater, British Columbia|Clearwater]] and [[Blue River, British Columbia|Blue River]].  Near Clearwater, the train crosses the [[Clearwater River (British Columbia)|Clearwater River]]. The [[Monashee Mountains]] lie to the east for much of the way to Valemount.\n\nSome of the most dramatic scenery along the route occurs in this area as the train clings precariously to the mountainsides \u2013 particularly [[Groundhog Mountain]] and [[Mount Cheadle]].  Although [[railway slide fence]]s protect the route, the train creeps along at a cautious pace \u2013 usually {{convert|26|\u2013|30|mph}}.\n\nOn the downslope side of the train lies the North Thompson River; in the distance are often-snow-covered mountains.  The icefields of the [[Albreda Glacier]] should be visible for several miles.  At [[Little Hells Gate (Port d'Enfer)]], lies above treacherous rapids similar to [[Hells Gate (British Columbia)|Hells Gate]] farther south on the Fraser.  One of the prettiest sights in this area is of [[Pyramid Falls]], which cascades {{convert|300|ft}} down the side of Mount Cheadle. The train slows down enough for passengers to get close-up looks and maybe [[Photo op|get a nice picture or two]].\n\nSouth of [[Valemount]], the train passes a memorial to the [[Canoe River train crash|Canoe River crash]].  The train then crosses [[Canoe River (British Columbia)|the river]] over a {{convert|240|ft|adj=on}} bridge and arrives at another flag stop ([[Valemount station]]).\n\n==== Valemount\u2013Redpass ====\nNorth of Valemount, eastbound and westbound trains routes again diverge.  Eastbound trains use CN's Albreda Subdivision, which continues to climb until Milepost 65.6, a curve near [[Jackman, British Columbia|Jackman]].  The line then runs eastward at constant elevation through [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]], with views of [[Mount Robson]].  The line passes through a {{convert|1670|ft|adj=on}} tunnel, where a 1905 avalanche buried railroad workers,{{Dubious |reason=Construction of this line started in 1910|date=March 2019}} and then descends to [[Redpass, British Columbia|Redpass Junction]], where it joins with CN's Robson Subdivision.  The latter is used by westbound trains; it is lower in elevation and has more favourable grades than the Albreda Subdivision.\n\n==== Redpass-Yellowhead Pass ====\n\nRedpass Junction is near the western shore of [[Moose Lake (British Columbia)|Moose Lake]].  The lake is another scenic highlight, as the train follows along the north shore of the lake for several miles, and there are a couple of splashing waterfalls cascading down from the\u012b mountains into the lake.  The south shore of the lake is the [[Selwyn Range (British Columbia)|Selwyn Range]], which the train has essentially detoured around.  The [[Yellowhead Highway]] (Highway #16) parallels the CN tracks to the north.[[File:Jasper lake with mountains from train.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jasper Lake (Alberta)|Jasper Lake]] with mountains in the distance as seen from the ''Canadian'' passenger train.]]\n\nAfter Moose Lake, the train travels through a narrow valley nestled between the mountains, crosses the [[Moose River (British Columbia)|Moose]] and [[Fraser River|Fraser]] rivers and continues following the Fraser. Soon the train comes to the next major scenic highlight of the trip: [[Yellowhead Lake]].  Yellowhead Mountain continues to hover overhead to the north while Mounts [[Mount Rockingham|Rockingham]] ({{Cvt|7797|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Mount Fitzwilliam|Fitzwilliam]] ({{Cvt|9549|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakfinder.com/peakfinder.asp?PeakName=Mount+Fitzwilliam|title=Mount Fitzwilliam|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702045447/http://www.peakfinder.com/peakfinder.asp?PeakName=Mount+Fitzwilliam|archive-date=2 July 2003|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) can be seen to the south across the lake. The train finally crosses the [[Continental Divide]] at [[Yellowhead Pass]], which at {{Cvt|3718|ft|m}} is the lowest crossing of the divide in North America.\n\nYellowhead Pass marks the boundaries between [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]], the [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]] and [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]] time zones, the [[Watersheds of North America|Pacific and Arctic watersheds]], and [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. Once again the train hugs mountainsides among the [[Victoria Cross Range]] (to the north) above the [[Miette River]] and creeps through tunnels and past protective slide detector fences. Whistler Mountain is in view as the train descends, rounds a curve and pulls into the [[Jasper railway station|Jasper train station]].\n\n===At Jasper===\n{{main|Jasper railway station}}\nThe ''Canadian'', in both directions, is scheduled to be at Jasper station for an hour and a half for servicing.  [[Mount Edith Cavell]] ({{cvt|11,033|ft|disp=sqbr}}) is visible toward the south. [[Pyramid Mountain (Alberta)|Pyramid Mountain]] ({{cvt|9,075|ft|disp=sqbr}}) and the [[Victoria Cross Ranges]] are to the northwest.  [[The Whistlers]], to the southwest, can be summited via the [[Jasper Skytram]].\n\nPassengers are encouraged to get off the train and wander around downtown Jasper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jasper.travel/|title=Jasper, Alberta, Canada: Official Site of Tourism Jasper, AB|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>  In addition to shops and restaurants, downtown Jasper contains [[Jasper Park Information Centre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jasper-alberta.com/|title=Jasper, AB - Official Website {{!}} Official Website|website=www.jasper-alberta.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>  The centre provides maps and other information about the park and surrounding [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks|UNESCO World Heritage]] site through which the train travels.\n\nThe [[Jasper railway station|station]] itself has a few attractions: the Jasper Raven Totem Pole<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaspernationalpark.com/history/jaspers-historic-raven-totem-pole.html|title=Jasper National Park History - Jasper's Historic Raven Totem Pole|author=Aldwin Galapon, JA Media Solutions, April 2009, www.jamediasolutions.com|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> and a vintage CN [[4-8-2]] steam locomotive are on display, and inside the station is a caf\u00e9 barista that also sells railroad memorabilia and other gifts.

The railroad comes in from the northwest and rounds a curve into the station. At the station, the train is actually facing northeast. Upon leaving the station, the train continues in a more northeasterly direction rather than due east. Also the train has descended into Jasper from Yellowhead Pass and now climbs a grade shortly after leaving the Jasper railyards. The train is once again hugging mountainsides overlooking the Athabasca [[Athabasca Valley|Valley]] and [[Athabasca River|River]] and surrounding mountains. There is usually a flock of [[bighorn sheep]] grazing on the bluffs above the train to the north. During the winter, they can often be seen licking salt off the parallel [[Yellowhead Highway]].

The Yellowhead Highway rides along the south shore of the lake. The lake is a shallow, wide section of the Athabasca River. This has been the site of many CN publicity photographs\u2014including of the ''Super Continental''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.railpictures.ca/upload/via-train-3-the-westbound-super-continental-on-a-rainy-day-running-along-jasper-lake|title=Railpictures.ca - Peter Gloor Photo: Via train 3, the westbound Super Continental, on a rainy day running along Jasper Lake. {{!}} Railpictures.ca \u2013 Canadian Railway Photography \u2013 photographie ferroviaire Canadienne.|website=www.railpictures.ca|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} <!-- Citation is an WP:OR shot of Via's Super Continental at Jasper Lake, not a CN publicity photo of same -->\u2014through the years, and it is still popular with photographers, railfans, the present-day ''Canadian'', its advertisers and its passengers.

They are the only sand dunes ecosystem in the Canadian Rockies. Parts of the mainline have been built on causeways away from the shore, which have created several mini lakes. This adds to the effect of being out on the water, creating additional views of the lake, its waters and the forests and mountains surrounding it. The lake is surrounded by mountain ranges, many of which can be seen the train from various places along the lake. They include:\n\nFrom southeast to southwest:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peakfinder.com/|title=Peakfinder|website=www.peakfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>\n\n*[[Miette Range]].  Most prominent peaks include [[Utopia Mountain]] ({{Cvt|2602|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}) and [[Roche Miette]] ({{Cvt|7600|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}).\n*[[Jacques Range]]. Prominent peaks: [[Cinquefoil Mountain]] ({{convert|2259|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}),  [[Roche Jacques]] ({{convert|2603|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}), and [[Mount Merlin]] ({{convert|2711|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}).\n*[[Colin Range]]: Peaks include [[Mount Colin]] ({{convert|2687|m|disp=sqbr|abbr=on|ft}}) and [[Roche Bonhomme]] ({{convert|2495|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref name=\"peakfinder.com\" />)\n\nNorthwest to northeast:\n* [[Victoria Cross Ranges]]\n* [[De Smet Range]].

Along the way, it passes [[Black Cat Mountain]] ({{convert|1800|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=black+cat+mountain|title=Black Cat Mountain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214312/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=black+cat+mountain|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) and [[Mount Solomon]] ({{convert|1585|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=mount+solomon|title=Mount Solomon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214251/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=mount+solomon|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>). The Yellowhead Highway is on the other side of the lake. [[Folding Mountain]] ({{convert|2844|m|ft|disp=sqbr}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=folding+mountain|title=Folding Mountain|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214318/http://peakfinder.com/peakfinder.ASP?PeakName=folding+mountain|archive-date=4 October 2013|url-status=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>) should be visible as the train crosses the Athabasca River. The river is now on the north side of the tracks.\n\n==== Entrance ====\nEntrance is the official easternmost point of the Canadian Rockies (at least on the CN), but the [[Miette Range]] usually is still visible for many miles as the train heads out across the prairies.  The surrounding landscapes are still heavily forested and the riverbanks a bit dramatic, but the land slowly opens up to ever broader valleys, plains,  and farmlands.  About three miles west of Hinton, the train crosses an impressive trestle over Prairie Creek with the Athabasca still in sight. The train crosses a curved trestle over Sundance Creek just West of [[Edson, Alberta|Edson]]; then crosses the McLoed River on a {{convert|1066|ft|adj=on}} bridge and Wolf Creek on a {{convert|652|ft|adj=on}} bridge. The train rides along the shores of three lakes: to the north the Octopus Lake; to the south, Wabamun and Chip. Westbound, train passengers should be able to start seeing mountains (still way off in the distance) just after crossing the Sundance Creek trestle.\n\nThe train finally reaches West Junction [[Wye (rail)|wye]], and backs into [[Edmonton railway station (Via Rail)|Edmonton Via Rail station]].  (Westbound trains also back into the station.)  The train is scheduled to dwell at the station for an hour for a crew change and other servicing. The Panorama car travels only between Vancouver and Edmonton. Here, the car is taken off (eastbound) or put on (westbound). Edmonton station is a suburban development across the street from the former airport [[Edmonton City Centre (Blatchford Field) Airport|Blatchford Field]]; the skyline of downtown [[Edmonton]] is off in the distance.\n\n=== Edmonton to Saskatoon ===\nThe train (in both east and westbound) backs into the station upon arrival with the train facing north while standing at the station. Departing out of [[Edmonton station (Via Rail)|Edmonton station]], the train heads east past the CN Walker Yard (city skyline is visible to the south) and cuts across the Canadian prairies for nearly {{convert|470|km}}, paralleling [[Alberta Highway 14]]. The train stops in the rural communities of [[Viking, Alberta|Viking]] and [[Wainwright, Alberta]], before turning south to follow Alberta Highway 610.  The train then crosses the Alberta\u2013Saskatchewan border and stops in [[Unity, Saskatchewan]], before passing over the Killsquaw Lakes en route to [[Biggar station|Biggar]]. Now paralleling [[Saskatchewan Highway 14]], the train enters [[Saskatoon]] from the west, stopping at the modern [[Saskatoon station]] south of downtown on the site of the CN Chappell Yard via a short spur line.\n\n=== Saskatoon to Winnipeg ===\nAfter re-joining the CN main line, the train follows [[Saskatchewan Highway 11]] out of the urban core of Saskatoon before once again paralleling the Yellowhead Highway. Now heading southeast, it begins to follow [[Saskatchewan Highway 2]] into [[Watrous, Saskatchewan|Watrous]], where the tracks branch off once more. Staying on the CN main line, the train heads east towards [[Melville, Saskatchewan|Melville]], paralleling [[Saskatchewan Highway 15|Hwy. 15]], and heads southeast towards the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border. After entering Manitoba, the train stops in [[Rivers, Manitoba|Rivers]], and heads east to [[Portage la Prairie]], now following the [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. It then continues east towards Winnipeg, where the tracks turn north, following the [[Assiniboine River]], and enter the historic [[Winnipeg Union Station]]. Here, passengers can transfer to the Winnipeg-Churchill train. Northeast of Union Station, the train crosses over the [[Red River of the North|Red River Of The North]], and heads east through CN's [[Transcona Yards]]. This section has a distance of nearly 714 kilometers (443 miles).\n\n[[Image:Thecanadian with canoe.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man loading a canoe onto a baggage car, while a family watches|The ''Canadian'' picking up a canoeist in central Ontario]]\n\n=== Winnipeg to Toronto ===\nWith its journey through the prairies almost over, the train heads out of the yards and continues east, following Manitoba Provincial Trunk Hwy. 15, towards the rural community of [[Elma, Manitoba|Elma]], then turning east-northeast towards [[Brereton Lake railway station|Brereton Lake]], [[Ophir]] and [[Winnitoba railway station|Winnitoba]], and crosses the Manitoba-Ontario border after traversing [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]].  Now in Ontario, the train travels through the rugged [[Canadian Shield]], stopping at [[Rice Lake, Ontario|Rice Lake]] and [[Copelands Landing]] en route to [[Malachi, Ontario|Malachi]].  After Malachi, the train loops around and heads through [[Ottermere, Ontario|Ottermere]], [[Minaki railway station|Minaki]], [[Redditt railway station|Redditt]], [[Farlane railway station|Farlane]], [[Canyon station (Via Rail)|Canyon]] and [[Red Lake Road railway station|Red Lake Road]], where it loops around once more and stops at [[Richan]] and [[Millidge, Ontario|Millidge]], and continues into the town of [[Sioux Lookout]].  Afterwards it heads through [[Savant Lake railway station|Savant Lake]], [[Flindt Landing railway station|Flindt Landing]], [[Allanwater Bridge railway station|Allanwater Bridge]], [[Collins railway station|Collins]], [[Armstrong railway station|Armstrong]], [[Mud River railway station|Mud River]], [[Ferland railway station|Ferland]], [[Auden railway station|Auden]], [[Nakina railway station|Nakina]], [[Longlac railway station|Longlac]], [[Caramat railway station|Caramat]], and [[Hillsport railway station|Hillsport]] en route to [[Hornepayne, Ontario|Hornepayne]].  After Hornepayne, it stops at [[Oba, Ontario|Oba]], where passengers could connect with the [[Algoma Central Railway]]'s [[Agawa Canyon]] tour train until the latter's demise.  Stops are made at [[Elsas railway station|Elsas]], [[Foleyet railway station|Foleyet]], [[Gogama railway station|Gogama]], [[Westree railway station|Westree]], [[Ruel railway station|Ruel]], [[Felix railway station|Felix]], [[McKee's Camp railway station|McKee's Camp]], and [[Laforest railway station|Laforest]] before the train enters [[Capreol, Ontario|Capreol]].  At [[Sudbury, Ontario|Sudbury]], the train stops at [[Sudbury Junction station|Sudbury Junction]], where passengers can transfer via taxi to the Sudbury-[[White River, Ontario|White River]] service.  The many flag stops between Winnipeg and Sudbury are usually only accessible by rail transport, and between Winnipeg and Capreol passengers may reserve to be dropped off or picked up at any location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stops in between two stations |url=https://www.viarail.ca/en/explore-our-destinations/stations/stops-between-two-explore-our-destinations/stations |website=Via Rail Canada |publisher=Via Rail Canada |accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Parry Sound ====\nThe train then turns south towards [[Parry Sound, Ontario]] and [[Washago, Ontario]].  From the junction of [[Wanup, Ontario|Wanup]] to [[Parry Sound, Ontario|Parry Sound]], directional running with both CN and CP Railways is again put into place. This time however, eastbound (southbound) trains utilize the CN Bala Subdivision, whilst westbound (northbound) trains use the CP Parry Sound Subdivision.  Thus the latter follows its original CPR route here, traversing the [[Parry Sound CPR Trestle]]. Through Parry Sound, all trains make use of [[Parry Sound railway station|both CNR and CPR stations]] depending on the direction of travels.  At [[Bala, Ontario|Bala]], both CN's Bala Subdivision and the adjacent CPR line diverges for the final time.\n\n==== Bala to Toronto ====\nFrom Bala, the trains continue along the CN line for approximately {{Cvt|40|km|mi}} to [[Washago, Ontario|Washago]], its final stop before the Toronto terminus. A disused spur to [[Casino Rama]] is located due south, while the Bala Sub parallels the shore of [[Lake Simcoe]] as far as [[Port Bolster, Ontario|Port Bolster]] before heading southwest into [[York Region, Ontario|York Region]].  South of [[Gormley, Ontario|Gormley]], the route is shared with [[GO Transit]]'s [[Richmond Hill line]] commuter services, although the latter does not share stations with the ''Canadian''.  The ''Canadian'' passes through [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] and western [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] into the city of [[Toronto]] proper, with a scenic route paralleling the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] for the final 10&nbsp;km.\n\n=== Toronto Terminal ===\nTrains returning to Vancouver would leave Union Station either from the East as it came in from (if turned around prior), or from the West. In the latter case, the train would then proceed North along the [[CN Newmarket Subdivision|Newmarket Subdivision]], shared by GO Transit's [[Barrie line]]. This subdivision is a portion of a former route for the transcontinental line; however, the train only continues as far as Snyder Diamond in [[Vaughan]]. There it would then proceed Eastbound along the [[CN York Subdivision|York Subdivision]] towards [[Thornhill, Ontario|Thornhill]] to meet up with the [[CN Bala Subdivision|Bala Subdivision]] at Doncaster Diamond and from there continue Northwest leaving the Greater Toronto Area towards Washago and eventually Vancouver.\n\n==Ridership, subsidies, and fares==\nIn 2014, the train served 93,810 passengers receiving a government subsidy of $591 per entrained passenger or $0.50 per passenger mile.<ref>Via Rail 2014 Annual Report</ref>   Because the ''Canadian'' is used primarily by tourists, these subsidies have been the source of significant criticism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/romanticism-shields-outrageous-via-rail-subsidies-ex-tory-minister/article4102147/|title=Romanticism shields 'outrageous' Via Rail subsidies: ex-Tory minister|last=|first=|date=|work=The Globe and Mail|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nMost fares on the Canadian between major cities exceed the cost of discounted pre-purchase scheduled air travel by a fair margin, even in Economy Class.

From the sixteenth until the twentieth centuries, the village of [[Kamasan]], [[Klungkung]] (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the twentieth century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art.\n\nUbud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silver smiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">{{cite book| last=Eiseman| first=Fred and Margaret| title=Woodcarving of Bali| publisher=Periplus| year=1988}}</ref> Balinese paintings are notable for their highly vigorous yet refined, intricate art that resembles baroque folk art with tropical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aclhs-web-pro-1.ucc.usyd.edu.au/HEURIST_FILESTORE/balipaintings/Forgecataloguesinglefile.pdf|title=Balinese Traditional Paintings|author=Forge, Anthony|publisher=The Australian Museum|date=1978|accessdate=20 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220200212/http://aclhs-web-pro-1.ucc.usyd.edu.au/HEURIST_FILESTORE/balipaintings/Forgecataloguesinglefile.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Recent history ==\n\nPrior to the 1920s, Balinese traditional paintings were mainly found what is now known as the [[Kamasan]] or [[Wayang]] style. These are visual presentation of narratives, especially of the Hindu-Javanese epics\u2014\u2014the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]\u2014\u2014as well as a number of indigenous stories, such as the Malat, depicting [[Panji (prince)|Panji]] narratives and the Brayut story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baliwoodresort.com/kamasanexhibition.htm |title=The Realm of Balinese Classical Art Form |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402092652/http://www.baliwoodresort.com/kamasanexhibition.htm |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n[[File:Detail_of_Antique_Kamasan_Balinese_Painting.jpg|thumb|right|Nineteenth century Kamasan Palindon Painting detail - courtesy The Wovensouls Collection, Singapore]]\nThese two-dimensional drawings are traditionally drawn on cloth or bark paper (Ulantaga or daluwang paper), and sometimes on wood, with [[natural dye]]s. The colouring is limited to available natural dyes: red from volcanic rocks, ochre, blue from indigo, and black from soot. In addition, the rendering of the figures and ornamentations must follow strictly prescribed rules, since they are mostly produced for religious articles and temple hangings. These paintings are produced collaboratively, and therefore mostly anonymously.\n\nThere were many experiments with new types of art by Balinese from the late nineteenth century onwards. These experiments were stimulated by access to new materials (western paper and imported inks and paint), and by the 1930s, new tourist markets stimulated many young Balinese to be involved in new types of art.\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nOn his first visit to Bali in 1930, the Mexican artist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] noted that local paintings served primarily religious or ceremonial functions. They were used as decorative cloths to be hung in temples and important houses, or as calendars to determine children's horoscopes. Yet within a few years, he found the art form had undergone a \"liberating revolution.\" Where they had once been severely restricted by subject (mainly episodes from Hindu mythology) and style, Balinese artists began to produce scenes from rural life. These painters had developed increasing individuality.<ref name=\"Covarubias\" />\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| year=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.<ref name=\"JC\">\n{{cite book\n| last = Couteau\n| first = Jean\n| title = Catalogue of the Museum Puri Lukisan\n| publisher = Ratna Wartha Foundation (i.e. the Museum Puri Lukisan)\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = 979-95713-0-8\n}}\n</ref>\nMore importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art. The 1930s styles were consolidated in the 1950s, and in more recent years have been given the confusing title of \"modern traditional Balinese painting\". The Ubud painters, although a minority amongst the artists working in the 1930s, became the representatives of the new style thanks to the presence of the great artist Gusti Nyoman Lempad in that village, and to the patronage of the traditional rulers of Ubud. The key points of the Ubud Style included a concentration on the depiction of daily Bali life and drama; the change of the patron of these artists from the religious temples and royal houses to western tourists/collectors; shifting the picture composition from multiple to single focus.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\">{{cite book\n |last         = Spanjaard\n |first        = Helena\n |title        = Pioneers of Balinese Painting\n |publisher    = [[KIT Publishers]]\n |date         = December 2007\n |isbn         = 978-90-6832-447-1\n |url          = http://www.kit.nl/smartsite.shtml?ch=FAB&id=8332&ItemID=2156&RecordTitle=Pioneers%20of%20Balinese%20painting\n |access-date  = 2007-12-09\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090806020317/http://www.kit.nl/smartsite.shtml?ch=FAB&id=8332&ItemID=2156&RecordTitle=Pioneers%20of%20Balinese%20painting\n |archive-date = 2009-08-06\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\nDespite the adoption of modern western painting traditions by many Balinese and [[Indonesia]]n painters, \"modern traditional Balinese painting\" is still thriving and continues by descendants/students of the artists of the pre-war modernist era (1928-1942). The schools of modern traditional Balinese painting include: Ubud, Batuan, [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]], Young Artist and Keliki schools of painting.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\" />\n\n== Modern traditional painting ==\nThe pre-War modernisation of Balinese art emanated from three villages: Ubud, where Spies settled, Sanur on the southern coast, and Batuan, a traditional hub of musicians, dancers, carvers and painters. The artists painted mostly on paper, though canvas and board were also used. Often, the works featured repetitive clusters of stylized foliage or waves that conveyed a sense of texture, even perspective. Each village evolved a style of its own. Ubud artists made more use of open spaces and emphasized human figures. Sanur paintings often featured erotic scenes and animals, and work from Batuan was less colorful but tended to be busier.<ref name=\"Dermawan\">Agus Dermawan,'' Bali Bravo&nbsp;\u2014 a Lexicon of 200 years Balinese Traditional Painters'', Bali Bangkit, 2006.</ref>\n\n=== Ubud painting ===\n[[File:Mask Dancer (by A.A. Gde Anom Sukawati).jpg|upright|thumb|right|Mask Dancer, A.A. Gde Anom Sukawati (b. 1966), Acrylic on canvas]]\n\nUbud became a center for art in the 1930s, under the patronage of the lords of Ubud, who rose to power at the end of the nineteenth century. Prior to the 1930s, traditional [[wayang]] style paintings from other villages may have been found in Ubud, but was more influential in the nearby village of Peliatan, which is nowadays classified as part of Ubud. Significant Ubud artist were already adapting versions of the wayang style by the end of the 1920s, notably Ida Bagus Kembeng of Tebesaya, who may have studied with relatives in nearby Tampaksiring village. [[I Gusti Nyoman Lempad]], who had come to Ubud under the patronage of its ruling lord, changed from being an architect and sculpture to executing outstanding drawings around 1931. [[Anak Agung Gde Sobrat]] of Ubud also began to paint around this time. These and other artists were given materials and opportunities to sell their work by the resident European artists Walter Spies and Rudolf Bonnet. They developed experimental styles which European commentators identified as a new, modern type of Balinese art, differentiated from the traditional art which is governed by strict rules of religious iconography.\n\nUnder the patronage of the Ubud royal family, especially Tjokorda Gde Agung Sukawati, and with Rudolf Bonnet as a chief consultant, the Pitamaha Art Guild was founded in 1936 as a way to professionalise Balinese painting. Its mission was to preserve the quality of Balinese Art in the rush of tourism to Bali. The board members of Pitamaha met regularly to select paintings submitted by its members, and to conduct exhibitions throughout Indonesia and abroad. Between 1936 and 1939, Bonnet organised significant exhibitions of this modern Balinese art in the Netherlands, with a smaller exhibition in London. Pitamaha was active until the Second World War came to Bali in 1942. Ubud artists who were members to Pitamaha came from Ubud and its surrounding villages: Pengosekan, Peliatan and Tebasaya. Among them, besides those mentioned above, were: The three sons of Ida Bagus Kembeng: Ida Bagus Wiri, [[Ida Bagus Made]] and Ida Bagus Belawa; Tjokorda Oka of the royal house of Peliatan; Sobrat and his family members, including Anak Agung Gde Meregeg, I Dewa Putu Bedil, I Dewa Nyoman Leper, Anak Agung Dana of Padangtegal; and I Gusti Ketut Kobot, his brother I Gusti Made Baret, I Wayan Gedot, Dewa Putu Mokoh of Pengosekan. Artists from other areas also participated, including Pan Seken from Kamasan, I Gusti Made Deblog from Denpasar, and some of the Sanur artists.\n\nAlthough short-lived, Pitamaha is identified with the outpouring of modern art of the 1930s which preceded it, and with succeeding developments in art. Artists from Ubud have continued the Pitamaha tradition. Important amongst these Ubud Artists are Ida Bagus Sena (nephew of Ida Bagus Made Poleng), A.A Gde Anom Sukawati (son of A.A Raka Pudja), I Ketut Budiana, I Nyoman Kayun and I Nyoman Meja. Budiana is the artist with the one of the most impressive solo-exhibition track records. His paintings are collected by Fukuoka Museum of Arts, Bentara Budaya Jakarta, Museum Puri Lukisan, Neka Museum and Arma Museum.\nIda Bagus Sena also has developed a unique style and has a deep understanding of Balinese philosophy in his paintings. Anom Sukawati is Balinese most successful colorist. I Nyoman Meja developed a style which is closely copy by several of his students. I Nyoman Kayun received the Bali Bangkit award in 2008.\n\n=== Batuan painting ===\nThe Batuan school of painting is practiced by artists in the village of Batuan, which is situated {{convert|10|km}} to the south of Ubud. The Batuan artisans are gifted dancers, sculptors and painters. Leading artists of the 1930s included I Nyoman Ngendon, and a number of members of leading [[brahman]] families, including Ida Bagus Made Togog. Other major Batuan artists from the pre-modernist era include I Dewa Nyoman Mura (1877-1950) and I Dewa Putu Kebes (1874-1962), who were known as sanging; traditional [[Wayang]]-style painters for temples' ceremonial textiles.\n\nThe western influence in Batuan did not reach the intensity it had in Ubud.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\" /> According to [[Claire Holt (art historian)|Claire Holt]], the Batuan paintings were often dark, crowded representations of either legendary scenes or themes from daily life, but they portrayed above all fearsome nocturnal moments when grotesque spooks, freakish animal monsters, and witches accosted people. This is particularly true for paintings collected by Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson during their field studies in Bali in 1936 to 1939.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\" /> Gradations of black to white ink washes laid over most of the surface, so as to create an atmosphere of darkness and gloom. In the later years, the designs covered the entire space, which often contributed to the crowded nature of these paintings.\n\n[[File:Murtika.jpg|thumb|left|The Wheel of Life, I Ketut Murtika (b. 1952), Gouache on canvas]]\n\nAmong the early Batuan artists, [[I Nyoman Ngendon|I Ngendon]] (1903-1946) was considered the most innovative Batuan School painter.<ref name=\"JC\" /> Ngendon was not only a good painter, but a shrewd business man and political activist. He encouraged and mobilized his neighbours and friends to paint for tourist consumption. His ability in portraiture played an important role in teaching his fellow villagers in Batuan more than Spies and Bonnet.<ref name=\"JC\" /> The major Batuan artists from this period were: I Patera (1900-1935), I Tombos (b. 1917), [[Ida Bagus Made Togog|Ida Bagus Togog]] (1913-1989), Ida Bagus Made Jatasura (1917-1946), Ida Bagus Ketut Diding (1914-1990), I Made Djata (1920-2001), and Ida Bagus Widja (1912-1992). The spirit of the Pitamaha period is still strong and continues by contemporary Batuan Artists such as I Made Budi, I Wayan Bendi (b. 1950), I Ketut Murtika (b. 1952), I Made Sujendra (b. 1964), and many others. I Made Budi and I Wayan Bendi paintings capture the influence of tourism in modern life in Bali. They place tourists with their camera, riding a motorbike or surfing in the midst of Balinese traditional village activities. The dichotomy of modern and traditional Balinese life are contrasted starkly in harmony. I Ketut Murtika ( still paints the traditional story of Mahabharata and Ramayana in a painstaking details with subdued colors. His painting of the Wheel of Life viewed from the Balinese beliefs system shows his mastery of local legends and painstaking attention to details.<ref name=\"H\u00f6hn-Reflections_of_Faith\">\n{{cite book\n| last=H\u00f6hn\n| first=Klaus\n| title=Reflections of Faith: The History of Painting in Batuan, 1834-1994: The Art of Bali\n| publisher=Published by Pictures Publishers Art Books\n| year=1997\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Sanur painting ===\n[[File:Ida Bagus Rai Beached Whale.jpg|thumb|right|Beached Whale, Ida Bagus Nyoman Rai, Ink wash on canvas]]\n\nUnlike Ubud and Batuan which are located in the inland of Bali, Sanur is a beach resort. Sanur was the home of the well known Belgian artist Le Mayeur de Mepres, who lived with a Balinese wife (Ni Polok) and had a beach house in Sanur beach, although he had no interaction with local artists. \n\nTourists in the 1930s came to Bali on cruise ships docked in Sanur and made side trips to Ubud and neighboring tourist sites. Its prime location provided the Sanur artist with ready-access to Western tourists who frequented the shop of the Neuhaus Brothers who sold balinese souvenirs and had a tropical fish aquarium. The Neuhaus brothers became the major dealers of Sanur paintings and other local art. The beach around Sanur, full of outriggers and open horizon, provided local artists with a visual environment different from the Ubud and Batuan, which are located in the hinterland. The playful atmosphere pervades the Sanur paintings, and are not dictated by the religious iconography.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\" /> It is lighter and airy than those of Batuan and Ubud with sea creatures, erotic scenery and wild animals drawn in rhythmic patterns. It is possible that these works, and those of Batuan, influenced the European artist M.C. Escher. Most early works were black and white ink wash on paper, but at the request of Neuhaus, latter works were adorned with light pastel colors often added by a small number of the artists who specialised in coloring black and white drawings, notably I Pica and I Regug, who left their Balinese initials the margins.\n\nThe Sanur school of painting is the most stylized and decorative among all modern Balinese Art. Major artists from Sanur are I Rundu, [[Ida Bagus Nyoman Rai]], Ida [Bagus] Made Pugug, I Soekaria, I [Gusti] Made Rundu, and I Pica. I Rudin, who lived nearby in Renon, started to paint in mid-1930s, and in the 1950s turned to drawing balinese dancers in the manner of the drawings of [[Miguel Covarrubias]].\n\n[[File:Pugur001.jpg|thumb|left| The snake tree, I Wayan Pugur, Gouache on paper]]\n\n=== Young Artist painting ===\nThe development of the Young Artist School of painting is attributed to the Dutch artist [[Arie Smit]], a Dutch soldier who served during the 2nd world war and decided to stay in Bali. In the early 1960s, he came across children in the village of [[Penestanan]] near Tjampuhan drawing on the sand. He encouraged these children to paint by providing them with paper and paints.<ref name=\"JC\" />\n\nTheir paintings are characterized by \"child-like\" drawings that lacks details and bright colors drawn with oil paint on canvas. By the 1970s, it attracted around three hundred peasant painters to produce paintings for tourists. In 1971 Datuk Lim Chong Kit held an exhibition of Young Artists work from his collection, at Alpha Gallery in Singapore entitled [https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/pictures/Details/5aad5799-1073-42f0-b094-3a691e6535d8 ''Peasant Painters of Bali'']. A version of that exhibition was held in 1983 at the National Gallery of [[Malaysia]]..\n\nThe painting by I Wayan Pugur (b. 1945) shown here, was executed when he was 13 years old and was exhibited at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1964, as part of a traveling exhibition in the United States in 1964-1965, which was also exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution. This early drawing, executed on paper, exhibits the use of bright colors and a balanced composition. The drawing space is divided into three solid-color areas: dark blue, bright yellow and magenta in between showing the influence of the Wayang painting tradition. The leaves of the large tree with the snakes show the juxtaposition of complementary colors. The faces of the figures were drawn with no details, yet the snakes have eyes and long tongues.\n\nMajor artists from the Young Artist School are I Wayan Pugur, [[I Ketut Soki]],<ref name=\"Soki\">\n{{cite web\n| last=Soki\n| first=Ketut\n| authorlink=I Ketut Soki\n| title=Pak Soki.

I Ketut Sana learnt to paint from I Gusti Nyoman Sudara Lempad from Ubud and from I Wayan Rajin from Batuan. He combined the line drawing of Lempad and the details of the Batuan school. Every inch of the space is covered with minute details of Balinese village life and legends drawn in ink and colored with watercolor. The outcome is a marriage between the youthfulness of the Ubud school and the details of the Batuan School. The Keliki artists proud with their patience to paint minute details of every objects meticulously that occupy the drawing space.\n\nIllustrated on the left is a drawing by I Lunga (c. 1995) depicting the story of Rajapala. Rajapala is often referred to as the first Balinese voyeur or \u201cpeeping Tom.\u201d According to the story, Rajapala catches sight of a group of celestial nymphs bathing in a pool. He approaches stealthily, and without their knowledge, steals the skirt (kamben) of the prettiest, Sulaish. As her clothing contains magical powers enabling her to fly, the nymph cannot return home. Rajapala offers to marry her. She accepts on the condition that she will return to heaven after the birth of a child. With time, she and Rajapala have a healthy young son. Years pass, and one day, Sulaish accidentally discovers her clothing hidden in the kitchen. Understanding that she has been tricked, she takes leave of her husband and son and goes back to her heavenly abode.\n\nMajor artists from the Keliki Artist School are Sang Ketut Mandera (Dolit),<ref name=\"Dermawan\" /> I Ketut Sana, I Wayan Surana, I Lunga, I Wayan Nengah, I Made Ocen, Gong Juna, I Made Widi, I Wayan Lanus, I Wayan Lodra,<ref name=\"Dermawan\" /> Ida Bagus Putra, Gusti Ngurah Putra Riong and many others.\n\n== Other Schools of Painting ==\n\n===Fingerprint painting===\nA [[Balinese people|Balinese]] of royal descent, I Gusti Ngurah Gede Pemecutan makes his paintings by fingerprints.

The creative outburst emerged during this transition period is often attributed to western influences. In 2006, an exhibition at the Nusantara Museum, Delft, the Netherlands Leidelmeijer<ref name=\"FL\">Frans Leidermeijer, ''Art Deco beelden van Bali (1930-1970) - van souvenir tot kunstobject'', Waanders, 2006, {{ISBN|90-400-8186-7}}</ref> traced the Art Deco influence on Balinese wood carving. Leidelmeijer further conjectured that the Art Deco influence continued well into the 1970s.\n\nDuring the transition years, the Pitamaha Artist Guild was the prime mover not only for Balinese paintings, but also for the development of modern Balinese wood carvings. I Tagelan (1902-1935) produced an elongated carving of a Balinese woman from a long piece of wood that was given by Walter Spies, who originally requested him to produce two statues.<ref name=\"JC\" /> This carving is in the collection of the Puri Lukisan Museum in Ubud.\n\nOther masters of Balinese modernist woodcarving were: Ida Bagus Nyana, Tjokot (1886-1971)<ref name=\"Eiseman\" /> and Ida Bagus Tilem.\nIda Bagus Nyana was known for experimenting with mass in sculpture. When carving human characters, he shortened some parts of the body and lengthened others, thus bringing an eerie, surreal quality to his work. At the same time he didn't overwork the wood and adopted simple, naive themes of daily life. He thus avoided the \u201cbaroque\u201d trap, unlike many carvers of his day.\n\nTjokot gained a reputation for exploiting the expressive quality inherent in the wood. He would go into the forest to look for strangely shaped trunks and branches and, changing them as little as possible, transforming them into gnarled spooks and demonic figures.<ref name=\"Eiseman\" />\n\nIda Bagus Tilem, the son of Nyana, furthered Nyana and Tjokot's innovations both in his working of the wood and in his choice of themes. Unlike the sculptors from the previous generation, he was daring enough to alter the proportions of the characters depicted in his carving. He allowed the natural deformations in the wood to guide the form of his carving, using gnarled logs well suited for representing twisted human bodies. He saw each deformed log or branch as a medium for expressing human feelings. Instead of depicting myths or scenes of daily life, Tilem took up \u201cabstract\u201d themes with philosophical or psychological content: using distorted pieces of wood that are endowed with strong expressive powers.<ref name=\"Eiseman\" /> Ida Bagus Tilem, however, was not only an artist, but also a teacher. He trained dozens of young sculptors from the area around the village of Mas. He taught them how to select wood for its expressive power, and how to establish dialogue between wood and Man that has become the mainstream of today's Balinese woodcarving.\n\n== Museums holding important Balinese painting collection ==\nThere are many museums throughout the world holding a significant collection of Balinese paintings.<ref name=\"Haks\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Haks\n| first=Frans\n|author2=Kunsthal Rotterdam\n| title=Pre-war Balinese Modernists, 1928-1942\n| publisher=Ars et Animatio\n| year=1999\n| isbn=90-5349-297-6\n}}</ref>\n\n* '''Europe:''' In the Netherlands, the [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam and the Ethnographic Museum in Leiden, Museum Nusantara in Delft have a large number of paintings from the Wayang period (before the 1920s) and the pre-War period (1920s - 1950s).

From the sixteenth until the twentieth centuries, the village of [[Kamasan]], [[Klungkung]] (East Bali), was the centre of classical Balinese art. During the first part of the twentieth century, new varieties of Balinese art developed. Since the late twentieth century, [[Ubud]] and its neighboring villages established a reputation as the center of Balinese art.\n\nUbud and [[Batuan, Bali|Batuan]] are known for their paintings, [[Mas, Indonesia|Mas]] for their woodcarvings, Celuk for gold and silver smiths, and Batubulan for their stone carvings.

Eiseman correctly pointed out that Balinese art is actually carved, painted, woven, and prepared into objects intended for everyday use rather than as ''object d 'art.''<ref name=\"Eiseman\">{{cite book| last=Eiseman| first=Fred and Margaret| title=Woodcarving of Bali| publisher=Periplus| year=1988}}</ref> Balinese paintings are notable for their highly vigorous yet refined, intricate art that resembles baroque folk art with tropical themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aclhs-web-pro-1.ucc.usyd.edu.au/HEURIST_FILESTORE/balipaintings/Forgecataloguesinglefile.pdf|title=Balinese Traditional Paintings|author=Forge, Anthony|publisher=The Australian Museum|date=1978|accessdate=20 December 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220200212/http://aclhs-web-pro-1.ucc.usyd.edu.au/HEURIST_FILESTORE/balipaintings/Forgecataloguesinglefile.pdf|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Recent history ==\n\nPrior to the 1920s, Balinese traditional paintings were restricted to what is now known as the [[Kamasan]] or [[Wayang]] style. It is a visual narrative of Hindu-Javanese epics: the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], as well as a number of indigenous stories, such as the [[Panji (prince)|Panji]] narrative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baliwoodresort.com/kamasanexhibition.htm |title=The Realm of Balinese Classical Art Form |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402092652/http://www.baliwoodresort.com/kamasanexhibition.htm |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n[[File:Detail_of_Antique_Kamasan_Balinese_Painting.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-1920 Kamasan Palindon Painting detail - courtesy The Wovensouls Collection, Singapore]]\nThese two-dimensional drawings are traditionally drawn on cloth or bark paper (Ulantaga paper) with [[natural dye]]s. The coloring is limited to available natural dyes: red, ochre, black, etc. In addition, the rendering of the figures and ornamentations must follow strictly prescribed rules, since they are mostly produced for religious articles and temple hangings. These paintings are produced collaboratively, and therefore mostly anonymously.\n\nThere were many experiments with new types of art by Balinese from the late nineteenth century onwards. These experiments were stimulated by access to new materials (western paper and imported inks and paint), and by the 1930s, new tourist markets stimulated many young Balinese to be involved in new types of art.\n\nIn the 1920s, with the arrival of many western artists, Bali became an artist enclave (as [[Tahiti]] was for [[Paul Gauguin]]) for avant-garde artists such as [[Walter Spies]] (German), [[Rudolf Bonnet]] (Dutch), [[Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur]] (Belgian), [[Arie Smit]] (Dutch) and [[Donald Friend]] (Australian) in more recent years. Most of these western artists had very little influence on the Balinese until the post-World War Two period, although some accounts over-emphasise the western presence at the expense of recognising Balinese creativity.\n\nOn his first visit to Bali in 1930, the Mexican artist [[Miguel Covarrubias]] noted that local paintings served primarily religious or ceremonial functions. They were used as decorative cloths to be hung in temples and important houses, or as calendars to determine children's horoscopes. Yet within a few years, he found the art form had undergone a \"liberating revolution.\" Where they had once been severely restricted by subject (mainly episodes from Hindu mythology) and style, Balinese artists began to produce scenes from rural life. These painters had developed increasing individuality.<ref name=\"Covarubias\" />\n\nThis groundbreaking period of creativity reached a peak in the late 1930s. A stream of famous visitors, including [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the [[anthropologist]]s [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Margaret Mead]], encouraged the talented locals to create highly original works. During their stay in Bali in mid-1930s, Bateson and Mead collected over 2000 paintings, predominantly from the village of Batuan, but also from the coastal village of Sanur.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Geertz\n| first=Hildred\n| title=Images of Power: Balinese Paintings Made for Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead\n| publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n| year=1994\n| isbn=978-0-8248-1679-7\n}}</ref>\nAmong western artists, Spies and Bonnet are often credited for the modernization of traditional Balinese paintings. From the 1950s onwards Baliese artists incorporated aspects of perspective and anatomy from these artists.<ref name=\"JC\">\n{{cite book\n| last = Couteau\n| first = Jean\n| title = Catalogue of the Museum Puri Lukisan\n| publisher = Ratna Wartha Foundation (i.e. the Museum Puri Lukisan)\n| year = 1999\n| isbn = 979-95713-0-8\n}}\n</ref>\nMore importantly, they acted as agents of change by encouraging experimentation, and promoted departures from tradition. The result was an explosion of individual expression that increased the rate of change in Balinese art. The 1930s styles were consolidated in the 1950s, and in more recent years have been given the confusing title of \"modern traditional Balinese painting\". The Ubud painters, although a minority amongst the artists working in the 1930s, became the representatives of the new style thanks to the presence of the great artist Gusti Nyoman Lempad in that village, and to the patronage of the traditional rulers of Ubud. The key points of the Ubud Style included a concentration on the depiction of daily Bali life and drama; the change of the patron of these artists from the religious temples and royal houses to western tourists/collectors; shifting the picture composition from multiple to single focus.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\">{{cite book\n |last         = Spanjaard\n |first        = Helena\n |title        = Pioneers of Balinese Painting\n |publisher    = [[KIT Publishers]]\n |date         = December 2007\n |isbn         = 978-90-6832-447-1\n |url          = http://www.kit.nl/smartsite.shtml?ch=FAB&id=8332&ItemID=2156&RecordTitle=Pioneers%20of%20Balinese%20painting\n |access-date  = 2007-12-09\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090806020317/http://www.kit.nl/smartsite.shtml?ch=FAB&id=8332&ItemID=2156&RecordTitle=Pioneers%20of%20Balinese%20painting\n |archive-date = 2009-08-06\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\nDespite the adoption of modern western painting traditions by many Balinese and [[Indonesia]]n painters, \"modern traditional Balinese painting\" is still thriving and continues by descendants/students of the artists of the pre-war modernist era (1928-1942). The schools of modern traditional Balinese painting include: Ubud, Batuan, [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]], Young Artist and Keliki schools of painting.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\" />\n\n== Modern traditional painting ==\nThe pre-War modernisation of Balinese art emanated from three villages: Ubud, where Spies settled, Sanur on the southern coast, and Batuan, a traditional hub of musicians, dancers, carvers and painters. The artists painted mostly on paper, though canvas and board were also used. Often, the works featured repetitive clusters of stylized foliage or waves that conveyed a sense of texture, even perspective. Each village evolved a style of its own. Ubud artists made more use of open spaces and emphasized human figures. Sanur paintings often featured erotic scenes and animals, and work from Batuan was less colorful but tended to be busier.<ref name=\"Dermawan\">Agus Dermawan,'' Bali Bravo&nbsp;\u2014 a Lexicon of 200 years Balinese Traditional Painters'', Bali Bangkit, 2006.</ref>\n\n=== Ubud painting ===\n[[File:Mask Dancer (by A.A. Gde Anom Sukawati).jpg|upright|thumb|right|Mask Dancer, A.A. Gde Anom Sukawati (b. 1966), Acrylic on canvas]]\n\nUbud became a center for art in the 1930s, under the patronage of the lords of Ubud, who rose to power at the end of the nineteenth century. Prior to the 1930s, traditional [[wayang]] style paintings from other villages may have been found in Ubud, but was more influential in the nearby village of Peliatan, which is nowadays classified as part of Ubud. Significant Ubud artist were already adapting versions of the wayang style by the end of the 1920s, notably Ida Bagus Kembeng of Tebesaya, who may have studied with relatives in nearby Tampaksiring village. [[I Gusti Nyoman Lempad]], who had come to Ubud under the patronage of its ruling lord, changed from being an architect and sculpture to executing outstanding drawings around 1931. [[Anak Agung Gde Sobrat]] of Ubud also began to paint around this time. These and other artists were given materials and opportunities to sell their work by the resident European artists Walter Spies and Rudolf Bonnet. They developed experimental styles which European commentators identified as a new, modern type of Balinese art, differentiated from the traditional art which is governed by strict rules of religious iconography.\n\nUnder the patronage of the Ubud royal family, especially Tjokorda Gde Agung Sukawati, and with Rudolf Bonnet as a chief consultant, the Pitamaha Art Guild was founded in 1936 as a way to professionalise Balinese painting. Its mission was to preserve the quality of Balinese Art in the rush of tourism to Bali. The board members of Pitamaha met regularly to select paintings submitted by its members, and to conduct exhibitions throughout Indonesia and abroad. Between 1936 and 1939, Bonnet organised significant exhibitions of this modern Balinese art in the Netherlands, with a smaller exhibition in London. Pitamaha was active until the Second World War came to Bali in 1942. Ubud artists who were members to Pitamaha came from Ubud and its surrounding villages: Pengosekan, Peliatan and Tebasaya. Among them, besides those mentioned above, were: The three sons of Ida Bagus Kembeng: Ida Bagus Wiri, [[Ida Bagus Made]] and Ida Bagus Belawa; Tjokorda Oka of the royal house of Peliatan; Sobrat and his family members, including Anak Agung Gde Meregeg, I Dewa Putu Bedil, I Dewa Nyoman Leper, Anak Agung Dana of Padangtegal; and I Gusti Ketut Kobot, his brother I Gusti Made Baret, I Wayan Gedot, Dewa Putu Mokoh of Pengosekan. Artists from other areas also participated, including Pan Seken from Kamasan, I Gusti Made Deblog from Denpasar, and some of the Sanur artists.\n\nAlthough short-lived, Pitamaha is identified with the outpouring of modern art of the 1930s which preceded it, and with succeeding developments in art. Artists from Ubud have continued the Pitamaha tradition. Important amongst these Ubud Artists are Ida Bagus Sena (nephew of Ida Bagus Made Poleng), A.A Gde Anom Sukawati (son of A.A Raka Pudja), I Ketut Budiana, I Nyoman Kayun and I Nyoman Meja. Budiana is the artist with the one of the most impressive solo-exhibition track records. His paintings are collected by Fukuoka Museum of Arts, Bentara Budaya Jakarta, Museum Puri Lukisan, Neka Museum and Arma Museum.\nIda Bagus Sena also has developed a unique style and has a deep understanding of Balinese philosophy in his paintings. Anom Sukawati is Balinese most successful colorist. I Nyoman Meja developed a style which is closely copy by several of his students. I Nyoman Kayun received the Bali Bangkit award in 2008.\n\n=== Batuan painting ===\nThe Batuan school of painting is practiced by artists in the village of Batuan, which is situated {{convert|10|km}} to the south of Ubud. The Batuan artisans are gifted dancers, sculptors and painters. Leading artists of the 1930s included I Nyoman Ngendon, and a number of members of leading [[brahman]] families, including Ida Bagus Made Togog. Other major Batuan artists from the pre-modernist era include I Dewa Nyoman Mura (1877-1950) and I Dewa Putu Kebes (1874-1962), who were known as sanging; traditional [[Wayang]]-style painters for temples' ceremonial textiles.\n\nThe western influence in Batuan did not reach the intensity it had in Ubud.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\" /> According to [[Claire Holt (art historian)|Claire Holt]], the Batuan paintings were often dark, crowded representations of either legendary scenes or themes from daily life, but they portrayed above all fearsome nocturnal moments when grotesque spooks, freakish animal monsters, and witches accosted people. This is particularly true for paintings collected by Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson during their field studies in Bali in 1936 to 1939.<ref name=\"Geertz-Images_of_Power\" /> Gradations of black to white ink washes laid over most of the surface, so as to create an atmosphere of darkness and gloom. In the later years, the designs covered the entire space, which often contributed to the crowded nature of these paintings.\n\n[[File:Murtika.jpg|thumb|left|The Wheel of Life, I Ketut Murtika (b. 1952), Gouache on canvas]]\n\nAmong the early Batuan artists, [[I Nyoman Ngendon|I Ngendon]] (1903-1946) was considered the most innovative Batuan School painter.<ref name=\"JC\" /> Ngendon was not only a good painter, but a shrewd business man and political activist. He encouraged and mobilized his neighbours and friends to paint for tourist consumption. His ability in portraiture played an important role in teaching his fellow villagers in Batuan more than Spies and Bonnet.<ref name=\"JC\" /> The major Batuan artists from this period were: I Patera (1900-1935), I Tombos (b. 1917), [[Ida Bagus Made Togog|Ida Bagus Togog]] (1913-1989), Ida Bagus Made Jatasura (1917-1946), Ida Bagus Ketut Diding (1914-1990), I Made Djata (1920-2001), and Ida Bagus Widja (1912-1992). The spirit of the Pitamaha period is still strong and continues by contemporary Batuan Artists such as I Made Budi, I Wayan Bendi (b. 1950), I Ketut Murtika (b. 1952), I Made Sujendra (b. 1964), and many others. I Made Budi and I Wayan Bendi paintings capture the influence of tourism in modern life in Bali. They place tourists with their camera, riding a motorbike or surfing in the midst of Balinese traditional village activities. The dichotomy of modern and traditional Balinese life are contrasted starkly in harmony. I Ketut Murtika ( still paints the traditional story of Mahabharata and Ramayana in a painstaking details with subdued colors. His painting of the Wheel of Life viewed from the Balinese beliefs system shows his mastery of local legends and painstaking attention to details.<ref name=\"H\u00f6hn-Reflections_of_Faith\">\n{{cite book\n| last=H\u00f6hn\n| first=Klaus\n| title=Reflections of Faith: The History of Painting in Batuan, 1834-1994: The Art of Bali\n| publisher=Published by Pictures Publishers Art Books\n| year=1997\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Sanur painting ===\n[[File:Ida Bagus Rai Beached Whale.jpg|thumb|right|Beached Whale, Ida Bagus Nyoman Rai, Ink wash on canvas]]\n\nUnlike Ubud and Batuan which are located in the inland of Bali, Sanur is a beach resort. Sanur was the home of the well known Belgian artist Le Mayeur de Mepres, who lived with a Balinese wife (Ni Polok) and had a beach house in Sanur beach, although he had no interaction with local artists. \n\nTourists in the 1930s came to Bali on cruise ships docked in Sanur and made side trips to Ubud and neighboring tourist sites. Its prime location provided the Sanur artist with ready-access to Western tourists who frequented the shop of the Neuhaus Brothers who sold balinese souvenirs and had a tropical fish aquarium. The Neuhaus brothers became the major dealers of Sanur paintings and other local art. The beach around Sanur, full of outriggers and open horizon, provided local artists with a visual environment different from the Ubud and Batuan, which are located in the hinterland. The playful atmosphere pervades the Sanur paintings, and are not dictated by the religious iconography.<ref name=\"Spanjaard-Pioneers_of_Balinese_Painting\" /> It is lighter and airy than those of Batuan and Ubud with sea creatures, erotic scenery and wild animals drawn in rhythmic patterns. It is possible that these works, and those of Batuan, influenced the European artist M.C. Escher. Most early works were black and white ink wash on paper, but at the request of Neuhaus, latter works were adorned with light pastel colors often added by a small number of the artists who specialised in coloring black and white drawings, notably I Pica and I Regug, who left their Balinese initials the margins.\n\nThe Sanur school of painting is the most stylized and decorative among all modern Balinese Art. Major artists from Sanur are I Rundu, [[Ida Bagus Nyoman Rai]], Ida [Bagus] Made Pugug, I Soekaria, I [Gusti] Made Rundu, and I Pica. I Rudin, who lived nearby in Renon, started to paint in mid-1930s, and in the 1950s turned to drawing balinese dancers in the manner of the drawings of [[Miguel Covarrubias]].\n\n[[File:Pugur001.jpg|thumb|left| The snake tree, I Wayan Pugur, Gouache on paper]]\n\n=== Young Artist painting ===\nThe development of the Young Artist School of painting is attributed to the Dutch artist [[Arie Smit]], a Dutch soldier who served during the 2nd world war and decided to stay in Bali. In the early 1960s, he came across children in the village of [[Penestanan]] near Tjampuhan drawing on the sand. He encouraged these children to paint by providing them with paper and paints.<ref name=\"JC\" />\n\nTheir paintings are characterized by \"child-like\" drawings that lacks details and bright colors drawn with oil paint on canvas. By the 1970s, it attracted around three hundred peasant painters to produce paintings for tourists. In 1971 Datuk Lim Chong Kit held an exhibition of Young Artists work from his collection, at Alpha Gallery in Singapore entitled [https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/pictures/Details/5aad5799-1073-42f0-b094-3a691e6535d8 ''Peasant Painters of Bali'']. A version of that exhibition was held in 1983 at the National Gallery of [[Malaysia]]..\n\nThe painting by I Wayan Pugur (b. 1945) shown here, was executed when he was 13 years old and was exhibited at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1964, as part of a traveling exhibition in the United States in 1964-1965, which was also exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution. This early drawing, executed on paper, exhibits the use of bright colors and a balanced composition. The drawing space is divided into three solid-color areas: dark blue, bright yellow and magenta in between showing the influence of the Wayang painting tradition. The leaves of the large tree with the snakes show the juxtaposition of complementary colors. The faces of the figures were drawn with no details, yet the snakes have eyes and long tongues.\n\nMajor artists from the Young Artist School are I Wayan Pugur, [[I Ketut Soki]],<ref name=\"Soki\">\n{{cite web\n| last=Soki\n| first=Ketut\n| authorlink=I Ketut Soki\n| title=Pak Soki.

I Ketut Sana learnt to paint from I Gusti Nyoman Sudara Lempad from Ubud and from I Wayan Rajin from Batuan. He combined the line drawing of Lempad and the details of the Batuan school. Every inch of the space is covered with minute details of Balinese village life and legends drawn in ink and colored with watercolor. The outcome is a marriage between the youthfulness of the Ubud school and the details of the Batuan School. The Keliki artists proud with their patience to paint minute details of every objects meticulously that occupy the drawing space.\n\nIllustrated on the left is a drawing by I Lunga (c. 1995) depicting the story of Rajapala. Rajapala is often referred to as the first Balinese voyeur or \u201cpeeping Tom.\u201d According to the story, Rajapala catches sight of a group of celestial nymphs bathing in a pool. He approaches stealthily, and without their knowledge, steals the skirt (kamben) of the prettiest, Sulaish. As her clothing contains magical powers enabling her to fly, the nymph cannot return home. Rajapala offers to marry her. She accepts on the condition that she will return to heaven after the birth of a child. With time, she and Rajapala have a healthy young son. Years pass, and one day, Sulaish accidentally discovers her clothing hidden in the kitchen. Understanding that she has been tricked, she takes leave of her husband and son and goes back to her heavenly abode.\n\nMajor artists from the Keliki Artist School are Sang Ketut Mandera (Dolit),<ref name=\"Dermawan\" /> I Ketut Sana, I Wayan Surana, I Lunga, I Wayan Nengah, I Made Ocen, Gong Juna, I Made Widi, I Wayan Lanus, I Wayan Lodra,<ref name=\"Dermawan\" /> Ida Bagus Putra, Gusti Ngurah Putra Riong and many others.\n\n== Other Schools of Painting ==\n\n===Fingerprint painting===\nA [[Balinese people|Balinese]] of royal descent, I Gusti Ngurah Gede Pemecutan makes his paintings by fingerprints. If we use brush technique, we can brush it off if needed, but the fingerprint technique should placed every dot precisely. His fingerprint paintings have no signature, but have a lot of his fingerprints. The fingerprint painting technique is regarded as part of the [[pointilism]] painting technique (with the brush).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/bali-daily/2012-07-12/i-gusti-ngurah-gede-pemecutan-stamping-a-legacy-with-balinese-fingerprint-pain |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204050057/http://www.thejakartapost.com/bali-daily/2012-07-12/i-gusti-ngurah-gede-pemecutan-stamping-a-legacy-with-balinese-fingerprint-pain |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 4, 2013 |title=I Gusti Ngurah Gede Pemecutan: Stamping a legacy with Balinese fingerprint paintings |date=July 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Wood carving ==\n[[File:BaliLadyDeco.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Woodcarving of an elderly Balinese lady (art deco style), c. 1930s]]\n\nLike the Balinese painting, Balinese wood carving underwent a similar transformation during the 1930s and 1940s. The creative outburst emerged during this transition period is often attributed to western influences. In 2006, an exhibition at the Nusantara Museum, Delft, the Netherlands Leidelmeijer<ref name=\"FL\">Frans Leidermeijer, ''Art Deco beelden van Bali (1930-1970) - van souvenir tot kunstobject'', Waanders, 2006, {{ISBN|90-400-8186-7}}</ref> traced the Art Deco influence on Balinese wood carving. Leidelmeijer further conjectured that the Art Deco influence continued well into the 1970s.\n\nDuring the transition years, the Pitamaha Artist Guild was the prime mover not only for Balinese paintings, but also for the development of modern Balinese wood carvings. I Tagelan (1902-1935) produced an elongated carving of a Balinese woman from a long piece of wood that was given by Walter Spies, who originally requested him to produce two statues.<ref name=\"JC\" /> This carving is in the collection of the Puri Lukisan Museum in Ubud.\n\nOther masters of Balinese modernist woodcarving were: Ida Bagus Nyana, Tjokot (1886-1971)<ref name=\"Eiseman\" /> and Ida Bagus Tilem.\nIda Bagus Nyana was known for experimenting with mass in sculpture. When carving human characters, he shortened some parts of the body and lengthened others, thus bringing an eerie, surreal quality to his work. At the same time he didn't overwork the wood and adopted simple, naive themes of daily life. He thus avoided the \u201cbaroque\u201d trap, unlike many carvers of his day.\n\nTjokot gained a reputation for exploiting the expressive quality inherent in the wood. He would go into the forest to look for strangely shaped trunks and branches and, changing them as little as possible, transforming them into gnarled spooks and demonic figures.<ref name=\"Eiseman\" />\n\nIda Bagus Tilem, the son of Nyana, furthered Nyana and Tjokot's innovations both in his working of the wood and in his choice of themes. Unlike the sculptors from the previous generation, he was daring enough to alter the proportions of the characters depicted in his carving. He allowed the natural deformations in the wood to guide the form of his carving, using gnarled logs well suited for representing twisted human bodies. He saw each deformed log or branch as a medium for expressing human feelings. Instead of depicting myths or scenes of daily life, Tilem took up \u201cabstract\u201d themes with philosophical or psychological content: using distorted pieces of wood that are endowed with strong expressive powers.<ref name=\"Eiseman\" /> Ida Bagus Tilem, however, was not only an artist, but also a teacher. He trained dozens of young sculptors from the area around the village of Mas. He taught them how to select wood for its expressive power, and how to establish dialogue between wood and Man that has become the mainstream of today's Balinese woodcarving.\n\n== Museums holding important Balinese painting collection ==\nThere are many museums throughout the world holding a significant collection of Balinese paintings.<ref name=\"Haks\">\n{{cite book\n| last=Haks\n| first=Frans\n|author2=Kunsthal Rotterdam\n| title=Pre-war Balinese Modernists, 1928-1942\n| publisher=Ars et Animatio\n| year=1999\n| isbn=90-5349-297-6\n}}</ref>\n\n* '''Europe:''' In the Netherlands, the [[Tropenmuseum]] in Amsterdam and the Ethnographic Museum in Leiden, Museum Nusantara in Delft have a large number of paintings from the Wayang period (before the 1920s) and the pre-War period (1920s - 1950s). Notably, the Leiden Ethnographic Museum holds the Rudolf Bonnet and Paul Spies collection. In Switzerland, the Ethnographic Museum in Basel holds the pre-War Batuan and Sanur paintings collected by Schlager and the artist Theo Meier.

They reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s both as composers (under their own names) and as performers (as Oliver Onions), mainly thanks to their [[Film score|scoring]] and [[Theme music|theme song]] composing and performing for action/comedy films starring the popular duo of [[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]], many of which became huge hits all across Europe, both cinematically and musically. After a period of retirement from the music business in the 1990s and early 2000s, during which they moved into television and film production through their own company (named after themselves), they had a musical comeback thanks to a one-off concert event in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], billed as ''Oliver Onions Reunion Live Budapest'' and organized by local promoter G\u00e0bor K\u00f3ves mainly because of the duo's popularity in his homeland, itself due to the fact that Spencer & Hill films were hugely popular in the country during the Communist regime - and, according to Maurizio De Angelis's commentary on the show, still are.<ref name=DeAngelis>{{cite book|author= Maurizio De Angelis |title= \"Oliver Onions Reunion Live Budapest\" CD box set booklet (liner notes)|year= 2017|publisher= Saifam S.r.l.}}</ref> The event, testified by the 2017 release of a double CD/DVD [[box set]], led to a series of other successful shows in Italy and Europe in the following years.\n\n==Beginnings==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe brothers were born in [[Rocca di Papa]], near [[Rome]]; Guido on 22 December 1944 and Maurizio on 22 February 1947. Their musical career started in 1963, when, after successfully releasing an [[LP album|LP]], they became arrangers for [[RCA Italiana]]. Their success led to many more albums in which they composed and arranged the music and sang all the vocals.\n\n==Oliver Onions==\nThe De Angelis brothers were among the most prolific Italian musicians of the 1970s. In fact, they were forced to use different names for many of their projects to avoid over-saturating the market: during their career, they were variously known as G&M Orchestra, Barqueros, Charango, Kathy and Gulliver, Hombres del Mar and Dilly Dilly. However, the name they came to be mostly identified with, and most popular, was suggested by their frequent collaborator and lyricist Susan Duncan-Smith, a British-born journalist who worked in RCA's foreign relationships department. She advised them that, although they did not run any risks in signing their early [[Spaghetti Western]] film score work under their own names (following in the footsteps of the popularity gained by fellow Italian [[Ennio Morricone]] in the same genre), their international credibility as singers of theme songs in English would be undermined if they did not perform under an English-language name. The brothers followed Duncan-Smith's advice and named themselves ''Oliver Onions'' after the [[Oliver Onions|homonymous British writer]]; the name was chosen mostly because it was easy to remember for both English speakers and non-speakers and because the two words are pronounced the same as they are written.<ref name=DeAngelis/>  In Italy, they became best-known for writing and performing the theme song for [[Sergio Sollima]]'s 1976 TV series ''[[Sandokan (TV series)|Sandokan]]'', based on novels by [[Emilio Salgari]], which they also wrote the music score for; the song, heard under the opening credits, became a no.1 hit in the Italian pop charts in the same year. Their soundtrack for the 1981 cartoon series ''Viva i Re Magi'' (previously released in 1979, in Spanish language, in [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]] as ''Vivan los Reyes Magos''), for which they wrote the story and the screenplay as well as the full score and all the songs (which they sang themselves) was also a local hit.\n\nTheir recording \"Santa Maria\" was German number one single for six weeks in 1980 in its original Italian recording It was followed by a German language version by [[Roland Kaiser]], which was number one for another five weeks, see [[List of number-one hits of 1980 (Germany)]]. The Roland Kaiser version was also number one in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n==Film scores==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}\nAlthough they released many standalone albums, it is for their soundtrack work for which the De Angelis brothers are best known. Out of their many scores, which include the main theme for the 1983 Italian [[cult movie]] ''[[Yor, the Hunter from the Future]]'', undoubtedly the most famous and popular are those composed for the Bud Spencer & Terence Hill action/adventure/comedy films, starting with Hill's \"Trinity\" Spaghetti Western trilogy. Most of their theme songs for the comedy duo's films were hits in every country where the films were released, became equally popular as the films themselves and almost synonymous with them. Their song \"Dune Buggy\", for the 1974 film ''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'', topped the European charts.\n\nTheir scores included many cult Italian films such as ''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'', ''[[Torso (1973 film)|Torso]]'', ''[[High Crime]]'', ''[[Milano trema: la polizia vuole giustizia|The Violent Professionals]]'', ''[[Chino (1973 film)|Chino]]'', ''[[Street Law (film)|Street Law]]'', ''[[Violent Rome]]'', ''[[The Big Racket]]'', ''[[Mannaja]]'', ''[[The Mountain of the Cannibal God]]'', ''[[Killer Fish]]'', and ''[[A Blade in the Dark]]''. In 1978, they did an alternate version of the title song for The ''[[Return of the Saint]]'' TV show starring [[Ian Ogilvy]]. Their song \"Taking It Easy\" was used in the European versions of the show, where another version was used in English-speaking countries.\n\nThey are also known for their work on animated series, having composed original songs for Italian-dubbed [[anime]] (such as ''[[Doraemon]]'', ''[[Ashita no Joe]]'' and ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'') and European series (such as ''[[Around the World with Willy Fog]]''). They also composed the music for the cartoon series ''[[Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds]]'' and ''[[Bobobobs]]''.\n\n==Later years: Withdrawal from music and comeback==\n[[File:Oliver onions (cropped).jpg|thumb|Guido & Maurizio De Angelis at [[Lucca]] Comics Festival 2007]]\n\nBy the early 1990s the brothers had become disillusioned with the music business in general and in particular by their almost systematic lack of recognition as professional composers in Italy (although they were mantaining a solid fan base outside of their homeland). As a result of this, they decided to slowly withdraw from music composition and performance in order to move into the more behind-the-scenes, but also more profitable business of production of television series and films. During this period, the duo kept their musical output to the bare minimum, often limiting themselves to scores and soundtracks for their own television and cinematic productions, some of which were mainly composed and arranged by Maurizio (the duo's most musically active member) on his own, with his older brother Guido only providing basic melodic ideas;<ref name=DeAngelis/> they still managed to score sizeable audience hits in the area of production, with long running drama/romantic series such as ''[[Elisa di Rivombrosa]]'' and ''[[Incantesimo]]'' (among several others), broadcast for several seasons respectively by [[Mediaset]] and [[RAI]].\n\nThe first hint of their long-awaited return to music came in November 2007, when they performed their first concert as Oliver Onions in 25 years, at the Lucca Comics Festival. Nine years later, in July 2016, Hungarian music promoter and impresario G\u00e0bor K\u00f3ves asked them to put on an Oliver Onions \"reunion\" and perform their greatest hits live on stage, backed by a rock band and a full orchestra, in an one-off concert event meant both as a celebration of their career and a tribute to their then-recently departed friend Bud Spencer.<ref name=DeAngelis/> According to Maurizio De Angelis's account of the episode in the liner notes for the 2017 audio/video release of the event, K\u00f3ves persuaded them to perform in Budapest by demonstrating to them how popular they still were in Hungary, showing them a large number of fan pages, both on [[Facebook]] and on the Internet in general, created by local fans as a tribute to them and to Spencer & Hill films. Maurizio also admitted that he and Guido were initially very reluctant to perform live, as they had not done so for many years and felt rusty and unprepared; in particular, Guido was utterly terrified at the prospect of singing lead vocals live <ref>During the show, some passages of lead vocals on four tracks were handled by the duo's friend, fellow band member and vocal arranger Alberto \"Zach\" Gigante.</ref>, as he had been almost completely uninvolved in music for a very long time - having engaged himself only in film production. Still, the brothers decided to apply an old Italian proverb (known locally as the \"Bicycle Rule\"), which states that \"Once you have learned how to ride a bicycle, you never forget\". By applying that rule, they came back on their musical feet within one week of intensive studio rehearsals and, once they were actually reunited as musicians, the [[adrenaline]] rush was such that Guido managed to overcome his fears and apply the \"Bicycle Rule\" to himself as well.<ref name=DeAngelis/> The event was hugely successful, both locally and elsewhere. Subsequently, it spawned a series of short but intense tours of Italy and Europe in the following years, all billed as ''Oliver Onions Is Still Our Name'' (parodying the title of [[Trinity Is Still My Name|their 1971 soundtrack for the second Terence Hill \"Trinity\" film]]).

They reached the height of their popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s both as composers (under their own names) and as performers (as Oliver Onions), mainly thanks to their [[Film score|scoring]] and [[Theme music|theme song]] composing and performing for action/comedy films starring the popular duo of [[Bud Spencer]] and [[Terence Hill]], many of which became huge hits all across Europe, both cinematically and musically. After a period of retirement from the music business in the 1990s and early 2000s, during which they moved into television and film production through their own company (named after themselves), they had a musical comeback thanks to a one-off concert event in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], billed as ''Oliver Onions Reunion Live Budapest'' and organized by local promoter G\u00e0bor K\u00f3ves mainly because of the duo's popularity in his homeland, itself due to the fact that Spencer & Hill films were hugely popular in the country during the Communist regime - and, according to Maurizio De Angelis's commentary on the show, still are.<ref name=DeAngelis>{{cite book|author= Maurizio De Angelis |title= \"Oliver Onions Reunion Live Budapest\" CD box set booklet (liner notes)|year= 2017|publisher= Saifam S.r.l.}}</ref> The event, testified by the 2017 release of a double CD/DVD [[box set]], led to a series of other successful shows in Italy and Europe in the following years.\n\n==Beginnings==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}\nThe brothers were born in [[Rocca di Papa]], near [[Rome]]; Guido on 22 December 1944 and Maurizio on 22 February 1947. Their musical career started in 1963, when, after successfully releasing an [[LP album|LP]], they became arrangers for [[RCA Italiana]]. Their success led to many more albums in which they composed and arranged the music and sang all the vocals.\n\n==Oliver Onions==\nThe De Angelis brothers were among the most prolific Italian musicians of the 1970s. In fact, they were forced to use different names for many of their projects to avoid over-saturating the market: during their career, they were variously known as G&M Orchestra, Barqueros, Charango, Kathy and Gulliver, Hombres del Mar and Dilly Dilly. However, the name they came to be mostly identified with, and most popular, was suggested by their frequent collaborator and lyricist Susan Duncan-Smith, a British-born journalist who worked in RCA's foreign relationships department. She advised them that, although they did not run any risks in signing their early [[Spaghetti Western]] film score work under their own names (following in the footsteps of the popularity gained by fellow Italian [[Ennio Morricone]] in the same genre), their international credibility as singers of theme songs in English would be undermined if they did not perform under an English-language name. The brothers followed Duncan-Smith's advice and named themselves ''Oliver Onions'' after the [[Oliver Onions|homonymous British writer]]; the name was chosen mostly because it was easy to remember for both English speakers and non-speakers and because the two words are pronounced the same as they are written.<ref name=DeAngelis/>  In Italy, they became best-known for writing and performing the theme song for [[Sergio Sollima]]'s 1976 TV series ''[[Sandokan (TV series)|Sandokan]]'', based on novels by [[Emilio Salgari]], which they also wrote the music score for; the song, heard under the opening credits, became a no.1 hit in the Italian pop charts in the same year. Their soundtrack for the 1981 cartoon series ''Viva i Re Magi'' (previously released in 1979, in Spanish language, in [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]] as ''Vivan los Reyes Magos''), for which they wrote the story and the screenplay as well as the full score and all the songs (which they sang themselves) was also a local hit.\n\nTheir recording \"Santa Maria\" was German number one single for six weeks in 1980 in its original Italian recording It was followed by a German language version by [[Roland Kaiser]], which was number one for another five weeks, see [[List of number-one hits of 1980 (Germany)]]. The Roland Kaiser version was also number one in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\n==Film scores==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}\nAlthough they released many standalone albums, it is for their soundtrack work for which the De Angelis brothers are best known. Out of their many scores, which include the main theme for the 1983 Italian [[cult movie]] ''[[Yor, the Hunter from the Future]]'', undoubtedly the most famous and popular are those composed for the Bud Spencer & Terence Hill action/adventure/comedy films, starting with Hill's \"Trinity\" Spaghetti Western trilogy. Most of their theme songs for the comedy duo's films were hits in every country where the films were released, became equally popular as the films themselves and almost synonymous with them. Their song \"Dune Buggy\", for the 1974 film ''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'', topped the European charts.\n\nTheir scores included many cult Italian films such as ''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'', ''[[Torso (1973 film)|Torso]]'', ''[[High Crime]]'', ''[[Milano trema: la polizia vuole giustizia|The Violent Professionals]]'', ''[[Chino (1973 film)|Chino]]'', ''[[Street Law (film)|Street Law]]'', ''[[Violent Rome]]'', ''[[The Big Racket]]'', ''[[Mannaja]]'', ''[[The Mountain of the Cannibal God]]'', ''[[Killer Fish]]'', and ''[[A Blade in the Dark]]''. In 1978, they did an alternate version of the title song for The ''[[Return of the Saint]]'' TV show starring [[Ian Ogilvy]]. Their song \"Taking It Easy\" was used in the European versions of the show, where another version was used in English-speaking countries.\n\nThey are also known for their work on animated series, having composed original songs for Italian-dubbed [[anime]] (such as ''[[Doraemon]]'', ''[[Ashita no Joe]]'' and ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'') and European series (such as ''[[Around the World with Willy Fog]]''). They also composed the music for the cartoon series ''[[Dogtanian and the Three Muskehounds]]'' and ''[[Bobobobs]]''.\n\n==Later years: Withdrawal from music and comeback==\n[[File:Oliver onions (cropped).jpg|thumb|Guido & Maurizio De Angelis at [[Lucca]] Comics Festival 2007]]\nBy the early 1990s the brothers had become disillusioned with the music business in general and in particular by their almost systematic lack of recognition as professional composers in Italy (although they were mantaining a solid fan base outside of their homeland). As a result of this, they decided to slowly withdraw from music composition and performance in order to move into the more behind-the-scenes, but also more profitable business of production of television series and films. During this period, the duo kept their musical output to the bare minimum, often limiting themselves to scores and soundtracks for their own television and cinematic productions, some of which were mainly composed and arranged by Maurizio (the duo's most musically active member) on his own, with his older brother Guido only providing basic melodic ideas;<ref name=DeAngelis/> they still managed to score sizeable audience hits in the area of production, with long running drama/romantic series such as ''[[Elisa di Rivombrosa]]'' and ''[[Incantesimo]]'' (among several others), broadcast for several seasons respectively by [[Mediaset]] and [[RAI]].\n\nThe first hint of their long-awaited return to music came in November 2007, when they performed their first concert as Oliver Onions in 25 years, at the Lucca Comics Festival. Nine years later, in July 2016, Hungarian music promoter and impresario G\u00e0bor K\u00f3ves asked them to put on an Oliver Onions \"reunion\" and perform their greatest hits live on stage, backed by a rock band and a full orchestra, in an one-off concert event meant both as a celebration of their career and a tribute to their then-recently departed friend Bud Spencer.<ref name=DeAngelis/> According to Maurizio De Angelis's account of the episode in the liner notes for the 2017 audio/video release of the event, K\u00f3ves persuaded them to perform in Budapest by demostrating them how popular they still were in Hungary, showing them a large number of fan pages, both on [[Facebook]] and on the Internet in general, created by local fans as a tribute to them and to Spencer & Hill films. Maurizio also admitted that he and Guido were initially very reluctant to perform live, as they had not done so for many years and felt rusty and unprepared; in particular, Guido was utterly terrified at the prospect of singing lead vocals live <ref>During the show, some passages of lead vocals on four tracks were handled by the duo's friend, fellow band member and vocal arranger Alberto \"Zach\" Gigante.</ref>, as he had been almost completely uninvolved in music for a very long time - having engaged himself only in film production. Still, the brothers decided to apply an old Italian proverb (known locally as the \"Bicycle Rule\"), which states that \"Once you have learned how to ride a bicycle, you never forget\". By applying that rule, they came back on their musical feet within one week of intensive studio rehearsals and, once they were actually reunited as musicians, the [[adrenaline]] rush was such that Guido managed to overcome his fears and apply the \"Bicycle Rule\" to himself as well.<ref name=DeAngelis/> The event was hugely successful, both locally and elsewhere. Subsequently, it spawned a series of short but intense tours of Italy and Europe in the following years, all billed as ''Oliver Onions Is Still Our Name'' (parodying the title of [[Trinity Is Still My Name|their 1971 soundtrack for the second Terence Hill \"Trinity\" film]]). Their latest such tour ended on 30 October 2019 at Lucca Comics and Games<ref>[https://www.oliveronions.it/ Oliver Onions official website]</ref> and it is scheduled to restart in spring 2020.\n\nTheir theme for ''[[Zorro (1975 Italian film)|Zorro]]'' (1975), \"Zorro Is Back\", was featured in [[Wes Anderson]]'s ''[[Bottle Rocket]]'', and their song \"Goodbye My Friend\" (from the movie [[Street Law (film)|''Street Law'']]) featured on the soundtrack to ''[[Faster (2010 film)|Faster]]''.\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[Trinity Is Still My Name]]'' (1971)\n*''[[Man of the East]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Sting of the West|Father Jackleg]]'' (1972)\n*''[[All the Way, Boys]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Torso (1973 film)|Torso]]'' (1973)\n*''[[High Crime]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Milano trema: la polizia vuole giustizia|The Violent Professionals]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Giovannona Long-Thigh]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Chino (1973 film)|Chino]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Even Angels Eat Beans]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Flatfoot (film)|Flatfoot]]'' (1973)\n*''[[Street Law (film)|Street Law]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Two Missionaries]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Run, Run, Joe!]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Piedone a Hong Kong|Flatfoot in Hong Kong]]'' (1975)\n*''[[The School Teacher]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Zorro (1975 Italian film)|Zorro]]'' (1975)\n*''[[The White, the Yellow, and the Black|Shoot First...

{"title_page": "Stack machine", "text_new": "{{For|stack machines in automata theory|Pushdown automaton}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Essay-like|date=August 2011}}\n{{Original research|section|date=February 2016}}}}\nIn [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]] and [[programming language implementation]]s, a '''stack machine''' is a type of computer. In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.\n\nThe main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a [[stack (data structure)|pushdown stack]] of numbers rather than numbers held in [[processor registers]]. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location (the top of the stack), the instructions themselves do not require [[memory address]]es or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) style known as a '''zero address format'''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Bob |last=Beard  |magazine= Computer RESURRECTION |date= Autumn 1997 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c |title=The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On}}</ref>\n\nStacks are not unique to stack machines; most [[programming language]]s make extensive use of stacks to support [[subroutine]]s and [[method call]]s. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in [[high level language]]s. This has led to a number of [[central processor unit]] designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional [[register machine]] systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Practical expression-stack machines==\nA \"stack machine\" is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.\n\nFor a typical instruction such as {{code|Add}} the computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the sum, which the computer calculates when it performs the {{code|Add}} instruction.  The instruction's operands are \"popped\" off the stack, and its result(s) are then \"pushed\" back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.   Most stack instructions have only an [[opcode]] commanding an operation, with no additional fields to identify a constant, register or memory cell.  The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a richer set of operations can be computed.  Integer constant operands are often pushed by separate {{code|Load Immediate}} instructions.  Memory is often accessed by separate {{code|Load}} or {{code|Store}} instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack.\n\nFor speed, a stack machine often implements some part of its stack with registers. To execute quickly, operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) may be the top two registers of the stack and the result from the ALU is stored in the top register of the stack.  Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM accessed by a \"top of stack\" address register. This is slower, but the number of flip-flops is less, making a less-expensive, more compact CPU.  Its topmost N values may be [[Cache (computing)|cached]] for speed. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them.\n\nThe [[instruction set]] carries out most ALU actions with postfix ([[reverse Polish notation]]) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.\n\nIn contrast, [[register machine]]s hold temporary values in a small, fast array of [[Processor register|register]]s.  [[Accumulator machine]]s have only one general-purpose register.  [[Belt machine]]s use a FIFO queue to hold temporary values.  Memory-to-memory machines do not have any temporary registers usable by a programmer.\n\nStack machines may have their expression stack and their [[call stack|call-return stack]] separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]] with fewer interactions and less design complexity. Usually it can run faster.\n\nSome technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys.  This is a form of stack machine.  The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.\n\n===Advantages of stack machine instruction sets===\n====Very compact object code====\nIn stack machine code, the most frequent instructions consist of just an opcode selecting the operation.  This can easily fit in 6 bits or less.  Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits.  The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions.  In contrast, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction.\n\nThe instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields.  Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values.  These temporary locations require extra memory reference instructions which take more code space than for the stack machine, or even compact register machines.\n\nAll practical stack machines have variants of the load\u2013store opcodes for accessing [[local variable]]s and [[formal parameter]]s without explicit address calculations.  This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.  Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.\n\n[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very expensive and very limited even on mainframes. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.\n\nSome of the density of [[Burroughs large systems#B6500|Burroughs B6700]] code was due to moving vital operand information elsewhere, to 'tags' on every data word or into tables of pointers.  The Add instruction itself was generic or polymorphic.  It had to fetch the operand to discover whether this was an integer add or floating point add.  The Load instruction could find itself tripping on an [[Addressing mode|indirect address]], or worse, a disguised call to a [[call-by-name]] [[thunk]] routine.  The generic opcodes required fewer opcode bits but made the hardware more like an interpreter, with less opportunity to pipeline the common cases.\n\n====Simple compilers====\nCompilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines.  Code generation is trivial and independent of prior or subsequent code. The picture shows the syntax tree corresponding to the example expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'')+(''D''+''E'').\n\n[[File:AST binary tree arith variables.svg|thumb|Binary syntax tree for the expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'') + (''D''+''E'')]]\n\nThe compiled code for a simple stack machine would take the form (corresponding to the expressions' reverse Polish notation ''A'' ''B'' ''C'' - * ''D'' ''E'' + +):\n\n                  # stack contents (leftmost = top):\n  push A          #           A\n  push B          #     B     A\n  push C          # C   B     A\n  subtract        #     B-C   A\n  multiply        #           A*(B-C)\n  push D          #     D     A*(B-C)\n  push E          # E   D     A*(B-C)\n  add             #     D+E   A*(B-C)\n  add             #           A*(B-C)+(D+E)\n\nThe arithmetic operations 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'add' act on the two topmost operands of the stack.\n\nSuch simple compilation can be done by the parsing pass.  No register management is needed. Most stack machines can copy stack entries to avoid memory access (which is much slower), but these are usually trivial.  The same opcode that handles the frequent common case of an add, an indexed load, or a function call will also handle the general case involving complex subexpressions and nested calls. The compiler and the CPU do not need special cases for instructions that have separate calculation paths for addresses.\n\nThis simplicity has allowed compilers to fit onto very small machines.  The simple compilers allowed new product lines to get to market quickly, and allowed new operating systems to be written entirely in a high level language rather than in assembly.  For example, the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine rather than to the actual hardware.\n\nThe downside to the simplicity of compilers for stack machines, is that pure stack machines have fewer optimisations (see subsections in [[#Performance disadvantages of stack machines|\u00a7 performance disadvantages of stack machines]]). However optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Philip|title=A Preliminary Exploration of Optimized Stack Code Generation|journal=Journal of Forth applications and Research|year=1994|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_compiler/stack_co.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Chris|title=Inter-Boundary Scheduling of Stack Operands: A preliminary Study|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth 2000 Conference|year=2000|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef00/bailey00.pdf}}</ref> and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Mark|author2=Bailey C |title=Global Stack Allocation : Register Allocation for Stack Machines|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth Conference 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth2006/papers/shannon.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Simple interpreters====\nSome stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.  Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register or memory-to-memory machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions.  Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup.  (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)\n\n====Fast operand access====\nSince there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine.<ref name=\"koopman89\" /> In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage. For example, in the [[Java Optimized Processor]] (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/stack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Design and Implementation of an Efficient Stack Machine|website=Jopdesign.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====Avoids data passing through memory, faster interpreters=====\nFast access is also useful for interpreters. Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.\n\n====Minimal processor state====\nA machine with an expression stack can get by with just two registers that are visible to a programmer: The top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.  The minimal hardware implementation has far fewer bits of flipflops or registers.  Faster designs can simply buffer the topmost N stack cells into registers to reduce memory stack cycles.\n\nResponding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code.  In a stack machine, most parameters are already on a stack.  Therefore, there is no need to push them there.  Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts.  Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped<ref>8051 CPU Manual, Intel, 1980</ref> but this increases costs and slows down the register file.\n\n===Performance disadvantages of stack machines===\n====More memory references====\nSome in the industry believe that stack machines execute more [[data cache]] cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.<ref>\"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\", John L Hennessy, David A Patterson; See the discussion of stack machines.</ref>\n\nOn stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers.  (However, these values often need to be spilled into \"activation frames\" at the end of a procedure's definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing).  Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles.  This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.\n\nSome simple stack machines or stack interpreters use no top-of-stack hardware registers.  Those minimal implementations are always slower than standard register machines.  A typical expression such as {{code|X+1}} compiles to {{code|Load X}}; {{code|Load 1}}; {{code|Add}}.  This does implicit writes and reads of the memory stack which were not needed:\n* Load X, push to memory\n* Load 1, push to memory\n* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory\nfor a total of 5 data cache references.\n\nThe next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register.  The above code then does:\n* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine), or\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register\n* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there\nfor a total of 5 data cache references, worst-case.  Generally, interpreters don't track emptiness, because they don't have to\u2014anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot.  Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.\n\nIf the hardwired stack machine has N registers to cache the topmost memory stack words, then all spills and refills are avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle, the same as for a register or accumulator machine.\n\nOn register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells.  This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values.  The development of \"stack scheduling\" for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.\n\nOn the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls.  The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls.  This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.\n\n====High cost of factoring out common subexpressions====\nIn register machines, a [[common subexpression]] (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.\n\nWith stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as {{code|X+1}}. These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in non-concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.\n\nThe second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU's available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines.<ref name=\"koopman89\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/|title=Stack Computers: the new wave -- an on-line book|website=Ece.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fpgacpu.ca/stack/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Second-Generation Stack Computer Architecture|website=Fpgacpu.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112702/http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }} </ref> Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal \"stack scheduling\" are not in wide use by programming languages.\n\n====Rigid code order====\nIn modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations.  A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable.  Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and \"out-of-order execution\" that examines and runs many instructions at once.  Register machines can even do this with much simpler \"in-order\" hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence.  The compiler puts independent steps in between.\n\nScheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers.  It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer.  For the expression A-B, the right operand must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step.  Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish.  Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233311/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-21 }} </ref>  Today's increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it's been made out to be in the past.\n\n=====Able to use out-of-order execution=====\nThe [[Tomasulo algorithm]] finds [[instruction-level parallelism]] by issuing instructions as their data becomes available.  Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file.  This view permits the [[out-of-order execution]] of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.\n\nOut-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.<ref name=\"boost\">{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Satrajit|last2=Ravindran|first2=Kaushik|title=BOOST: Berkeley's Out of Order Stack Thingie|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228556746_BOOST_Berkeley's_Out-of-Order_Stack_Thingy|website=Research Gate|publisher=Kaushik Ravindran|accessdate=16 February 2016|ref=boost}}</ref> The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack.  The result achieves throughput (instructions per [[Clock rate|clock]]) comparable to [[RISC]] register machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).\n\nA stack machine's compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better [[CPU cache|cache]] efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instruction is very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.\n\nOne issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of a register machine's RISC instruction.\nCompetitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions (\"issue stations\"). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.\n\n====Hides a faster register machine inside====\nSome simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers.  The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.\n\nHowever, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses.  The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact.  But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.\n\n[[Microcode|Microprogrammed]] stack machines are an example of this.  The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a [[VLIW]]-like machine using multiple register files.  When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.\n\nThe object code translators for the [[HP 3000]] and [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] T/16 are another example.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HP3000 Emulation on HP Precision Architecture Computers|author1=Arndt Bergh|author2=Keith Keilman|author3=Daniel Magenheimer|author4=James Miller|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=December 1987|pages=87-89|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1987-12.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Migrating a CISC Computer Family onto RISC via Object Code Translation, K. Andrews and D. Sand, Proceedings of ASPLOS-V, October, 1992</ref>\nThey translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code.  Minor 'local' optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture.  Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations.  The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code.  And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled.  This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.\n\nRegister files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches.  In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency.  Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles.  That's one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay.  In a complex machine like [[Athlon]] that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency.  Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency.  Again, that's one third of the throughput of registers.  It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.\n\n====More instructions, slower interpreters====\nInterpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Virtual Machine Showdown: Stack vs. Register Machine\"|author1=Yunhe Shi|author2=David Gregg|author3=Andrew Beatty|author4=M.

Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value.  The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.\n\nIn some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is [[threaded code]]. The host machine's prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump.  So the host machine's execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction.  This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Case for Virtual Register Machines'|author1=Brian Davis|author2=Andrew Beatty|author3=Kevin Casey|author4=David Gregg|author5=John Waldron|url=http://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/papers/Gregg-SoCP-2005.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scss.tcd.ie|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAndroid's [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine for Java uses a virtual-register 16-bit instruction set instead of Java's usual 8-bit stack code, to minimize instruction count and opcode dispatch stalls.

The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.\n\nAnother common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: 'memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ'. This was first used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[PDP-11]] minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in [[VAX]] computers and in [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Motorola 68000|M68000]] microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or [[threaded code]]. However, this feature did not help the register machine's own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.\n\nMore recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called \"A\", while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.\n\nThe Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its [[x87]], [[Intel 8087]] floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8 deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.\n\n===Commercial stack machines===\n{{see also|High-level language computer architecture}}\nExamples of stack instruction sets directly executed in hardware include\n* The F18A architecture of the 144-processor GA144 chip from GreenArrays, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.html#architecture,|title=GreenArrays, Inc. - Documents|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorforth.com/inst.htm#colorForth,|title=\"Instruction set of the F18A cores (named  colorForth for historical reasons).\"|website=Colorforth.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/|title=\"GreenArrays, Inc.\"|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n* the [[Burroughs large systems]] architecture (since 1961)\n* the [[Xerox Daybreak | Xerox Dandelion]] introduced April 27, 1981, utilized a stack machine architecture to save memory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa Processor Principles of Operation |url=http://www.digibarn.com/friends/alanfreier/princops/00yTableOfContents.html |website=DigiBarn Computer Museum |publisher=Xerox |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DigiBarn: The Xerox Star 8010 \"Dandelion\" |url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html |publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n* the [[English Electric KDF9]] machine.

Each nested call creates a new '''stack frame''' in memory, which persists until that call completes.  This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions.  Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes.  Or it may be something in between.\n\nSince this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines.  That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.\n\nComputers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program's global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame.  'Up level' addressing of the contents of callers' stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware.  If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.\n\nSome Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special 'display' register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes.  No subsequent computer lines have done this in hardware.  When [[Niklaus Wirth]] developed the first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compiler for the [[CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000]], he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers.  This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.\n\nThe same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads.  The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator's subsequent frames nor the task's own frames.  This was supported by a [[Parent pointer tree|cactus stack]], whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a [[Saguaro]] cactus.  Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns.  The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator's stack.  In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.\n\nIn some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time.  These languages organize their procedure 'activation records' as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.\n\nIn simple languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead.  So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames.  The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Belt machine]]\n* [[Stack-oriented programming language]]\n* [[Concatenative programming language]]\n* [[Comparison of application virtual machines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/ ''Stack Computers: the new wave'' book by Philip J.

In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine.\n\nThe main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a [[stack (data structure)|pushdown stack]] of numbers rather than numbers held in [[processor registers]]. Because the operands used in the instructions are always in a known location (at the top of the stack), the instructions themselves do not require [[memory address]]es or register numbers to supply their operands. This leads to an [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) style known as a '''zero address format'''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first= Bob |last=Beard  |magazine= Computer RESURRECTION |date= Autumn 1997 |url=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res18.htm#c |title=The KDF9 Computer - 30 Years On}}</ref>\n\nStacks are not unique to stack machines; most [[programming language]]s make extensive use of stacks to support [[subroutine]]s and [[method call]]s. For this reason, stack machines more closely mimic the inner workings of the programs that run on them, assuming the programs are written in [[high level language]]s. This has led to a number of [[central processor unit]] designs that implement stack machines in order to provide higher performance. In practice, however, these designs have been outperformed by the traditional [[register machine]] systems, and have remained a niche player in the market.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Practical expression-stack machines==\nA \"stack machine\" is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.\n\nFor a typical instruction such as {{code|Add}} the computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the sum, which the computer calculates when it performs the {{code|Add}} instruction.  The instruction's operands are \"popped\" off the stack, and its result(s) are then \"pushed\" back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.   Most stack instructions have only an [[opcode]] commanding an operation, with no additional fields to identify a constant, register or memory cell.  The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a richer set of operations can be computed.  Integer constant operands are often pushed by separate {{code|Load Immediate}} instructions.  Memory is often accessed by separate {{code|Load}} or {{code|Store}} instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack.\n\nFor speed, a stack machine often implements some part of its stack with registers. To execute quickly, operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) may be the top two registers of the stack and the result from the ALU is stored in the top register of the stack.  Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM accessed by a \"top of stack\" address register. This is slower, but the number of flip-flops is less, making a less-expensive, more compact CPU.  Its topmost N values may be [[Cache (computing)|cached]] for speed. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them.\n\nThe [[instruction set]] carries out most ALU actions with postfix ([[reverse Polish notation]]) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.\n\nIn contrast, [[register machine]]s hold temporary values in a small, fast array of [[Processor register|register]]s.  [[Accumulator machine]]s have only one general-purpose register.  [[Belt machine]]s use a FIFO queue to hold temporary values.  Memory-to-memory machines do not have any temporary registers usable by a programmer.\n\nStack machines may have their expression stack and their [[call stack|call-return stack]] separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]] with fewer interactions and less design complexity. Usually it can run faster.\n\nSome technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys.  This is a form of stack machine.  The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.\n\n===Advantages of stack machine instruction sets===\n====Very compact object code====\nIn stack machine code, the most frequent instructions consist of just an opcode selecting the operation.  This can easily fit in 6 bits or less.  Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits.  The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions.  In contrast, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction.\n\nThe instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields.  Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values.  These temporary locations require extra memory reference instructions which take more code space than for the stack machine, or even compact register machines.\n\nAll practical stack machines have variants of the load\u2013store opcodes for accessing [[local variable]]s and [[formal parameter]]s without explicit address calculations.  This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.  Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.\n\n[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very expensive and very limited even on mainframes. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.\n\nSome of the density of [[Burroughs large systems#B6500|Burroughs B6700]] code was due to moving vital operand information elsewhere, to 'tags' on every data word or into tables of pointers.  The Add instruction itself was generic or polymorphic.  It had to fetch the operand to discover whether this was an integer add or floating point add.  The Load instruction could find itself tripping on an [[Addressing mode|indirect address]], or worse, a disguised call to a [[call-by-name]] [[thunk]] routine.  The generic opcodes required fewer opcode bits but made the hardware more like an interpreter, with less opportunity to pipeline the common cases.\n\n====Simple compilers====\nCompilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines.  Code generation is trivial and independent of prior or subsequent code. The picture shows the syntax tree corresponding to the example expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'')+(''D''+''E'').\n\n[[File:AST binary tree arith variables.svg|thumb|Binary syntax tree for the expression ''A''*(''B''-''C'') + (''D''+''E'')]]\n\nThe compiled code for a simple stack machine would take the form (corresponding to the expressions' reverse Polish notation ''A'' ''B'' ''C'' - * ''D'' ''E'' + +):\n\n                  # stack contents (leftmost = top):\n  push A          #           A\n  push B          #     B     A\n  push C          # C   B     A\n  subtract        #     B-C   A\n  multiply        #           A*(B-C)\n  push D          #     D     A*(B-C)\n  push E          # E   D     A*(B-C)\n  add             #     D+E   A*(B-C)\n  add             #           A*(B-C)+(D+E)\n\nThe arithmetic operations 'subtract', 'multiply', and 'add' act on the two topmost operands of the stack.\n\nSuch simple compilation can be done by the parsing pass.  No register management is needed. Most stack machines can copy stack entries to avoid memory access (which is much slower), but these are usually trivial.  The same opcode that handles the frequent common case of an add, an indexed load, or a function call will also handle the general case involving complex subexpressions and nested calls. The compiler and the CPU do not need special cases for instructions that have separate calculation paths for addresses.\n\nThis simplicity has allowed compilers to fit onto very small machines.  The simple compilers allowed new product lines to get to market quickly, and allowed new operating systems to be written entirely in a high level language rather than in assembly.  For example, the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine rather than to the actual hardware.\n\nThe downside to the simplicity of compilers for stack machines, is that pure stack machines have fewer optimisations (see subsections in [[#Performance disadvantages of stack machines|\u00a7 performance disadvantages of stack machines]]). However optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Philip|title=A Preliminary Exploration of Optimized Stack Code Generation|journal=Journal of Forth applications and Research|year=1994|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_compiler/stack_co.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Chris|title=Inter-Boundary Scheduling of Stack Operands: A preliminary Study|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth 2000 Conference|year=2000|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef00/bailey00.pdf}}</ref> and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Mark|author2=Bailey C |title=Global Stack Allocation : Register Allocation for Stack Machines|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth Conference 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth2006/papers/shannon.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Simple interpreters====\nSome stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.  Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register or memory-to-memory machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions.  Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup.  (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)\n\n====Fast operand access====\nSince there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine.<ref name=\"koopman89\" /> In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage. For example, in the [[Java Optimized Processor]] (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/stack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Design and Implementation of an Efficient Stack Machine|website=Jopdesign.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=====Avoids data passing through memory, faster interpreters=====\nFast access is also useful for interpreters. Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.\n\n====Minimal processor state====\nA machine with an expression stack can get by with just two registers that are visible to a programmer: The top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.  The minimal hardware implementation has far fewer bits of flipflops or registers.  Faster designs can simply buffer the topmost N stack cells into registers to reduce memory stack cycles.\n\nResponding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code.  In a stack machine, most parameters are already on a stack.  Therefore, there is no need to push them there.  Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts.  Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped<ref>8051 CPU Manual, Intel, 1980</ref> but this increases costs and slows down the register file.\n\n===Performance disadvantages of stack machines===\n====More memory references====\nSome in the industry believe that stack machines execute more [[data cache]] cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.<ref>\"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach\", John L Hennessy, David A Patterson; See the discussion of stack machines.</ref>\n\nOn stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers.  (However, these values often need to be spilled into \"activation frames\" at the end of a procedure's definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing).  Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles.  This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.\n\nSome simple stack machines or stack interpreters use no top-of-stack hardware registers.  Those minimal implementations are always slower than standard register machines.  A typical expression such as {{code|X+1}} compiles to {{code|Load X}}; {{code|Load 1}}; {{code|Add}}.  This does implicit writes and reads of the memory stack which were not needed:\n* Load X, push to memory\n* Load 1, push to memory\n* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory\nfor a total of 5 data cache references.\n\nThe next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register.  The above code then does:\n* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine), or\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)\n* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register\n* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there\nfor a total of 5 data cache references, worst-case.  Generally, interpreters don't track emptiness, because they don't have to\u2014anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot.  Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.\n\nIf the hardwired stack machine has N registers to cache the topmost memory stack words, then all spills and refills are avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle, the same as for a register or accumulator machine.\n\nOn register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells.  This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values.  The development of \"stack scheduling\" for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.\n\nOn the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls.  The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls.  This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.\n\n====High cost of factoring out common subexpressions====\nIn register machines, a [[common subexpression]] (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.\n\nWith stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as {{code|X+1}}. These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in non-concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.\n\nThe second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU's available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines.<ref name=\"koopman89\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/|title=Stack Computers: the new wave -- an on-line book|website=Ece.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fpgacpu.ca/stack/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Second-Generation Stack Computer Architecture|website=Fpgacpu.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112702/http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 }} </ref> Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal \"stack scheduling\" are not in wide use by programming languages.\n\n====Rigid code order====\nIn modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations.  A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable.  Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and \"out-of-order execution\" that examines and runs many instructions at once.  Register machines can even do this with much simpler \"in-order\" hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence.  The compiler puts independent steps in between.\n\nScheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers.  It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer.  For the expression A-B, the right operand must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step.  Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish.  Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233311/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-21 }} </ref>  Today's increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it's been made out to be in the past.\n\n=====Able to use out-of-order execution=====\nThe [[Tomasulo algorithm]] finds [[instruction-level parallelism]] by issuing instructions as their data becomes available.  Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file.  This view permits the [[out-of-order execution]] of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.\n\nOut-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.<ref name=\"boost\">{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Satrajit|last2=Ravindran|first2=Kaushik|title=BOOST: Berkeley's Out of Order Stack Thingie|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228556746_BOOST_Berkeley's_Out-of-Order_Stack_Thingy|website=Research Gate|publisher=Kaushik Ravindran|accessdate=16 February 2016|ref=boost}}</ref> The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack.  The result achieves throughput (instructions per [[Clock rate|clock]]) comparable to [[RISC]] register machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).\n\nA stack machine's compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better [[CPU cache|cache]] efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instruction is very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.\n\nOne issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of a register machine's RISC instruction.\nCompetitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions (\"issue stations\"). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.\n\n====Hides a faster register machine inside====\nSome simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers.  The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.\n\nHowever, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses.  The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact.  But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.\n\n[[Microcode|Microprogrammed]] stack machines are an example of this.  The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a [[VLIW]]-like machine using multiple register files.  When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.\n\nThe object code translators for the [[HP 3000]] and [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] T/16 are another example.<ref>{{cite journal|title=HP3000 Emulation on HP Precision Architecture Computers|author1=Arndt Bergh|author2=Keith Keilman|author3=Daniel Magenheimer|author4=James Miller|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=December 1987|pages=87-89|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1987-12.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>Migrating a CISC Computer Family onto RISC via Object Code Translation, K. Andrews and D. Sand, Proceedings of ASPLOS-V, October, 1992</ref>\nThey translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code.  Minor 'local' optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture.  Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations.  The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code.  And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled.  This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.\n\nRegister files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches.  In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency.  Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles.  That's one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay.  In a complex machine like [[Athlon]] that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency.  Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency.  Again, that's one third of the throughput of registers.  It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.\n\n====More instructions, slower interpreters====\nInterpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Virtual Machine Showdown: Stack vs. Register Machine\"|author1=Yunhe Shi|author2=David Gregg|author3=Andrew Beatty|author4=M. Anton Ertle|url=http://usenix.org/events/vee05/full_papers/p153-yunhe.pdf|format=PDF|website=Usenix.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> This slowdown is worst when running on host machines with deep execution pipelines, such as current x86 chips.\n\nA program has to execute more instructions when compiled to a stack machine than when compiled to a register machine or memory-to-memory machine.  Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value.  The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.\n\nIn some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is [[threaded code]]. The host machine's prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump.  So the host machine's execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction.  This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.<ref>{{cite web|title='The Case for Virtual Register Machines'|author1=Brian Davis|author2=Andrew Beatty|author3=Kevin Casey|author4=David Gregg|author5=John Waldron|url=http://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/papers/Gregg-SoCP-2005.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scss.tcd.ie|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nAndroid's [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine for Java uses a virtual-register 16-bit instruction set instead of Java's usual 8-bit stack code, to minimize instruction count and opcode dispatch stalls.  Arithmetic instructions directly fetch or store local variables via 4-bit (or larger) instruction fields.  Version 5.0 of Lua replaced its virtual stack machine with a faster virtual register machine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Implementation of Lua 5.0|website=Lua.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/talks/lua-ll3.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Virtual Machine of Lua 5.0|website=Inf.puc-rio.br|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince Java virtual machine became popular, microprocessors have employed advanced [[branch predictor]]s for indirect jumps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01100647/document|title=Branch Prediction and the Performance of Interpreters - Don\u2019t Trust Folklore|website=Hal.inria.fr|accessdate=8 October 2017}} </ref> This advance avoids most of pipeline restarts from N-way jumps and eliminates much of the instruction count costs that affect stack interpreters.\n\n===Hybrid machines===\n(These should not be confused with [[hybrid computer]]s that combine both digital and analogue features, e.g. an otherwise digital computer that accesses analogue multiplication or differential equation solving by memory mapping and conversion to and from an analogue device's inputs and outputs.)\n\nPure stack machines are quite inefficient for procedures which access multiple fields from the same object. The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.\n\nAnother common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: 'memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ'. This was first used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[PDP-11]] minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in [[VAX]] computers and in [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Motorola 68000|M68000]] microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or [[threaded code]]. However, this feature did not help the register machine's own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.\n\nMore recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called \"A\", while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.\n\nThe Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its [[x87]], [[Intel 8087]] floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8 deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.\n\n===Commercial stack machines===\n{{see also|High-level language computer architecture}}\nExamples of stack instruction sets directly executed in hardware include\n* The F18A architecture of the 144-processor GA144 chip from GreenArrays, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/home/documents/index.html#architecture,|title=GreenArrays, Inc. - Documents|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorforth.com/inst.htm#colorForth,|title=\"Instruction set of the F18A cores (named  colorForth for historical reasons).\"|website=Colorforth.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenarraychips.com/|title=\"GreenArrays, Inc.\"|website=Greenarraychips.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n* the [[Burroughs large systems]] architecture (since 1961)\n* the [[Xerox Daybreak | Xerox Dandelion]] introduced April 27, 1981, utilized a stack machine architecture to save memory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mesa Processor Principles of Operation |url=http://www.digibarn.com/friends/alanfreier/princops/00yTableOfContents.html |website=DigiBarn Computer Museum |publisher=Xerox |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DigiBarn: The Xerox Star 8010 \"Dandelion\" |url=http://www.digibarn.com/collections/systems/xerox-8010/index.html |publisher=DigiBarn Computer Museum |accessdate=23 December 2019}}</ref>\n* the [[English Electric KDF9]] machine.

Each nested call creates a new '''stack frame''' in memory, which persists until that call completes.  This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions.  Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes.  Or it may be something in between.\n\nSince this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines.  That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.\n\nComputers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program's global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame.  'Up level' addressing of the contents of callers' stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware.  If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.\n\nSome Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special 'display' register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes.  No subsequent computer lines have done this in hardware.  When [[Niklaus Wirth]] developed the first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compiler for the [[CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000]], he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers.  This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.\n\nThe same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads.  The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator's subsequent frames nor the task's own frames.  This was supported by a [[Parent pointer tree|cactus stack]], whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a [[Saguaro]] cactus.  Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns.  The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator's stack.  In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.\n\nIn some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time.  These languages organize their procedure 'activation records' as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.\n\nIn simple languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead.  So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames.  The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Belt machine]]\n* [[Stack-oriented programming language]]\n* [[Concatenative programming language]]\n* [[Comparison of application virtual machines]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/ ''Stack Computers: the new wave'' book by Philip J.

WKST is home to New Castle High School basketball and football broadcasts.  The station currently has one local talk show, which is hosted by longtime employee and Youngstown, Ohio resident Ken Hlebovy.  News coverage is provided by New Castle resident Wade Sutton.\n\n==History==\nWKST has been broadcasting in New Castle for over 70 years, but prior to November 5, 1999 it was at 1280&nbsp;kHz.  WKST signed on the air in 1938.  In the 1940s it was a Mutual affiliate.  In 1942 [[Alan Freed]] landed his first broadcasting job at WKST, before moving on to nearby [[WKBN (AM)|WKBN]] [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]], followed by [[WAKR]] [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and then [[WKNR|WJW]] [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] &mdash; the station where Freed is credited with first using and popularizing the term \"[[rock and roll]]\" to describe the music genre.  By the 1970s WKST was owned by Faye and Herb Scott, formerly based in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]], and held in the name of Great Scott Broadcasting.  Great Scott purchased FM station WFEM in [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania|Ellwood City]], and it became WKST-FM on January 1, 1988.  In the late 1990s, after the death of the Scotts, Great Scott decided to concentrate on its radio holdings in Delaware, and it sold WKST and WKST-FM to Jacor for $2.5 million in December 1998.\n\nPrior to November 5, 1999, the 1200&nbsp;kHz frequency was occupied by WBZY.  WBZY began broadcasting in 1968.  In December 1986 WBZY was sold by Lawrence County Broadcasting Corp. to a partnership called WBZY Radio Sam (the \"Sam\" representing the surname initials of partners Samuel M. Shirey, William G. Andrews and Robert L. McCracken).  Andrews sold his share to the other two partners in 1991. WBZY was then sold to Jacor in April 1999<ref>[http://newradiostar.com/NEWS/newsaprilmay1999.htm Newradiostar.com. April-May 1999 news.]</ref> for $800,000, and Jacor was purchased by [[Clear Channel Communications]] shortly thereafter.

It is currently owned by Forever Broadcasting, LLC of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] which also owns 12 other radio stations in Pennsylvania including [[WUZZ (AM)|WUZZ]] (AM) in New Castle and [[WYLE (FM)|WYLE]] (FM) in [[Grove City, Pennsylvania|Grove City]].  WKST is home to New Castle High School basketball and football broadcasts.  The station currently has one local talk show, which is hosted by longtime employee and Youngstown, Ohio resident Ken Hlebovy.  News coverage is provided by New Castle resident Wade Sutton.\n\n==History==\nWKST has been broadcasting in New Castle for over 70 years, but prior to November 5, 1999 it was at 1280&nbsp;kHz.  WKST signed on the air in 1938.  In the 1940s it was a Mutual affiliate.  In 1942 [[Alan Freed]] landed his first broadcasting job at WKST, before moving on to nearby [[WKBN (AM)|WKBN]] [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Ohio]], followed by [[WAKR]] [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and then [[WKNR|WJW]] [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] &mdash; the station where Freed is credited with first using and popularizing the term \"[[rock and roll]]\" to describe the music genre.  By the 1970s WKST was owned by Faye and Herb Scott, formerly based in [[Pottstown, Pennsylvania]], and held in the name of Great Scott Broadcasting.  Great Scott purchased FM station WFEM in [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania|Ellwood City]], and it became WKST-FM on January 1, 1988.  In the late 1990s, after the death of the Scotts, Great Scott decided to concentrate on its radio holdings in Delaware, and it sold WKST and WKST-FM to Jacor for $2.5 million in December 1998.\n\nPrior to November 5, 1999, the 1200&nbsp;kHz frequency was occupied by WBZY.  WBZY began broadcasting in 1968.  In December 1986 WBZY was sold by Lawrence County Broadcasting Corp. to a partnership called WBZY Radio Sam (the \"Sam\" representing the surname initials of partners Samuel M. Shirey, William G. Andrews and Robert L. McCracken).  Andrews sold his share to the other two partners in 1991. WBZY was then sold to Jacor in April 1999<ref>[http://newradiostar.com/NEWS/newsaprilmay1999.htm Newradiostar.com. April-May 1999 news.]</ref> for $800,000, and Jacor was purchased by [[Clear Channel Communications]] shortly thereafter.  Clear Channel, which also owned WKST, switched the call signs in November 1999. The calls of WKST-FM were changed to WJST on October 10, 2000, and WKST-FM call sign was moved to Pittsburgh where it could be used with Clear Channel's [[KISS-FM (brand)|KISS-FM]] brand.

He offers her some of his wares as gifts in exchange for a kiss and, as it is implied, sexual favours. She rejects all but one of his gifts, a turquoise ring, reasoning that having his wares but not him would be unbearable. The next morning, he pledges to marry her when he returns from selling his wares at the market. The song's narrative ends here; however, the poem concludes with the peddler being robbed and killed by a [[forest ranger]] whom he asks for directions while returning home with the profits made during his successful day at the market.\n\n==Melody==\n<score language=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\"> \n \\relative c' {\n \\time 4/4 \n    e4. gis8 b4 gis8 e8    a4. c8 e4 d8 c8    b4. c8 d4 e4    c4 a4 a2\n    \\repeat volta 2 { \n    f'4. g8 a4 g8 f8    e4. f8 e4 d8 c8   b4. c8 d4 e4    c4 a4 a2 }\n} \n</score>\n\n==Lyrics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\"\n|- cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n! !!

He offers her some of his wares as gifts in exchange for a kiss and, as it is implied, sexual favours. She rejects all but one of his gifts, a turquoise ring, reasoning that having his wares but not him would be unbearable. The next morning, he pledges to marry her when he returns from selling his wares at the market. The song's narrative ends here; however, the poem concludes with the peddler being robbed and killed by a [[forest ranger]] whom he asks for directions while returning home with the profits made during his successful day at the market.\n\n==Melody==\n<score language=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\"> \n \\relative c' {\n \\time 4/4 \n    e4. gis8 b4 gis8 e8    a4. c8 e4 d8 c8    b4. c8 d4 e4    c4 a4 a2\n    \\repeat volta 2 { \n    f'4. g8 a4 g8 f8    e4. f8 e4 d8 c8   b4. c8 d4 e4    c4 a4 a2 }\n} \n</score>\n\n==Lyrics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\"\n|- cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n! !!

One volume of the manga was published and the story remains unfinished. It was adapted into five-part [[original video animation]] (OVA) series in 1994. The plot of the anime differs significantly from the manga.  Both are notable for their extreme [[graphic violence]].\n\nThe OVA was produced by [[Bandai Visual]] and released in [[North America]] by [[Central Park Media|U.S. Manga Corps]]. ''Genocyber'' was also released by [[Manga Entertainment]]'s UK and Australian Divisions in The [[Cyberpunk]] Collection but only episodes 1-3 were released in these regions; this collection also included two other cyberpunk OVAs, ''[[Cyber City Oedo 808]]'' and ''[[A.D. Police Files|A.D. Police]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|section|date=June 2018}}\n===Episode 1: A New Life Form===\nSet in the near future when the world's nations are beginning to form a new global government, the first OVA is centered around a young girl named Elaine, and details the development and creation of a \"Genocyber\", an ultimate biological weapon created by combining the powers and consciousness of two psychic sisters. Funding for the project, which is under the direction of a mad scientist, is provided by the Kuryu Group (called Kuron in the English dub by Manga UK, but was corrected by Central Park Media for OVA's 4 and 5), a huge Japanese corporation that is a world leader in military research. Starting off in [[Hong Kong]], the story follows Elaine, a young girl with the nervous system of an animal, is central to the ambitions of the scientist who wants to combine the powers of Elaine and her crippled sister, Diana, to activate the Genocyber. Both being children of a former colleague of the scientist, of whom he betrayed his research over to the Kuryu group so that they could to receive funding for the research. \n\nIn its physical form, Genocyber is an extremely large humanoid monster, which the scientist calls a ''Vajra''.{{efn|name=\"Vajra\"|''[[Vajra]]'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning both \"thunderbolt\" and \"diamond\". In [[Buddhism]], the ''Vajra'' is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major branches of Buddhism, and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or bodhi as well as indestructibility (diamonds are the hardest natural material known).}} In addition to having almost unlimited strength and regenerative abilities, Genocyber also possesses incredible [[telekinetic]] and [[pyrokinetic]] powers.\n\nAfter a brutal search by the scientist and his masked henchmen for Elaine that leaves dozens of corpses in its wake, Elaine is chased by cyborg agents of the Kuryu group and the scientist is later arrested for going rogue and conducting his own research without the group's approval. During a battle where Diana wears a cybernetic suit of her own to try to catch her, Elaine supposedly dies, which leads to the cyborgs arresting the scientist and collecting Diana. However, Elaine (from within Diana) then uses her psychic power to merge with her and become Genocyber. In the ensuing battle, in which the scientist is killed, huge fires are started and numerous buildings are heavily damaged. Genocyber also destroys the cyborg agents and throws one of them through a moving airplane. The next morning, Elaine finds that her only friend, a young homeless boy called Davey, whom she met before she was captured, has died after falling from a construction site, likely to have been dropped by Wakayama, one of the Kuryu cyborgs. Elaine becomes filled with anger and screams, turning into Genocyber, and initiating a massive explosion which completely destroys Hong Kong, leaving only a barren wasteland in its place.\n\n=== Episodes 2-3: Vajranoid Attack & Global War===\n\nThe second OVA apparently occurs shortly after the first one ended. A country called Karain has withdrawn from the [[United Nations]] in protest of the new World government and launched an invasion of a neighboring country. In response, the [[United States]] agrees to deploy a [[Carrier Strike Group]] to support offensive operations against Karain; this fleet will be led by the ''Alexandria'', a massive futuristic [[Aircraft carrier|Supercarrier]], which is currently stationed off the coast of Japan.\n\nHowever, satellite photographs have identified an unknown superweapon believed to have been deployed by Karain (in fact, the image is of Genocyber, which destroyed several helicopters after they attacked and killed Elaine's friends). Concerned about the power of this new weapon, the United States military requests assistance from the Kuryu Group. Realizing that the image is in fact of Genocyber (although this is kept secret), the Kuryu Group agrees to send a team of its top scientists to the ''Alexandria''. The Kuryu scientists, including the mentally unstable Sakomizu, bring on board their own secret weapon, a newly created ''Vajra'', out of anticipation that the fleet will encounter Genocyber.\n\nUnlike Genocyber, this new ''Vajra'' has a completely robotic body that enables it to almost literally fuse with any machine or weapon it operates. This is demonstrated when the ''Vajra'' fuses with a fighter aircraft, enhancing the fighter's capabilities far beyond anything that would be possible for a human pilot.\n\nAs the fleet travels from Japan to Karain, the ''Vajra'' is conducting a test flight in a fighter when a UN scout plane operating near Karain radios in and requests to make an emergency landing. The pilot also has aboard a civilian he rescued near Karain: Elaine. As the scout plane approaches the carrier, Elaine senses the ''Vajra'', which in turn senses Elaine. Alarmed, the ''Vajra''{{'}}s fighter veers wildly off-course in pursuit of the scout plane, entering into a steep dive and narrowly avoids crashing into the carrier. The scout plane is forced to make a crash landing on carrier deck, although Elaine survives unscathed and is taken into the care of the crew.\n\nThe carrier's senior officers sharply rebuke Sakomizu for the ''Vajra''{{'}}s strange behavior, yelling at him that his ''Vajra'' is not only dangerous, but is also uncontrollable. Later, Sakomizu yells at the ''Vajra'' for embarrassing him.\n\nUnlike in the previous OVA, Elaine now has a largely cybernetic body from the neck down. Although it is unclear why and how this change occurred, it is possible that Elaine and Diana (whose body was cybernetic) have merged.\n\nA young female doctor, Myra, takes Elaine under her protection and gives her the name Laura. To Myra, Laura/Elaine reminds her of her own daughter (also named Laura) who died in the plane crash depicted in the first episode of the OVA, when Genocyber was fighting with the Kuryu cyborgs. Although Elaine is still mute, she is able to communicate telepathically with Myra, with whom she forms a special bond. Almost immediately, Myra comes to think of Elaine as her own child.\n\nNeither Myra nor the crew are aware of the girl's psychic abilities and her presence on board is briefly uneventful. However, numerous members of the crew begin experiencing nightmarish hallucinations and several suffer mental breakdowns. Soon after, the ''Vajra'' again senses Elaine, and interprets her presence (i.e. Genocyber's presence) as a threat to itself and the ship. Elaine also senses the new ''Vajra'', and after seeking it out, transforms into Genocyber and destroys it, but Genocyber's arm is hacked off during the fight. The ship's crew, unaware of what actually happened, simply conclude that Sakomizu's ''Vajra'' has malfunctioned again, and blame him for the incident (once again, Elaine survives without injury). However, Sakomizu, upon seeing his ''Vajra'' destroyed, is insulted and wrongly concludes that the crew sabotaged his work, although he now clearly suspects that Elaine is more than she appears to be. He eventually creates a new ''Vajra'' after acquiring Genocyber's severed arm but is unable to control it; the ''Vajra'' then expands throughout the carrier, engulfing and consuming the entire crew, except for Myra, whom Genocyber saves. Sakomizu also appears to survive initially, before he too is consumed by the ''Vajra''.\n\nGenocyber then flies into the carrier and reaches the core of the ''Vajra''. The ''Vajra'' attempts to fuse itself with Genocyber but Genocyber's psychic powers prove to be stronger and the ''Vajra'' loses control of his body and the consumed carrier, which detonates in a massive explosion.\n\nLater, Myra is rescued by a Karain helicopter as its pilots investigate the remains of the American fleet. Deciding that Myra is delirious, they fly back to Karain, but are horrified to discover that the entire country has been devastated. Genocyber then rises in the sky and spreads its wings, confirming that Karain has suffered a similar fate as [[Hong Kong]]. The episode ends with Genocyber flying away, as Myra, who has been driven to madness by the events, yells for Elaine, who she now truly believes to be Laura, to come back to her.\n\n=== Episodes 4-5: Legend of the City of the Grand Ark, Part I and Part II ===\n\nThe third OVA is much different from its previous ones, taking place in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic earth]], in a region called the City of the Grand Ark.\n\nThe young girl, Elaine, does not appear much in this episode, only a transparent image in the story. In this story, Genocyber eventually realizes that \"there was no place in the world for its power\" and is dormant until he reawakens at the end.\n\nIn a brief opening scene, the now-extremely elderly leader of the Kuryu Group is seen looking at a wall of computer screens that show Genocyber on a rampage of destruction. It is revealed that for 100 years, humanity has been waging a desperate and hopeless war against Genocyber, which has devastated the Earth. He vows to find some way to stop Genocyber, even if it takes centuries. All of a sudden, Genocyber then attacks his location, and a massive explosion is seen to rise into the Earth's atmosphere. The next scene, apparently set further into the future, shows a massive space station, possibly a colony ship, orbiting Earth. Aboard the station, a computer monitor indicates that it is now the year 2400 AD.\n\nThe story starts out in Ark de Grande City (City of the Grand Ark), one of the last remaining cities on earth, which is controlled by an evil mayor who claims that he is restoring the civilization that was destroyed by Genocyber, but only does this to gain trust from the civilians. The Mayor is ruthless, killing anyone who opposes him, and most of the city's population lives as an exploited labour class with few rights, while the mayor and an upper class live in luxury.\n\nThe story shifts to a couple, Ryu and Mel, whom Ryu is trying to find a doctor good enough to cure Mel's blindness. They arrive in Ark de Grande City but, as members of the lower class, are unable to get the medical help necessary to allow Mel to see again. Ryu and Mel attempt to earn money as performers, as Mel possesses an extraordinary ability to determine appearances, colours and numbers, even though she is blind. She describes her power as an ability to \"see the person's form floating in my mind.\" She also has remarkable hearing and can often sense the environment around her. Ryu has an ability to throw knives while blindfolded, and hit targets with pinpoint accuracy. After Ryu and Mel make love that night, Ryu says that he hopes to earn enough money so that they can leave the city as soon as possible.\n\nLater, Ryu is recruited by a member of the upper class to perform at his establishment, promising a large sum of money. However, the man tricks Ryu (who in blindfolded) into throwing knives at a real person who is tied to a wall, killing him, much to the delight of the spectators. Realizing that he has been tricked, Ryu manages to escape but is now pursued by the city's guards. While Ryu and Mel try to hide in the ruins beneath the city, Mel hears Elaine's voice calling to her, and she and Mel find themselves in a ritual chamber with the seemingly fossilized head and torso of Genocyber at the centre of an altar.\n\nA flashback then shows Genocyber on his rampage of destruction. An image of Diana appears, and her voice then calls to Elaine, telling her that \"It has to end. We can't stay in this world. We can't use our power\" The two sisters then join hands and disappear, while Genocyber appears lying on the ground, having seemingly been turned to stone. The scene shifts back to the present and to a shot of the massive space station orbiting the earth.\n\nIn a series of images, Mel is seen walking with Diana towards Genocyber's broken body. An image of Elaine appears in front of Genocyber, and Diana screams. In a subsequent dream, Diana refers to Mel as \"big sister.\"\n\nThe scene shifts back to Mel, who is taken in by the religious sect which opposes the Mayor. The sect believes that the destruction brought by Genocyber was a punishment from God, and believe that Mel is God's messenger, who will prevent such destruction from happening again. Meanwhile, Ryu makes his way up to the surface, where he is detained and subject to brutal interrogation by the police, after which he is apparently declared brain-dead. As Mel worries about Ryu, it is revealed that she is pregnant with his child.\n\nUnder orders to destroy anyone opposing the mayor, the city's troops then attack the sect's church, killing everyone, including (apparently) Mel, whose bullet-riddled body lies on the ground with the bodies of children surrounding her.\n\nIn an apparent dream, Diana begs Elaine not to turn into Genocyber again, stating that \"Our power has no place in this world.\" Mel, who appears to be in some sort of cocoon, asks Diana for help, stating that if she dies, the child she is carrying will never be born. She also states that she wants the city destroyed. Diana warns that asking for such power will unleash Genocyber, but it is too late: Genocyber awakens as Elaine, Diana, and Mel amalgamate into a red version of Genocyber, one which is much larger than its previous form. As Genocyber emerges, monitors aboard the orbiting space station switch on and begin recording the event. Genocyber then attacks the city, killing the mayor, and then all of its citizens. By the time Genocyber's rampage is over, the entire city has been left in ruins.\n\nAs Genocyber rises into the sky, whole pieces of the city's remains begin to tear away from the ground and rise into the air. Genocyber resurrects Mel and Ryu, and Mel is then torn from Genocyber; she and Ryu begin to slowly fall into the burning city. Genocyber then reverts to its earlier, smaller form, and images of Elaine and Diana are seen superimposed against Genocyber as it ascends into the sky. Genocyber then flies into space and attacks the orbiting space station, whose defenses open fire on Genocyber, but with no effect. Genocyber breaks into the station and watches a repeating broadcast of Genichiro Kuryu, the former leader of the Kuryu group, ordering his forces to destroy Genocyber. Diana's voice then calls to Elaine, and images of the girls superimposed against Genocyber are briefly seen before Genocyber begins to freeze itself and the entire space station. The station then falls out of orbit, and explodes as it enters the atmosphere.\n\nThe last scene shows Mel, who is no longer blind, and Ryu, lying unconscious in the ruins of the city. As Mel opens her eyes, she hears Diana's voice calling, \"Big sister...\", and the scene turns to the ruined body of Genocyber, and a baby is heard crying in the background.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Elaine''': A young mute girl who seems to be innocent in appearance, but when merged with her less powerful counterpart, she becomes Genocyber, capable of mass destruction as seen in all three OVAs. Her friend was a young boy who devoted himself to protect her, but was unable to when the Kuryu cyborg agents killed him. After transforming into Genocyber for the first time from within her sister Diana after reminding her that Kuryu scientist; Kenneth Reed was not their real father, devastating a large chunk of Hong Kong and after seeing the death of the boy, this causes Elaine to go berserk and Genocyber completely wipes out all of Hong Kong. In the second OVA, Elaine is named \"Laura\" by a young doctor, Myra, who once had a daughter about that age but died in a plane accident caused by Genocyber in Hong Kong, but Myra is unaware of this. All this happens after Elaine becomes Genocyber again, avenging some children that she sees getting killed by a military attack squad and their spirits can later be seen by her. In the third OVA, Elaine appears much as in a dormant state, confined to her dream-like world with her older sister, Diana. It is not fully explained in the beginning, but is later revealed that both Elaine and Diana realized that their \"power wasn't meant to be for this world\" and they decided to go into a state of \"seclusion\", only to be reawakened when Genocyber decides to destroy the City of the Grand Ark, killing everyone except for Mel and Ryu. Genocyber then flies into space and destroys an orbiting space station with Kyuru's former leader on a screen, talking about the destruction of Genocyber. It is not known what happens to Genocyber afterward. It is implied through subsequent imagery that Elaine and Diana's consciousnesses still exist within Genocyber, although it is unknown if Genocyber is still alive or if Elaine (or Diana) can ever re manifest herself and return to normal as seen in the first two OVAs. \n\n'''Diana''': Elaine's older sister. She seems to have great power as well, but is almost nothing compared to her younger sister, as shown in part one of the OVA. Diana's body is completely artificial, except for her head, due to Kenneth Reed's harsh experiments on her, so that she could control Elaine and her ''Vajra'' energy. Diana is quite jealous of her sister's skills and abilities, which causes her to try to kill her sister several times, yet proves to be futile, though comes close where the two Kuryu cyborgs had Ellaine distracted by holding her young friend hostage. She merges with Elaine in the first OVA after being dismembered, with Elaine consciously controlling the body, and does not appear again until the third OVA. It is also noted that without mechanical parts, Diana is immobile.\n\n'''Genocyber''': The complete hybrid of the two sisters, Genocyber is the ultimate biological humanoid weapon (what its creator dubs a ''Vajra'' or ''Vajranoid''{{efn|name=\"Vajra\"}} who is seemingly immortal and is nearly omnipotent. It is considered a god by the underground sect of the Grand Arc City. It fought with the Earth's forces for 100 years, but after the two sisters realized their mistake in existing in the world, they lay dormant underground. Its original appearance is a {{convert|7|ft|m|sing=on}} green monster with two horns protruding from its head. It also has angel-like wings that appear to glow when it flies. Its second form is much larger, taller than a skyscraper, causing mass destruction within the City of the Grand Ark. Its full form is a dragon-like creature. Exactly how Genocyber was created from the bodies and souls of the two sisters remains a mystery, but it is somehow connected to the ''Vajra'' energies that both sisters possess. \n\n'''Kenneth Reed''': Claiming to be Elaine's and Diana's father, he both supports them to become a hybrid strong enough to prove the power of ''Vajra''. He is near succession when Elaine suddenly escapes. He eventually dies after being taken custody of the two Kuryu cyborgs, smiling as he watches his creation bloom out in the world.\n\n'''Myra''': A female doctor who only appears in the second OVA, who takes care of Elaine after she is rescued by a civilian plane. Myra is very protective of Elaine, especially when people push her around for her unusual animal-like behavior. Myra eventually survives the carrier's destruction thanks to Genocyber's protection, and is later rescued by two Karain soldiers though her sanity is well and truly lost by that time.\n\n'''Mel''': A beautiful, mysterious young woman who is blind and needs money for the operation to cure her, and obtains money by fortune-telling with her amazing psychic abilities. She is very calm and timid, and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Ryu. When she takes refuge in the underground sect, they believe her to be a messenger from God. She is depressed at the moment because of Ryu's disappearance and her pregnant state. She eventually dies at one point in the third OVA, along with the entire underground sect, but then is brought back to life by Genocyber when she and the two sisters fuse together as she states in the hyperdimensional mandala scene, \"I want this city destroyed.\" She is cured of her blindness at the end. There seems to be some connection between her and Diana, since they constantly communicate in Mel's dreams, whom Diana also calls \"Big sister.\" It's possible that Elaine also feels the same way about Mel.\n\n'''Ryu''': A handsome young man who is Mel's boyfriend. He aids in helping Mel cure her blindness, but does not have enough money to do so. One day, he is to throw knives at a target to gain money. He was tricked into killing a man and is pursued by the city's government. He is eventually caught and put into custody. He is later shown unconscious at the end of the third OVA with Mel, who wakes up to find her dearest asleep.\n\n'''Genichiro Kuryu''': The chairman of Kuryu, he was first introduced in the series as a young boy controlling a giant company. In the second OVA, he sends an attack on the country Karain by making the overall decision. In the third OVA, Genichiro has become an old man, fighting for over 100 years with Genocyber, which was all to no avail. He himself states, \"Who created you to give you so much power?\" He later appears in a screen in an outer-space object, repeating a phrase, \"destroy the target (Genocyber)\" over and over again. The mysterious object was frozen by Genocyber itself and perhaps destroyed. He was likely the one to have sent the cyborgs in the first OVA to retrieve the sisters and Kenneth Reed when he feels that the professor was acting more on his own than to the standards of his company.\n\n'''Dr. Nguyen Morgan''': Elaine and Diana's true father. He was the first to come up with an idea to create a Vajranoid, using the power of ''Vajra'' or 'mind shadows' whose power was limitless, and tries to achieve this by testing his wife Tanya by creating a mandala to carry out his work. He was assisted by Kenneth Reed, who later wanted the credit of producing such a weapon, and eventually betrays Morgan to the Kuryu group for more funding, of which Morgan was then killed. The time and place of the birth of Elaine and Diana are unknown, but they were born after an explosion took place at a research center, with a surviving Tanya. Nguyen Morgan appears only in the flashbacks of the first and second OVAs.\n\n'''Sakomizu''': A scientist who wishes to surpass Morgan's research and does this by also creating a vajranoid weapon. (This Vajuranoid seems to be disobedient, like Elaine, and does things by its own free will) He succeeds in creating a powerful ''Vajra'', but it proves to be no match for Genocyber in combat. He eventually creates a second ''Vajra'' that was made from Genocyber's severed arm when it was fighting his first ''Vajra''. Sakomizu becomes insane, as the ''Vajra'' absorbs the entire crew of the carrier Alexandria and eventually the whole ship. Sakomizu is also by this time controlled by the ''Vajra'', only to be first attacked by Myra, and then killed by Elaine. He, like all scientists who attempted to create an ideal ''Vajra'', died in the end.\n\n'''Davey''': A detective working for the Hong Kong Police Department who tried to uncover the sinister plans of the Kuryu group, but as he came close to finding out what's going on, Kenneth Reed and many of his masked staff find him, tied him to a bed and was disembowelled, exposing his internal organs.  \n\n'''Ketsu, Wakayama & Amachi''': These three cyborg agents are sent to retrieve Elaine and Diana for the Kuryu group. Ketsu is killed by ripping open his own brain on a subway line when Elaine makes him think that they are bugs inside him. Both Wakayama and Amachi both transform into hideous cyborg abominations later on and both are destroyed by Genocyber. Amachi is torn apart, while Wakayama is smashed through an airplane, the same one that Mira's daughter; Laura was in, though that isn't revealed until the second OVA.\n\n'''Captain''': Captain of the Alexandria. He is also eventually fused with the ship's vajuranoid, and dies in the end with the entire crew when Genocyber emits its great power.\n\n'''Mayor''': An evil politician who is a hypocrite, and kills anyone who opposes the law of his city; the Grand Arc. He dies near the end when Genocyber throws his parade car into a building.\n\n'''Master''': A priest of the underground sect of the Grand Arc, who is convinced that Mel was a messenger from God. He, as well as the whole sect, including a young boy he is seen talking to, are killed by a task force sent by the mayor to eliminate the cult.\n\n==Reception==\n''Genocyber'' was criticized for its extremely graphic violence. Justin Sevakis from [[Anime News Network]] stated that the OVA \"takes sadistic glee in being as graphic as possible\" and \"you have to be able to appreciate anger, the sort of nihilism and angst that fills and infects one's soul\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-10-04 |title=Buried Treasure: Genocyber |first=Justin |last=Sevakis |website=Anime News Network |date=October 4, 2007}}</ref> \n\nDavid Cox from [[Otaku USA]] magazine recommended the OVA \"see ''Genocyber,'' you won\u2019t regret it\" and highlighted \"the impact of [[John Carpenter|John Carpenters]] classic ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' can be seen in ''Genocyber 1'', as can slasher and gore spectacles of the sort celebrated in magazines like ''[[Film Threat]]'' and ''[[Fangoria]]\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://otakuusamagazine.com/animes-most-deadly-genocyber-episode-1/|title=Anime's Most Deadly: Genocyber Episode 1|date=2014-04-17|website=Otaku USA Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0158634}}\n*{{ann|manga|10}}\n\n{{Anime International Company}}\n\n[[Category:1994 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:Central Park Media]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Sh\u014d Aikawa]]\n[[Category:Viz Media manga]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Unfinished comics]]\n[[Category:Biopunk anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Genocyber\n| image           = Genocyber manga cover.jpg\n| caption         = Cover of the manga.\n| ja_kanji        = \u30b8\u30a7\u30ce\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\n| ja_romaji       = Jenosaib\u0101\n| genre           = [[Cyberpunk]], [[science fiction]], [[Splatter film|splatter]]<!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

One volume of the manga was published and the story remains unfinished. It was adapted into five-part [[original video animation]] (OVA) series in 1994. The plot of the anime differs significantly from the manga.  Both are notable for their extreme [[graphic violence]].\n\nThe OVA was produced by [[Bandai Visual]] and released in [[North America]] by [[Central Park Media|U.S. Manga Corps]]. ''Genocyber'' was also released by [[Manga Entertainment]]'s UK and Australian Divisions in The [[Cyberpunk]] Collection but only episodes 1-3 were released in these regions; this collection also included two other cyberpunk OVAs, ''[[Cyber City Oedo 808]]'' and ''[[A.D. Police Files|A.D. Police]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Plot|section|date=June 2018}}\n===Episode 1: A New Life Form===\nSet in the near future when the world's nations are beginning to form a new global government, the first OVA is centered around a young girl named Elaine, and details the development and creation of a \"Genocyber\", an ultimate biological weapon created by combining the powers and consciousness of two psychic sisters. Funding for the project, which is under the direction of a mad scientist, is provided by the Kuryu Group (called Kuron in the English dub by Manga UK, but was corrected by Central Park Media for OVA's 4 and 5), a huge Japanese corporation that is a world leader in military research. Starting off in [[Hong Kong]], the story follows Elaine, a young girl with the nervous system of an animal, is central to the ambitions of the scientist who wants to combine the powers of Elaine and her crippled sister, Diana, to activate the Genocyber. Both being children of a former colleague of the scientist, of whom he betrayed his research over to the Kuryu group so that they could to receive funding for the research. \n\nIn its physical form, Genocyber is an extremely large humanoid monster, which the scientist calls a ''Vajra''.{{efn|name=\"Vajra\"|''[[Vajra]]'' is a [[Sanskrit]] word meaning both \"thunderbolt\" and \"diamond\". In [[Buddhism]], the ''Vajra'' is the symbol of Vajrayana, one of the three major branches of Buddhism, and can imply the thunderbolt experience of Buddhist enlightenment or bodhi as well as indestructibility (diamonds are the hardest natural material known).}} In addition to having almost unlimited strength and regenerative abilities, Genocyber also possesses incredible [[telekinetic]] and [[pyrokinetic]] powers.\n\nAfter a brutal search by the scientist and his masked henchmen for Elaine that leaves dozens of corpses in its wake, Elaine is chased by cyborg agents of the Kuryu group and the scientist is later arrested for going rogue and conducting his own research without the group's approval. During a battle where Diana wears a cybernetic suit of her own to try to catch her, Elaine supposedly dies, which leads to the cyborgs arresting the scientist and collecting Diana. However, Elaine (from within Diana) then uses her psychic power to merge with her and become Genocyber. In the ensuing battle, in which the scientist is killed, huge fires are started and numerous buildings are heavily damaged. Genocyber also destroys the cyborg agents and throws one of them through a moving airplane. The next morning, Elaine finds that her only friend, a young homeless boy called Davey, whom she met before she was captured, has died after falling from a construction site, likely to have been dropped by Wakayama, one of the Kuryu cyborgs. Elaine becomes filled with anger and screams, turning into Genocyber, and initiating a massive explosion which completely destroys Hong Kong, leaving only a barren wasteland in its place.\n\n=== Episodes 2-3: Vajranoid Attack & Global War===\n\nThe second OVA apparently occurs shortly after the first one ended. A country called Karain has withdrawn from the [[United Nations]] in protest of the new World government and launched an invasion of a neighboring country. In response, the [[United States]] agrees to deploy a [[Carrier Strike Group]] to support offensive operations against Karain; this fleet will be led by the ''Alexandria'', a massive futuristic [[Aircraft carrier|Supercarrier]], which is currently stationed off the coast of Japan.\n\nHowever, satellite photographs have identified an unknown superweapon believed to have been deployed by Karain (in fact, the image is of Genocyber, which destroyed several helicopters after they attacked and killed Elaine's friends). Concerned about the power of this new weapon, the United States military requests assistance from the Kuryu Group. Realizing that the image is in fact of Genocyber (although this is kept secret), the Kuryu Group agrees to send a team of its top scientists to the ''Alexandria''. The Kuryu scientists, including the mentally unstable Sakomizu, bring on board their own secret weapon, a newly created ''Vajra'', out of anticipation that the fleet will encounter Genocyber.\n\nUnlike Genocyber, this new ''Vajra'' has a completely robotic body that enables it to almost literally fuse with any machine or weapon it operates. This is demonstrated when the ''Vajra'' fuses with a fighter aircraft, enhancing the fighter's capabilities far beyond anything that would be possible for a human pilot.\n\nAs the fleet travels from Japan to Karain, the ''Vajra'' is conducting a test flight in a fighter when a UN scout plane operating near Karain radios in and requests to make an emergency landing. The pilot also has aboard a civilian he rescued near Karain: Elaine. As the scout plane approaches the carrier, Elaine senses the ''Vajra'', which in turn senses Elaine. Alarmed, the ''Vajra''{{'}}s fighter veers wildly off-course in pursuit of the scout plane, entering into a steep dive and narrowly avoids crashing into the carrier. The scout plane is forced to make a crash landing on carrier deck, although Elaine survives unscathed and is taken into the care of the crew.\n\nThe carrier's senior officers sharply rebuke Sakomizu for the ''Vajra''{{'}}s strange behavior, yelling at him that his ''Vajra'' is not only dangerous, but is also uncontrollable. Later, Sakomizu yells at the ''Vajra'' for embarrassing him.\n\nUnlike in the previous OVA, Elaine now has a largely cybernetic body from the neck down. Although it is unclear why and how this change occurred, it is possible that Elaine and Diana (whose body was cybernetic) have merged.\n\nA young female doctor, Myra, takes Elaine under her protection and gives her the name Laura. To Myra, Laura/Elaine reminds her of her own daughter (also named Laura) who died in the plane crash depicted in the first episode of the OVA, when Genocyber was fighting with the Kuryu cyborgs. Although Elaine is still mute, she is able to communicate telepathically with Myra, with whom she forms a special bond. Almost immediately, Myra comes to think of Elaine as her own child.\n\nNeither Myra nor the crew are aware of the girl's psychic abilities and her presence on board is briefly uneventful. However, numerous members of the crew begin experiencing nightmarish hallucinations and several suffer mental breakdowns. Soon after, the ''Vajra'' again senses Elaine, and interprets her presence (i.e. Genocyber's presence) as a threat to itself and the ship. Elaine also senses the new ''Vajra'', and after seeking it out, transforms into Genocyber and destroys it, but Genocyber's arm is hacked off during the fight. The ship's crew, unaware of what actually happened, simply conclude that Sakomizu's ''Vajra'' has malfunctioned again, and blame him for the incident (once again, Elaine survives without injury). However, Sakomizu, upon seeing his ''Vajra'' destroyed, is insulted and wrongly concludes that the crew sabotaged his work, although he now clearly suspects that Elaine is more than she appears to be. He eventually creates a new ''Vajra'' after acquiring Genocyber's severed arm but is unable to control it; the ''Vajra'' then expands throughout the carrier, engulfing and consuming the entire crew, except for Myra, whom Genocyber saves. Sakomizu also appears to survive initially, before he too is consumed by the ''Vajra''.\n\nGenocyber then flies into the carrier and reaches the core of the ''Vajra''. The ''Vajra'' attempts to fuse itself with Genocyber but Genocyber's psychic powers prove to be stronger and the ''Vajra'' loses control of his body and the consumed carrier, which detonates in a massive explosion.\n\nLater, Myra is rescued by a Karain helicopter as its pilots investigate the remains of the American fleet. Deciding that Myra is delirious, they fly back to Karain, but are horrified to discover that the entire country has been devastated. Genocyber then rises in the sky and spreads its wings, confirming that Karain has suffered a similar fate as [[Hong Kong]]. The episode ends with Genocyber flying away, as Myra, who has been driven to madness by the events, yells for Elaine, who she now truly believes to be Laura, to come back to her.\n\n=== Episodes 4-5: Legend of the City of the Grand Ark, Part I and Part II ===\n\nThe third OVA is much different from its previous ones, taking place in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic earth]], in a region called the City of the Grand Ark.\n\nThe young girl, Elaine, does not appear much in this episode, only a transparent image in the story. In this story, Genocyber eventually realizes that \"there was no place in the world for its power\" and is dormant until he reawakens at the end.\n\nIn a brief opening scene, the now-extremely elderly leader of the Kuryu Group is seen looking at a wall of computer screens that show Genocyber on a rampage of destruction. It is revealed that for 100 years, humanity has been waging a desperate and hopeless war against Genocyber, which has devastated the Earth. He vows to find some way to stop Genocyber, even if it takes centuries. All of a sudden, Genocyber then attacks his location, and a massive explosion is seen to rise into the Earth's atmosphere. The next scene, apparently set further into the future, shows a massive space station, possibly a colony ship, orbiting Earth. Aboard the station, a computer monitor indicates that it is now the year 2400 AD.\n\nThe story starts out in Ark de Grande City (City of the Grand Ark), one of the last remaining cities on earth, which is controlled by an evil mayor who claims that he is restoring the civilization that was destroyed by Genocyber, but only does this to gain trust from the civilians. The Mayor is ruthless, killing anyone who opposes him, and most of the city's population lives as an exploited labour class with few rights, while the mayor and an upper class live in luxury.\n\nThe story shifts to a couple, Ryu and Mel, whom Ryu is trying to find a doctor good enough to cure Mel's blindness. They arrive in Ark de Grande City but, as members of the lower class, are unable to get the medical help necessary to allow Mel to see again. Ryu and Mel attempt to earn money as performers, as Mel possesses an extraordinary ability to determine appearances, colours and numbers, even though she is blind. She describes her power as an ability to \"see the person's form floating in my mind.\" She also has remarkable hearing and can often sense the environment around her. Ryu has an ability to throw knives while blindfolded, and hit targets with pinpoint accuracy. After Ryu and Mel make love that night, Ryu says that he hopes to earn enough money so that they can leave the city as soon as possible.\n\nLater, Ryu is recruited by a member of the upper class to perform at his establishment, promising a large sum of money. However, the man tricks Ryu (who in blindfolded) into throwing knives at a real person who is tied to a wall, killing him, much to the delight of the spectators. Realizing that he has been tricked, Ryu manages to escape but is now pursued by the city's guards. While Ryu and Mel try to hide in the ruins beneath the city, Mel hears Elaine's voice calling to her, and she and Mel find themselves in a ritual chamber with the seemingly fossilized head and torso of Genocyber at the centre of an altar.\n\nA flashback then shows Genocyber on his rampage of destruction. An image of Diana appears, and her voice then calls to Elaine, telling her that \"It has to end. We can't stay in this world. We can't use our power\" The two sisters then join hands and disappear, while Genocyber appears lying on the ground, having seemingly been turned to stone. The scene shifts back to the present and to a shot of the massive space station orbiting the earth.\n\nIn a series of images, Mel is seen walking with Diana towards Genocyber's broken body. An image of Elaine appears in front of Genocyber, and Diana screams. In a subsequent dream, Diana refers to Mel as \"big sister.\"\n\nThe scene shifts back to Mel, who is taken in by the religious sect which opposes the Mayor. The sect believes that the destruction brought by Genocyber was a punishment from God, and believe that Mel is God's messenger, who will prevent such destruction from happening again. Meanwhile, Ryu makes his way up to the surface, where he is detained and subject to brutal interrogation by the police, after which he is apparently declared brain-dead. As Mel worries about Ryu, it is revealed that she is pregnant with his child.\n\nUnder orders to destroy anyone opposing the mayor, the city's troops then attack the sect's church, killing everyone, including (apparently) Mel, whose bullet-riddled body lies on the ground with the bodies of children surrounding her.\n\nIn an apparent dream, Diana begs Elaine not to turn into Genocyber again, stating that \"Our power has no place in this world.\" Mel, who appears to be in some sort of cocoon, asks Diana for help, stating that if she dies, the child she is carrying will never be born. She also states that she wants the city destroyed. Diana warns that asking for such power will unleash Genocyber, but it is too late: Genocyber awakens as Elaine, Diana, and Mel amalgamate into a red version of Genocyber, one which is much larger than its previous form. As Genocyber emerges, monitors aboard the orbiting space station switch on and begin recording the event. Genocyber then attacks the city, killing the mayor, and then all of its citizens. By the time Genocyber's rampage is over, the entire city has been left in ruins.\n\nAs Genocyber rises into the sky, whole pieces of the city's remains begin to tear away from the ground and rise into the air. Genocyber resurrects Mel and Ryu, and Mel is then torn from Genocyber; she and Ryu begin to slowly fall into the burning city. Genocyber then reverts to its earlier, smaller form, and images of Elaine and Diana are seen superimposed against Genocyber as it ascends into the sky. Genocyber then flies into space and attacks the orbiting space station, whose defenses open fire on Genocyber, but with no effect. Genocyber breaks into the station and watches a repeating broadcast of Genichiro Kuryu, the former leader of the Kuryu group, ordering his forces to destroy Genocyber. Diana's voice then calls to Elaine, and images of the girls superimposed against Genocyber are briefly seen before Genocyber begins to freeze itself and the entire space station. The station then falls out of orbit, and explodes as it enters the atmosphere.\n\nThe last scene shows Mel, who is no longer blind, and Ryu, lying unconscious in the ruins of the city. As Mel opens her eyes, she hears Diana's voice calling, \"Big sister...\", and the scene turns to the ruined body of Genocyber, and a baby is heard crying in the background.\n\n==Characters==\n'''Elaine''': A young mute girl who seems to be innocent in appearance, but when merged with her less powerful counterpart, she becomes Genocyber, capable of mass destruction as seen in all three OVAs. Her friend was a young boy who devoted himself to protect her, but was unable to when the Kuryu cyborg agents killed him. After transforming into Genocyber for the first time from within her sister Diana after reminding her that Kuryu scientist; Kenneth Reed was not their real father, devastating a large chunk of Hong Kong and after seeing the death of the boy, this causes Elaine to go berserk and Genocyber completely wipes out all of Hong Kong. In the second OVA, Elaine is named \"Laura\" by a young doctor, Myra, who once had a daughter about that age but died in a plane accident caused by Genocyber in Hong Kong, but Myra is unaware of this. All this happens after Elaine becomes Genocyber again, avenging some children that she sees getting killed by a military attack squad and their spirits can later be seen by her. In the third OVA, Elaine appears much as in a dormant state, confined to her dream-like world with her older sister, Diana. It is not fully explained in the beginning, but is later revealed that both Elaine and Diana realized that their \"power wasn't meant to be for this world\" and they decided to go into a state of \"seclusion\", only to be reawakened when Genocyber decides to destroy the City of the Grand Ark, killing everyone except for Mel and Ryu. Genocyber then flies into space and destroys an orbiting space station with Kyuru's former leader on a screen, talking about the destruction of Genocyber. It is not known what happens to Genocyber afterward. It is implied through subsequent imagery that Elaine and Diana's consciousnesses still exist within Genocyber, although it is unknown if Genocyber is still alive or if Elaine (or Diana) can ever re manifest herself and return to normal as seen in the first two OVAs. \n\n'''Diana''': Elaine's older sister. She seems to have great power as well, but is almost nothing compared to her younger sister, as shown in part one of the OVA. Diana's body is completely artificial, except for her head, due to Kenneth Reed's harsh experiments on her, so that she could control Elaine and her ''Vajra'' energy. Diana is quite jealous of her sister's skills and abilities, which causes her to try to kill her sister several times, yet proves to be futile, though comes close where the two Kuryu cyborgs had Ellaine distracted by holding her young friend hostage. She merges with Elaine in the first OVA after being dismembered, with Elaine consciously controlling the body, and does not appear again until the third OVA. It is also noted that without mechanical parts, Diana is immobile.\n\n'''Genocyber''': The complete hybrid of the two sisters, Genocyber is the ultimate biological humanoid weapon (what its creator dubs a ''Vajra'' or ''Vajranoid''{{efn|name=\"Vajra\"}} who is seemingly immortal and is nearly omnipotent. It is considered a god by the underground sect of the Grand Arc City. It fought with the Earth's forces for 100 years, but after the two sisters realized their mistake in existing in the world, they lay dormant underground. Its original appearance is a {{convert|7|ft|m|sing=on}} green monster with two horns protruding from its head. It also has angel-like wings that appear to glow when it flies. Its second form is much larger, taller than a skyscraper, causing mass destruction within the City of the Grand Ark. Its full form is a dragon-like creature. Exactly how Genocyber was created from the bodies and souls of the two sisters remains a mystery, but it is somehow connected to the ''Vajra'' energies that both sisters possess. \n\n'''Kenneth Reed''': Claiming to be Elaine's and Diana's father, he both supports them to become a hybrid strong enough to prove the power of ''Vajra''. He is near succession when Elaine suddenly escapes. He eventually dies after being taken custody of the two Kuryu cyborgs, smiling as he watches his creation bloom out in the world.\n\n'''Myra''': A female doctor who only appears in the second OVA, who takes care of Elaine after she is rescued by a civilian plane. Myra is very protective of Elaine, especially when people push her around for her unusual animal-like behavior. Myra eventually survives the carrier's destruction thanks to Genocyber's protection, and is later rescued by two Karain soldiers though her sanity is well and truly lost by that time.\n\n'''Mel''': A beautiful, mysterious young woman who is blind and needs money for the operation to cure her, and obtains money by fortune-telling with her amazing psychic abilities. She is very calm and timid, and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Ryu. When she takes refuge in the underground sect, they believe her to be a messenger from God. She is depressed at the moment because of Ryu's disappearance and her pregnant state. She eventually dies at one point in the third OVA, along with the entire underground sect, but then is brought back to life by Genocyber when she and the two sisters fuse together as she states in the hyperdimensional mandala scene, \"I want this city destroyed.\" She is cured of her blindness at the end. There seems to be some connection between her and Diana, since they constantly communicate in Mel's dreams, whom Diana also calls \"Big sister.\" It's possible that Elaine also feels the same way about Mel.\n\n'''Ryu''': A handsome young man who is Mel's boyfriend. He aids in helping Mel cure her blindness, but does not have enough money to do so. One day, he is to throw knives at a target to gain money. He was tricked into killing a man and is pursued by the city's government. He is eventually caught and put into custody. He is later shown unconscious at the end of the third OVA with Mel, who wakes up to find her dearest asleep.\n\n'''Genichiro Kuryu''': The chairman of Kuryu, he was first introduced in the series as a young boy controlling a giant company. In the second OVA, he sends an attack on the country Karain by making the overall decision. In the third OVA, Genichiro has become an old man, fighting for over 100 years with Genocyber, which was all to no avail. He himself states, \"Who created you to give you so much power?\" He later appears in a screen in an outer-space object, repeating a phrase, \"destroy the target (Genocyber)\" over and over again. The mysterious object was frozen by Genocyber itself and perhaps destroyed. He was likely the one to have sent the cyborgs in the first OVA to retrieve the sisters and Kenneth Reed when he feels that the professor was acting more on his own than to the standards of his company.\n\n'''Dr. Nguyen Morgan''': Elaine and Diana's true father. He was the first to come up with an idea to create a Vajranoid, using the power of ''Vajra'' or 'mind shadows' whose power was limitless, and tries to achieve this by testing his wife Tanya by creating a mandala to carry out his work. He was assisted by Kenneth Reed, who later wanted the credit of producing such a weapon, and eventually betrays Morgan to the Kuryu group for more funding, of which Morgan was then killed. The time and place of the birth of Elaine and Diana are unknown, but they were born after an explosion took place at a research center, with a surviving Tanya. Nguyen Morgan appears only in the flashbacks of the first and second OVAs.\n\n'''Sakomizu''': A scientist who wishes to surpass Morgan's research and does this by also creating a vajranoid weapon. (This Vajuranoid seems to be disobedient, like Elaine, and does things by its own free will) He succeeds in creating a powerful ''Vajra'', but it proves to be no match for Genocyber in combat. He eventually creates a second ''Vajra'' that was made from Genocyber's severed arm when it was fighting his first ''Vajra''. Sakomizu becomes insane, as the ''Vajra'' absorbs the entire crew of the carrier Alexandria and eventually the whole ship. Sakomizu is also by this time controlled by the ''Vajra'', only to be first attacked by Myra, and then killed by Elaine. He, like all scientists who attempted to create an ideal ''Vajra'', died in the end.\n\n'''Davey''': A detective working for the Hong Kong Police Department who tried to uncover the sinister plans of the Kuryu group, but as he came close to finding out what's going on, Kenneth Reed and many of his masked staff find him, tied him to a bed and was disembowelled, exposing his internal organs.  \n\n'''Ketsu, Wakayama & Amachi''': These three cyborg agents are sent to retrieve Elaine and Diana for the Kuryu group. Ketsu is killed by ripping open his own brain on a subway line when Elaine makes him think that they are bugs inside him. Both Wakayama and Amachi both transform into hideous cyborg abominations later on and both are destroyed by Genocyber. Amachi is torn apart, while Wakayama is smashed through an airplane, the same one that Mira's daughter; Laura was in, though that isn't revealed until the second OVA.\n\n'''Captain''': Captain of the Alexandria. He is also eventually fused with the ship's vajuranoid, and dies in the end with the entire crew when Genocyber emits its great power.\n\n'''Mayor''': An evil politician who is a hypocrite, and kills anyone who opposes the law of his city; the Grand Arc. He dies near the end when Genocyber throws his parade car into a building.\n\n'''Master''': A priest of the underground sect of the Grand Arc, who is convinced that Mel was a messenger from God. He, as well as the whole sect, including a young boy he is seen talking to, are killed by a task force sent by the mayor to eliminate the cult.\n\n==Reception==\n''Genocyber'' was criticized for its extremely graphic violence. Justin Sevakis from [[Anime News Network]] stated that the OVA \"takes sadistic glee in being as graphic as possible\" and \"you have to be able to appreciate anger, the sort of nihilism and angst that fills and infects one's soul\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2007-10-04 |title=Buried Treasure: Genocyber |first=Justin |last=Sevakis |website=Anime News Network |date=October 4, 2007}}</ref> \n\nDavid Cox from [[Otaku USA]] magazine recommended the OVA \"see ''Genocyber,'' you won\u2019t regret it\" and highlighted \"the impact of [[John Carpenter|John Carpenters]] classic ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' can be seen in ''Genocyber 1'', as can slasher and gore spectacles of the sort celebrated in magazines like ''[[Film Threat]]'' and ''[[Fangoria]]\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://otakuusamagazine.com/animes-most-deadly-genocyber-episode-1/|title=Anime's Most Deadly: Genocyber Episode 1|date=2014-04-17|website=Otaku USA Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{ann|manga|10}}\n* {{IMDb title|0158634}}\n\n{{Anime International Company}}\n\n[[Category:1994 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:Central Park Media]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Sh\u014d Aikawa]]\n[[Category:Viz Media manga]]\n[[Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Unfinished comics]]\n[[Category:Biopunk anime and manga]]\n", "name_user": "Amda1986", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocyber"}
