The video starts out with Amy entering the studio late as the band is already in mid-rehearsal, and her bandmates give her concerned looks as to why she seems so out of it, while Amy starts shedding her outdoor garbs to loosen up. She sits down on her bed and trades her discomforting heels for the comfort of throw rugs under her bare feet, grabbing hold of her mic stand and flashing her band a reassuring gesture. They begin to perform \"Brokenhearted\". The night before, Amy, Nick, their band members and other friends party in an apartment, complete with drinking, dancing, a game of darts and [[table tennis]]. Amy thinks she and Nick have a romantic connection. The next morning, Amy furiously checks her phone to see if Nick has called, but he hasn't. At the end of band rehearsals, it turns out that Nick is already seeing someone else.\n\n==Live performances==\nThe band debuted their live televised performance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on February 11, 2012.<ref name=\"Karmin Unleashes New Single\" /><ref name=\"Karmin's Amy Heidemann and Nick Noonan Release 'Broken Hearted'\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Channing Tatum, Zooey Deschanel to host 'Saturday Night Live' in February|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/01/11/channing-tatum-zooey-deschanel-to-host-saturday-night-live-in-february/116119/|work=|publisher=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=February 4, 2012}}</ref> The band continued a promotional push for the single by appearing and performing the song on [[VH1]] Big Morning Buzz Live, and also announcing that the release date for the album was set for May 8, 2012.

The video starts out with Amy entering the studio late as the band is already in mid-rehearsal, and her bandmates give her concerned looks as to why she seems so out of it, while Amy starts shedding her outdoor garbs to loosen up. She sits down on her bed and trades her discomforting heels for the comfort of throw rugs under her bare feet, grabbing hold of her mic stand and flashing her band a reassuring gesture. They begin to perform \"Brokenhearted\". The night before, Amy, Nick, their band members and other friends party in an apartment, complete with drinking, dancing, a game of darts and [[table tennis]]. Amy thinks she and Nick have a romantic connection. The next morning, Amy furiously checks her phone to see if Nick has called, but he hasn't.

He or she performs functions similar to those of a [[Governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nStrictly speaking, the appointment of an Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council, that is, the Governor-General acting on the ''advice'' of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Commonwealth Government]], rather than the advice of the [[Government of the Northern Territory]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 - SECT 32 Office of Administrator |url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1978425/s32.html |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=22 May 2019|via=[[Austlii]] }}</ref>  The Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978, in accordance with the provisions of the ''[[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978]] ([[Australian Parliament|Cth]])''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1978425/}}</ref>  Since then, the practice has arisen that in making an appointment the Governor-General-in-Council will act on the ''recommendation'' of the Northern Territory Government.\n\nUnlike an Australian [[Governors of the Australian states|State Governor]], the Administrator is not the ''direct'' representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen]] in the Territory but is instead appointed by the Queen's representative in the Commonwealth, the Governor-General, to administer the Territory in accordance with the Act. In practice, however, the Administrator performs a similar constitutional role to that of a state governor and can be considered the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the Territory.\n\nThe Administrator formally appoints the [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] and the members of the Cabinet after every election.  In all but a few cases, he or she is required by convention to act on the Cabinet's advice.  The Administrator gives [[royal assent]] to all bills passed by the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]].  Although the Governor-General (in practice, the Commonwealth Government) has the power to veto any territorial bill, in practice this right is almost never exercised.\n\nThe office of the ''Deputy of the Administrator'' was created in 1997.\n\nIn 2014, the Governor-General granted current, future and living former Administrators the title of 'The Honourable' for life,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Karen |title=Title Honourable for Administrators of the Northern Territory |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014G01261 |website=Federal Register of Legislation |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=22 May 2019 |date=30 July 2014}}</ref> following the lead of Governors-General and Governors of New South Wales in granting the title.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe present Administrator is [[Vicki O'Halloran]], [[Order of Australia|AO]].<ref>[http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/ NT Office of Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404010528/http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/ |date=2004-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n== South Australia (1863 to 1912) ==\nOn 6 July 1863, land now known as the Northern Territory was annexed to the [[Colony of South Australia]].

He or she performs functions similar to those of a [[Governors of the Australian states|state governor]].\n\nStrictly speaking, the appointment of an Administrator is made by the Governor-General-in-Council, that is, the Governor-General acting on the ''advice'' of the [[Federal Executive Council (Australia)|Commonwealth Government]], rather than the advice of the [[Government of the Northern Territory]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 - SECT 32 Office of Administrator |url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1978425/s32.html |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=22 May 2019|via=[[Austlii]] }}</ref>  The Northern Territory received self-government on 1 July 1978, in accordance with the provisions of the ''[[Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978]] ([[Australian Parliament|Cth]])''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/nta1978425/}}</ref>  Since then, the practice has arisen that in making an appointment the Governor-General-in-Council will act on the ''recommendation'' of the Northern Territory Government.\n\nUnlike an Australian [[Governors of the Australian states|State Governor]], the Administrator is not the ''direct'' representative of the [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen]] in the Territory but is instead appointed by the Queen's representative in the Commonwealth, the Governor-General, to administer the Territory in accordance with the Act. In practice, however, the Administrator performs a similar constitutional role to that of a state governor and can be considered the Queen's ''indirect'' representative in the Territory.\n\nThe Administrator formally appoints the [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]] and the members of the Cabinet after every election.  In all but a few cases, he or she is required by convention to act on the Cabinet's advice.  The Administrator gives [[royal assent]] to all bills passed by the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]].  Although the Governor-General (in practice, the Commonwealth Government) has the power to veto any territorial bill, in practice this right is almost never exercised.\n\nThe office of the ''Deputy of the Administrator'' was created in 1997.\n\nIn 2014, the Governor-General granted current, future and living former Administrators the title of 'The Honourable' for life,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Karen |title=Title Honourable for Administrators of the Northern Territory |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014G01261 |website=Federal Register of Legislation |publisher=Australian Government |accessdate=22 May 2019 |date=30 July 2014}}</ref> following the lead of Governors-General and Governors of New South Wales in granting the title.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe present Administrator is [[Vicki O'Halloran]], [[Order of Australia|AO]].<ref>[http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/ NT Office of Administrator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404010528/http://www.nt.gov.au/administrator/ |date=2004-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n== South Australia (1863 to 1912) ==\nOn 6 July 1863, land now known as the Northern Territory was annexed to the [[Colony of South Australia]].

In colonial times, [[Anglicans]], [[Catholics]] and [[mainline Protestants]], as well as [[Jews]], arrived from [[Europe]]. [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] has been present since the [[Russian Alaska|Russian colonization of Alaska]]. Various [[English dissenters|dissenting Protestants]], who left the [[Church of England]], greatly diversified the religious landscape. The [[Great Awakenings]] gave birth to multiple [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestant]] denominations; membership in [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] churches increased drastically in the [[Second Great Awakening]]. In the 18th century, [[deism]] found support among [[American upper class]]es and thinkers. The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the [[American Revolution]]. New Protestant branches like [[Adventism]] emerged; [[Restorationists]] and other Christians like the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], as well as [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] communities all spread in the 19th century. [[Pentecostalism]] emerged in the early 20th century as a result of the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. [[Scientology]] emerged in the 1950s. [[Unitarian Universalism]] resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the religious share of Christians has decreased, while [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]], and other religions have spread, mainly from immigration. [[Protestantism]], historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in the [[United States]] with the various [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]] having the most adherents. In 2016, Christians represent 73.7% of the total population, 48.9% identifying as [[Protestants]], 23.0% as [[Catholics]], and 1.8% as [[Mormons]], and are followed by people having [[Irreligion|no religion]] with 18.2% of the total population.<ref name=\"Gallup2016religion\">{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx|title=Five Key Findings on Religion in the U.S.|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=23 December 2016|work=Gallup|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-us}}</ref> [[Judaism]] is the second-largest religion in the U.S., practiced by 2.1% of the population, followed by [[Islam]] with 0.8%.

Since then, the Catholic church has founded hundreds of other colleges and universities, along with thousands of primary and secondary schools.

Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37% and in Texas from 23% to 32%.\n# Overall the 1990\u20132008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nThe table below shows the religious affiliations among the [[ethnic]]ities in the United States, according to the [[Pew Forum]] 2014 survey.<ref name=\"pew2014\" /> People of [[African American|Black]] ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion, with 80% percent being Christians.

In colonial times, [[Anglicans]], [[Catholics]] and [[mainline Protestants]], as well as [[Jews]], arrived from [[Europe]]. [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] has been present since the [[Russian Alaska|Russian colonization of Alaska]]. Various [[English dissenters|dissenting Protestants]], who left the [[Church of England]], greatly diversified the religious landscape. The [[Great Awakenings]] gave birth to multiple [[Evangelicalism in the United States|evangelical Protestant]] denominations; membership in [[Methodist]] and [[Baptist]] churches increased drastically in the [[Second Great Awakening]]. In the 18th century, [[deism]] found support among [[American upper class]]es and thinkers. The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], splitting from the Church of England, came into being in the [[American Revolution]]. New Protestant branches like [[Adventism]] emerged; [[Restorationists]] and other Christians like the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Churches of Christ]] and [[Church of Christ, Scientist]], as well as [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Universalist]] communities all spread in the 19th century. [[Pentecostalism]] emerged in the early 20th century as a result of the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. [[Scientology]] emerged in the 1950s. [[Unitarian Universalism]] resulted from the merge of Unitarian and Universalist churches in the 20th century. Since the 1990s, the religious share of Christians has decreased, while [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]], and other religions have spread, mainly from immigration. [[Protestantism]], historically dominant, ceased to be the religious category of the majority in the early 2010s.\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in the [[United States]] with the various [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]] having the most adherents. In 2016, Christians represent 73.7% of the total population, 48.9% identifying as [[Protestants]], 23.0% as [[Catholics]], and 1.8% as [[Mormons]], and are followed by people having [[Irreligion|no religion]] with 18.2% of the total population.<ref name=\"Gallup2016religion\">{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/200186/five-key-findings-religion.aspx|title=Five Key Findings on Religion in the U.S.|last=Newport|first=Frank|date=23 December 2016|work=Gallup|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-us}}</ref> [[Judaism]] is the second-largest religion in the U.S., practiced by 2.1% of the population, followed by [[Islam]] with 0.8%.

Religious switching along with Hispanic immigration has significantly changed the religious profile of some states and regions. Between 1990 and 2008, the Catholic population proportion of the New England states fell from 50% to 36% and in New York fell from 44% to 37%, while it rose in California from 29% to 37% and in Texas from 23% to 32%.\n# Overall the 1990\u20132008 ARIS time series shows that changes in religious self-identification in the first decade of the 21st century have been moderate in comparison to the 1990s, which was a period of significant shifts in the religious composition of the United States.\n\n==Ethnicity==\nThe table below shows the religious affiliations among the [[ethnic]]ities in the United States, according to the [[Pew Forum]] 2014 survey.<ref name=\"pew2014\" /> People of [[African American|Black]] ethnicity were most likely to be part of a formal religion, with 80% percent being Christians.

Daoud Khan's irredentist foreign policy to reunite the Pashtun homeland caused much tension with Pakistan, a nation that allied itself with the United States. Daoud Khan's irredentist policy was fueled by his desire to unite his divided country. To unite his divided country, Daoud Khan started emulating policies of Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and for that he needed a popular cause (a Pashtun homeland) to unite the Afghan people divided along the tribal lines and a modern, well equipped Afghan army which would be used to surpass anyone who would oppose the Afghan government.<ref name=\"unite\"/> Daoud Khan's policy to annex Pashtun areas of Pakistan had also angered Non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"abcclio\"/> Similarly, Pashtun population in Pakistan were also not interested in having their areas being annexed by Afghanistan.<ref name=\"unhappy\"/> In 1951, the United States's State Department urged Afghanistan to drop its claim against Pakistan and accept the Durrand Line.<ref>Rubin, Barnett R.

Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85043-857-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86 86\u201388]|url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86}}</ref>\n\n===Initiation of the insurgency===\n{{Main|Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Pakistan\u2013Soviet Union relations}} {{See also|Adolph Dubs|l1=Kidnapping and assassination of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0413\u0421-17 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0410\u0417-66.jpeg|thumb|left|Soviet infantry at the time of deployment]]\n\nAfghanistan, under the regime of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], had hostile relations with both [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=giwiAwAAQBAJ&q=To+change+the+attitude+of+Daoud+Khan+who+was+known+to+be+pro-Moscow%2C+anti-Shah+and+anti-Pakistan#v=snippet&q=To%20change%20the%20attitude%20of%20Daoud%20Khan%20who%20was%20known%20to%20be%20pro-Moscow%2C%20anti-Shah%20and%20anti-Pakistan&f=false|title=The Middle East in World Politics (Routledge Revivals)|last=Ayoob|first=Mohammed|publisher=Routledge|page=147|date=2014|isbn=9781317811282}}</ref><ref name=\"unite\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC|title=Afghanistan's Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|pages=12, 45|isbn=9780817977931}}</ref> Like all previous Afghan rulers since 1901, Daoud Khan also wanted to emulate Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and unite his divided country.

Supposedly, two of Amin's guards killed the former president Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin, himself, was suspected to be a CIA agent. The latter, however, is still disputed with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union who would arrive in Afghanistan. Soviet General [[Vasily Zaplatin]], a political advisor of [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of President Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization.

However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May\u2013December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government; the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics; Taraki's murder and replacement by Amin, who the Soviets feared could become aligned with the Americans and provide them with a new strategic position after the loss of Iran; and the deteriorating ties with the United States after [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO's two-track missile deployment decision]] and the failure of Congress to ratify the [[SALT II]] treaty, creating the impression that d\u00e9tente was \"already effectively dead.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote in 1989: \"The simplest explanation is probably the best.

The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.<ref name=\"Report from Afghanistan\">[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret</ref>\n\n[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]\n\nTo complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]].

Perhaps the most notable of these groups was the [[Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan]] (SAMA), which launched skilled guerilla attacks and controlled some territory north of Kabul in the early years of the war. The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders [[Faiz Ahmad]] and [[Mulavi Dawood]] in 1986, both committed by the [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] mujahideen faction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|left|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]\n\nIn the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of \"commander\". It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, \"commander\" was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.\n\nAfghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.<ref name=\"loc1\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979\u201392 \u2013 Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n[[File:August 1985 Muja.jpg|thumb|Three mujahideen in [[Asmar]], 1985]]\n\nRoy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.<ref>The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'</ref> But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower\u2014customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest\u2014proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.<ref name=\"loc1\"/>\n\nMujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n\nThe mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]\n\nThey concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.\n\nMujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.\n\nIn May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government.\n\n===Media reaction===\n{{quote box |align=right|width=30%|quote = Those hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God. \u2013 Journalist [[Rob Schultheis]], 1992<ref>Schultheis, Rob. \"Night Letters Inside Wartime Afghanistan\", 1992. p. 155</ref><ref name=\"pete\">[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], ''[[Holy War, Inc.]]'', 2001</ref>}}\n\nInternational journalistic perception of the war varied.

Kaplan note that \"none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war\",{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} and television cameramen venturing to follow the mujahideen \"trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=14}} In October 1984 the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told [[Agence France Presse]] \"that journalists traveling with the mujahidin 'will be killed.

During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\nUnder Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'\u00e9tat, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.\n\nThe decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219</ref> In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grau |first=Lester |authorlink2=Ali Ahmad Jalali|last2=Jalali |first2=Ali Ahmad|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations.

Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] policies. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with the U.S. in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}</ref> At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}</ref> The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}</ref> This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy \u2013 from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.\n\nIn the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.\n\nBy mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.\n\nIn September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down two Iranian [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1J Cobra]], which had intruded in Afghan airspace.<ref>\"The Aviation History\", Florian Ion Petrescu, Relly Victoria Petrescu, 2012, p. 82</ref>\n\n''[[Operation Magistral]]'' was one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets, a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between [[Gardez]] and [[Khost]].

It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 644461 First stage in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A column of Soviet BTR armored personnel carriers departing from Afghanistan.]]\n\nIn November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of \"national reconciliation,\" devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInformal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]]. The United Nations set up a special [[United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan|Mission]] to oversee the process. In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal. On July 20, 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Lt. Gen. [[Boris Gromov]], who, at the time, was the commander of the [[40th Army]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong other things the Geneva accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal.

In order to counter the Soviet jets, United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles and thus required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons. On 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 intercepted two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22M3K]] belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. On 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged garrisons like the one in [[Khost province|Khost]]. On 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an [[Antonov An-26|An-26]] cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft. In the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transports helicopter, another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, two PAF F-16 ambushed four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] who were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that F-16 was shot down by Mig-23, though the Russian Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nOn 8 August 1988, Colonel [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was leading a group of [[Sukhoi Su-25]] fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in [[Miramshah]], Pakistan.

A month later, around twelve [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s and the sidewinder fired by one of F-16 damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to reach back home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both the Mig-23 were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft was lost on that day. The last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988. One Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by Pakistani airforce jet.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\">{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/pakistan%E2%80%99s-f-16s-battled-soviet-jets%E2%80%94and-shot-down-future-vice-president-russia-47717|title=Pakistan's F-16s Battled Soviet Jets\u2014and Shot Down the Future Vice President of Russia|date=16 March 2019|work=National Interest|last=Roblin|first=Sebastian|accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, an Su-25, and an An-24 while lost only one F-16.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=88JvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=PAF%20F-16s%20downed%20several%20MiG-23s%2C%20Su-22s%2C%20an%20Su-25%2C%20and%20an%20An-24.&f=false|title=Air Warfare in the Missile Age|last=Nordeen|first=Lon O.|accessdate=20 December 2019|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, 2010|page=170|isbn=9781588342829|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Atrocities==\n\n===Massacres===\nAmerican professor [[Samuel Totten]],<ref name=Totten/> Australian professor [[Paul R.

China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in [[Xinjiang]]. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E.

The intervention, along with other events, such as the [[Iranian revolution]] and the US hostage stand-off that accompanied it, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, contributed to the volatility of the Middle East and South Asian regions in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was sharply divided between those who believed the Soviet deployment to be a legitimate police action and others who considered the deployment an illegal invasion.

The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/> The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from \"tactical initiative\", essential in counter insurgency, because it \"tended to upset operational timing\".<ref name=Grau-201/>\n* The Russians used large-scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants.

The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/>\n* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces.

In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army's defeat. In Russia the war created a cleavage between the party and the military, changing the perceptions of leaders about the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in [[Prague Spring#Invasion|Czechoslovakia in 1968]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]], and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany in 1953]]). As the war was viewed as \"a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans\", outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afghansti), which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press and media, which continued under [[glasnost]].<ref name=REUVENY-1999/>\n\n===Civil war===\n{{Main|Conflict in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989\u20131992)}}\n[[File:T-54A and T-55 at Bagram Air Base.jpg|thumb|Two Soviet [[T-55]] tanks left by the Soviet army during their withdrawal lie rusting in a field near [[Bagram Airfield]], in 2002]]\n\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992.\n\nCivil war between the Afghan army and mujahideen continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the chaos and civil war of the 1990s.<ref>\"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0920/p1s3-wosc.html/(page)/4 Life under Taliban cuts two ways]\". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. September 20, 2001</ref> Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\nAccording to Russian publicist [[Andrey Karaulov]], the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia's refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] and his Uzbek [[militia]], in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah's control of the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.\n\nGrain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_TmRaZQYDZcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Afghanistan Business Intelligence Report|last=Staff|first=Global Investment and Business Center, Inc|last2=Staff|first2=International Business Publications|date=May 2000|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739725009}}</ref> Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline.

Daoud Khan's irredentist foreign policy to reunite the Pashtun homeland caused much tension with Pakistan, a nation that allied itself with the United States. Daoud Khan's irredentist policy was fueled by his desire to unite his divided country. To unite his divided country, Daoud Khan started emulating policies of Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and for that he needed a popular cause (a Pashtun homeland) to unite the Afghan people divided along the tribal lines and a modern, well equipped Afghan army which would be used to surpass anyone who would oppose the Afghan government.<ref name=\"unite\"/> Daoud Khan's policy to annex Pashtun areas of Pakistan had also angered Non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"abcclio\"/> Similarly, Pashtun population in Pakistan were also not interested in having their areas being annexed by Afghanistan.<ref name=\"unhappy\"/> In 1951, the United States's State Department urged Afghanistan to drop its claim against Pakistan and accept the Durrand Line.<ref>Rubin, Barnett R.

Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85043-857-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86 86\u201388]|url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86}}</ref>\n\n===Initiation of the insurgency===\n{{Main|Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Pakistan\u2013Soviet Union relations}} {{See also|Adolph Dubs|l1=Kidnapping and assassination of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0413\u0421-17 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0410\u0417-66.jpeg|thumb|left|Soviet infantry at the time of deployment]]\n\nAfghanistan, under the regime of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], had hostile relations with both [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=giwiAwAAQBAJ&q=To+change+the+attitude+of+Daoud+Khan+who+was+known+to+be+pro-Moscow%2C+anti-Shah+and+anti-Pakistan#v=snippet&q=To%20change%20the%20attitude%20of%20Daoud%20Khan%20who%20was%20known%20to%20be%20pro-Moscow%2C%20anti-Shah%20and%20anti-Pakistan&f=false|title=The Middle East in World Politics (Routledge Revivals)|last=Ayoob|first=Mohammed|publisher=Routledge|page=147|date=2014|isbn=9781317811282}}</ref><ref name=\"unite\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC|title=Afghanistan's Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|pages=12, 45|isbn=9780817977931}}</ref> Like all previous Afghan rulers since 1901, Daoud Khan also wanted to emulate Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and unite his divided country.

Supposedly, two of Amin's guards killed the former president Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin, himself, was suspected to be a CIA agent. The latter, however, is still disputed with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union who would arrive in Afghanistan. Soviet General [[Vasily Zaplatin]], a political advisor of [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of President Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization.

However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May\u2013December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government; the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics; Taraki's murder and replacement by Amin, who the Soviets feared could become aligned with the Americans and provide them with a new strategic position after the loss of Iran; and the deteriorating ties with the United States after [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO's two-track missile deployment decision]] and the failure of Congress to ratify the [[SALT II]] treaty, creating the impression that d\u00e9tente was \"already effectively dead.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote in 1989: \"The simplest explanation is probably the best.

The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.<ref name=\"Report from Afghanistan\">[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret</ref>\n\n[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]\n\nTo complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]].

Perhaps the most notable of these groups was the [[Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan]] (SAMA), which launched skilled guerilla attacks and controlled some territory north of Kabul in the early years of the war. The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders [[Faiz Ahmad]] and [[Mulavi Dawood]] in 1986, both committed by the [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] mujahideen faction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|left|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]\n\nIn the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of \"commander\". It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, \"commander\" was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.\n\nAfghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.<ref name=\"loc1\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979\u201392 \u2013 Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n[[File:August 1985 Muja.jpg|thumb|Three mujahideen in [[Asmar]], 1985]]\n\nRoy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.<ref>The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'</ref> But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower\u2014customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest\u2014proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.<ref name=\"loc1\"/>\n\nMujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n\nThe mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]\n\nThey concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.\n\nMujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.\n\nIn May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government.\n\n===Media reaction===\n{{quote box |align=right|width=30%|quote = Those hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God. \u2013 Journalist [[Rob Schultheis]], 1992<ref>Schultheis, Rob. \"Night Letters Inside Wartime Afghanistan\", 1992. p. 155</ref><ref name=\"pete\">[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], ''[[Holy War, Inc.]]'', 2001</ref>}}\n\nInternational journalistic perception of the war varied.

Kaplan note that \"none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war\",{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} and television cameramen venturing to follow the mujahideen \"trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=14}} In October 1984 the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told [[Agence France Presse]] \"that journalists traveling with the mujahidin 'will be killed.

During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\nUnder Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'\u00e9tat, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.\n\nThe decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219</ref> In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grau |first=Lester |authorlink2=Ali Ahmad Jalali|last2=Jalali |first2=Ali Ahmad|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations.

Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] policies. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with the U.S. in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}</ref> At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}</ref> The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}</ref> This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy \u2013 from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.\n\nIn the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.\n\nBy mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.\n\nIn September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down two Iranian [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1J Cobra]], which had intruded in Afghan airspace.<ref>\"The Aviation History\", Florian Ion Petrescu, Relly Victoria Petrescu, 2012, p. 82</ref>\n\n''[[Operation Magistral]]'' was one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets, a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between [[Gardez]] and [[Khost]].

It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 644461 First stage in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A column of Soviet BTR armored personnel carriers departing from Afghanistan.]]\n\nIn November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of \"national reconciliation,\" devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInformal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]]. The United Nations set up a special [[United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan|Mission]] to oversee the process. In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal. On July 20, 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Lt. Gen. [[Boris Gromov]], who, at the time, was the commander of the [[40th Army]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong other things the Geneva accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal.

In order to counter the Soviet jets, United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles and thus required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons. On 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 intercepted two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22M3K]] belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. On 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged garrisons like the one in [[Khost province|Khost]]. On 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an [[Antonov An-26|An-26]] cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft. In the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transports helicopter, another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, two PAF F-16 ambushed four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] who were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that F-16 was shot down by Mig-23, though the Russian Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nOn 8 August 1988, Colonel [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was leading a group of [[Sukhoi Su-25]] fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in [[Miramshah]], Pakistan.

A month later, around twelve [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s and the sidewinder fired by one of F-16 damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to reach back home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both the Mig-23 were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft was lost on that day. The last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988. One Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by Pakistani airforce jet.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\">{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/pakistan%E2%80%99s-f-16s-battled-soviet-jets%E2%80%94and-shot-down-future-vice-president-russia-47717|title=Pakistan's F-16s Battled Soviet Jets\u2014and Shot Down the Future Vice President of Russia|date=16 March 2019|work=National Interest|last=Roblin|first=Sebastian|accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, an Su-25, and an An-24 while lost only one F-16.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=88JvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=PAF%20F-16s%20downed%20several%20MiG-23s%2C%20Su-22s%2C%20an%20Su-25%2C%20and%20an%20An-24.&f=false|title=Air Warfare in the Missile Age|last=Nordeen|first=Lon O.|accessdate=20 December 2019|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, 2010|page=170|isbn=9781588342829|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Atrocities==\n\n===Massacres===\nAmerican professor [[Samuel Totten]],<ref name=Totten/> Australian professor [[Paul R.

China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in [[Xinjiang]]. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E.

The intervention, along with other events, such as the [[Iranian revolution]] and the US hostage stand-off that accompanied it, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, contributed to the volatility of the Middle East and South Asian regions in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was sharply divided between those who believed the Soviet deployment to be a legitimate police action and others who considered the deployment an illegal invasion.

The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/> The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from \"tactical initiative\", essential in counter insurgency, because it \"tended to upset operational timing\".<ref name=Grau-201/>\n* The Russians used large-scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants.

The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/>\n* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces.

In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army's defeat. In Russia the war created a cleavage between the party and the military, changing the perceptions of leaders about the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in [[Prague Spring#Invasion|Czechoslovakia in 1968]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]], and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany in 1953]]). As the war was viewed as \"a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans\", outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afghansti), which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press and media, which continued under [[glasnost]].<ref name=REUVENY-1999/>\n\n===Civil war===\n{{Main|Conflict in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989\u20131992)}}\n[[File:T-54A and T-55 at Bagram Air Base.jpg|thumb|Two Soviet [[T-55]] tanks left by the Soviet army during their withdrawal lie rusting in a field near [[Bagram Airfield]], in 2002]]\n\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992.\n\nCivil war between the Afghan army and mujahideen continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the chaos and civil war of the 1990s.<ref>\"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0920/p1s3-wosc.html/(page)/4 Life under Taliban cuts two ways]\". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. September 20, 2001</ref> Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\nAccording to Russian publicist [[Andrey Karaulov]], the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia's refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] and his Uzbek [[militia]], in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah's control of the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.\n\nGrain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_TmRaZQYDZcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Afghanistan Business Intelligence Report|last=Staff|first=Global Investment and Business Center, Inc|last2=Staff|first2=International Business Publications|date=May 2000|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739725009}}</ref> Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline.
