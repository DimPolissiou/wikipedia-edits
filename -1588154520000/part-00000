more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

more expensive|work=[[Ars Technica]]|last=Amadeo|first=Ron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n==Specifications==\n===Design===\nAs with previous OnePlus phones, the 8 and 8 Pro use an anodized aluminum frame and curved [[Gorilla Glass]] on both the front and back. Both have a circular cutout in the upper-left hand corner for the front-facing camera; on the 8 Pro this replaces the pop-up camera used on the 7 Pro and 7T Pro. The camera module is similar to that of the 7 Pro and 7T Pro, protruding slightly from the back panel. On the 8, the dual-LED flash is located below, while on the 8 Pro, the telephoto camera, laser autofocus and dual-LED flash are all located to the left of the module. The 8 and 8 Pro are the first water-resistant OnePlus phones, rated at [[IP Code|IP68]]. All 8 Pro models have water resistance, although for the 8 it is present only on carrier models. Both will be available in Onyx Black (glossy) and Glacial Green (matte), while the 8 Pro has its own Ultramarine Blue (matte) finish. The 8 has two additional colors, a Polar Silver (matte) finish exclusive to the Verizon model,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date|title=The OnePlus 8 5G is coming to Verizon for $799|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Welch|first=Chris|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> and an Interstellar Glow (glossy) finish exclusive to the T-Mobile model.\n\n===Hardware===\nBoth the 8 and 8 Pro use the Snapdragon 865 processor with the [[Adreno]] 650 GPU, and will be available with either 128 or 256&nbsp;GB of non-expandable [[Universal Flash Storage|UFS]] 3.0 storage. Both have 8 or 12&nbsp;GB of RAM; the 8 has [[LPDDR4X]] and the 8 Pro has faster, more efficient [[LPDDR5]]. [[AMOLED]] panels with [[HDR10+]] support are used on both phones. The 8's display is carried over from the 7T, a 6.55-inch (166.4mm) [[1080p]] screen with a 20:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and a 90&nbsp;Hz [[refresh rate]]. The 8 Pro's display has a 6.78-inch (172.2mm) [[1440p]] screen with a 19.8:9 aspect ratio and a 120&nbsp;Hz refresh rate. The display on the 8 Pro has an Adaptive Display feature, similar to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s True Tone, and an MEMC (Motion Estimation, Motion Compensation) option akin to \"motion smoothening\" on high-end TVs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_8_pro_hands_on-review-2098p2.php|title=OnePlus 8 Pro hands-on review: Design and display|website=GSMArena|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> MEMC works with supported apps and games, and analyzes footage of at least 24 frames-per-second and [[Motion interpolation|interpolate]] frames to make the footage playback in what looks to be a higher frame rate. The 8 Pro is also one of the first smartphones able to display 1 billion colors using a [[Color depth#Deep color (30/36/48-bit)|30-bit]] panel. Both have stereo speakers with active noise cancellation, although the audio jack is still omitted. The battery capacity has been increased to 4300 mAh on the 8 and 4510 mAh on the 8 Pro. Fast charging is supported at 30W, and the 8 Pro supports 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro. OnePlus also claims that the 8 Pro uses [[Nokia OZO]] audio recording technology for its triple microphone array, which is used for the Audio 3D, Audio Zoom and Audio Windscreen camera features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsmarena.com/the_oneplus_8_pro_packs_nokia_ozo_microphone_tech-news-42665.php|title=The OnePlus 8 Pro packs Nokia OZO microphone tech|website=GSMArena|date=15 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> The front camera on both uses a 16 MP sensor.\n\n===Software===\nThe 8 and 8 Pro run on [[OxygenOS]] 10, which is based on [[Android 10]]. \n\n===Network compatibility===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Model\n!GSM\nBands\n!CDMA\nBands\n!UMTS\nBands\n!LTE\nBands\n!5G\nBands\n|-\n|7T\n|rowspan=\"2\"|850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900&nbsp;MHz\n|rowspan=\"2\"|BC0, BC1\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 19\n|rowspan=\"2\"|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 66, 71\nTDD: 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48 \n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n\nmmWave: 257, 258, 260, 261\n|-\n|7T Pro\n|FDD: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 28, 66, 71\nTDD: 41, 78, 79\n|}\nConnectivity options have been improved with the implementation of 5G technology for all models, however only the Verizon '''OnePlus 8 5G UW''' model will be compatible with ultra-fast millimeter-wave networks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/the-fastest-oneplus-8-5g-variant-is-an-exclusive-with-verizon/|title=The fastest OnePlus 8 5G variant is an exclusive with Verizon|work=[[CNET]]|last1=Cheng|first1=Roger|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Eli|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> Verizon and T-Mobile will sell the 8 but not the 8 Pro, however the 8 Pro will still work on their networks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219152/oneplus-8-pro-buy-order-how-to-price-release-date-carriers|title=How to buy the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro|work=[[The Verge]]|last=Faulkner|first=Cameron|date=14 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nBoth the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro were met with generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the design, display, performance and battery life.

As from 2018, the city and its surrounding area had an estimated population of 2,768,400.<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html</ref> The city sits on the estuary of [[Wouri River]] and its climate is [[tropical]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Douala|History of Cameroon|Kamerun}}\n\nThe first [[Europe]]ans to visit the area were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of [[Wouri River]] was known as the Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the [[Duala language]]. During the 18th century it was the center of the [[transatlantic slave trade]].\n\nIn 1826<ref>Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952.</ref> Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River).\n\n[[File:SMS OLGA bei der Beschie\u00dfung von Hickorytown (Duala), Kamerun, Dezember 1884.jpg|thumb|The German corvette {{SMS|Olga}} at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Duala) on December 21, 1884]]\nBetween 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.<ref> Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Douala Douala], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>\nThe colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, [[Alfred Saker]] organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to [[Bu\u00e9a]].\n\nIn 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\">Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le (2010). ''Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar''. \u00c9pinal: Association VAA, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.<ref> Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176</ref> In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn 1960 Cameroon became independent and it became a federal republic, with its capital in [[Yaound\u00e9]]. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972 the federal republic became a unified state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and [[Multi-party system|multi-partitism]] grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (''ville morte'') during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.<ref>Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), ''Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge''. Douala: Editions l'Etincelle d'Afrique.</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nWith the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 15th century, the area was known as ''Rio dos Camar\u00f5es''.

It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919. Many of the Ijaw (Njo) natives migrated to the Niger Delta in Nigeria during the Portuguese era.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Pont sur le Wouri.JPG|thumb|Bridge over the Wouri River]]\nThe city is located on the banks of the [[Wouri River]], the two sides linked by [[Wouri River#Bridge|Bonaberi Bridge]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nDouala features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''), with relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, though the city experiences somewhat cooler temperatures in July and August.

Akwa is Douala's business district and Bonanjo its administrative district. ''Plateau Joss'' is the name used historically for the current district of Akwa. The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix \"bona\" means \"descendant of\".\n* [[Ball, Douala|Bali]], housing area located near Bonanjo administrative area.\n* [[B\u00e9panda]] is a very densely populated  neighbourhood. It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with lots of inhabitants coming from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of the Cameroon telecommunications are located there.\n* [[Deido]] is a historical neighbourhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point De\u00efdo and the symbol of the city \u201cthe Njounjou\u201d (\u201cthe monster\u201d).\n* [[Bonaberi]] is located on the right of Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighborhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country.\n* [[Bonapriso]] is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including  commercial galleries, restaurants and shops.\n* [[Bonanjo]] is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city\n* [[Bonamoussadi]] is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs.\n* [[Kotto, Douala|Kotto]] is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing  middle and upper classes of the city.\n* [[New Bell, Douala|New Bell]] is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss. It is known for housing since then newcomers in the city from all parts of the country and even from abroad (mainly west Africa). It today a very populous neighbourhood with very tough conditions. Two of the main markets of the city (Central market and March\u00e9 Nkololoun) are in the area.\n* [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]] is a vast area in the eastern part of the city. It is a mixed area including  many neighborhoods (some wealthier than others) such as Logbaba, Ndogpassi, Cit\u00e9 des Palmiers, PK 8 and many others. It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Ars&Urbis International Workshop - Emiliano Gandolfi 176.JPG|300px|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Kings Bell]]]]\nAccording to Jacques Soulillou,<ref>Jacques Soulillou (1989), ''Douala, un si\u00e8cle en images''. Paris: L'Harmattan, p. 9.</ref> historical images of Douala document the areas of Akwa (Plateau Joss) and the port between 1860 and 1960, while the districts of Bonaberi, Deido and New Bell have almost no images.

The plan included a [[Former general Hospital of Douala|hospital]], the [[Old German government headquarters in Douala|governor residency]], the palace of justice, the [[Former police station of Douala|police station]], administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the [[Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House in Douala|Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House]]). The [[Bonakouamouang Chimney]] also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the [[Villa Mandessi Bell]] was begun. In 1905 the [[Palace of the Kings Bell|palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell]] (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell).\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the [[Chamber of Commerce (Douala 1927-1928)|chamber of commerce]], the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|new palace of justice]], the new railway station, the [[vault of the Kings Bell]] and the catholic [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Douala|cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul]] were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the [[Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa]] was constructed. In 1947 the [[Temple of the Centenary in Douala|Temple of the Centenary]] was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Dani\u00e8le Diwouta-Kotto,<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was  launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been  produced in Douala.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nThe publication ''Suites architecturales''<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show-room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, [[Union Bank of Cameroon]], Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA-SCB, [[doual'art|espace doual'art]], and Orange Flagship. The [[Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda]] was built in 1990.\n\nAlong the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style [[patisserie]]s; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and nearby [[mangrove]] swamps.  Many of these are frequented by the city's large [[expatriate]] population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the [[petroleum industry]].\n\n== Culture ==\n* [[Douala Maritime Museum]], Museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Douala. The building is shaped like a boat (however the museum only occupy 400 m2 of the building). It is located in the administrative area [[Bonanjo]]\n* [[Doual'art]], an art gallery/center\n* [[La Nouvelle Libert\u00e9]], a 12m piece from [[Joseph Francis Sum\u00e9gn\u00e9]] inaugurated in 2007. A permanent monumental sculpture made with recycled material located at a main roundabout in Douala. It is 12 meters high with a wingspan of 5 meters.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Douala]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Integrity for All]] ([[Christian Missionary Fellowship and Associated Churches]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]).<ref> J.

In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba.\n\nThe city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the [[University of Douala]].<ref>Presidential act n\u00b0 93/030 of 19 January 1993.</ref>There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an [[aviation school]] called [[CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Gare de Bessengu\u00e9 2.JPG|thumb|Gare de Bessengu\u00e9, Douala's train station]]\nDouala is linked by [[Camrail|rail]] to [[Yaound\u00e9]], [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Kumba]] and [[Nkongsamba]]. Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[tram]] network is planned for Douala, with the first line projected to open in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/douala-tram-project-poised-to-launch.html|title=Douala tram project poised to launch|date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Douala International Airport]] is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Istanbul]]. Regional and continental destinations include [[Abidjan]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Lagos]], [[Malabo]], and [[Nairobi]]. The airport is the busiest in the [[CEMAC]] area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure.\n\nThe [[seaport]] has {{convert|8.5|m|abbr=off}} of [[Draft (ship)|draft]].\n\n== Economy ==\nDouala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nMain economic parameters are:\n\n*'''GDP:''' $42.2 billion (2006 est.):\n* '''GDP growth rate''': 4.1% (2006 est.)\n* '''Exports-partners''': Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005)\n*'''Imports - partners''': France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005)\n\n=== Wealth and poverty ===\nEven though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cameroon.html|title=Cameroon|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== People ==\n* [[Louis Brody]] (1892\u20131951), German actor\n* [[Jacques Kuoh-Moukouri]] (1909-2002), Cameroonian author and diplomat\n* Prince [[Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell]] (1927\u20132012), chief of Douala<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameroun : qui \u00e9tait Son Altesse Royale le Prince Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell ?|url=http://www.afrik.com/cameroun-qui-etait-son-altesse-royale-le-prince-rene-douala-manga-bell|website=afrik.com|language=fr|date=4 January 2013}}.</ref> \n* [[Francis Bebey]] (1929\u20132002), author \n* [[Manu Dibango]] (1933\u20132020), musician, saxophonist and singer, world jazz, ethno-jazz.\n* [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kuoh-Moukouri]] (1938\u2013), feminist and author \n* [[Jean-Pierre Dikongu\u00e9 Pipa]] (1940\u2013), cineast\n* [[Patrick Baudry]] (1946\u2013), second French [[astronaut]] and first astronaut of an African country\n* [[Nton\u00e8 Nton\u00e8 Fritz]] (1954\u2013), politician\n* [[\u00c9lise Mballa]] (1961\u2013), dancer\n* [[Maka Kotto]] (1961\u2013), Canadian politician\n* [[Ang\u00e8le Etoundi Essamba]] (1962\u2013), photograph\n* [[Petit Pays]] (1967\u2013), singer, dancer, author\n* [[Blaise Bang]] (1968\u2013), artist\n* [[Hemley Boum]] (1973\u2013), writer\n* [[Achillek\u00e0 Komguem]] (1973\u2013), artist\n* [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pierre Wom\u00e9]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Killamel]] (1984\u2013), rap dancer\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Mang]] (1984\u2013), sport\n* Vital Mevengue (1978\u2014)\n* [[Paul-Georges Ntep]] (1992\u2013), footballer\n* [[Samuel Eto'o]] (1981\u2013), footballer\n* [[Narcisse Mouelle Kombi]](1962\u2013 ), writer and politician\n* [[Christian Ngan]] (1983\u2013 ), entrepreneur, business man and financier\n* [[Marc Kibong Mbamba]] (1988\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pascal Siakam]] (1994\u2013 ), basketball player - 2019 NBA Champion\n* [[Ibrahim Amadou]] (1993\u2013), footballer\n* [[Fidele Ntie-Kang]] (1976-), chemist\n* [[Elsa Kwin]], singer and competitor on [[The Voice Afrique Francophone]]\n* [[Kareyce Fotso]] (2010-), Cameroonian singer\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nDoula is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Strasbourg]], France\n*{{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Akhisar]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|Senegal}} [[Dakar]], Senegal\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia]], United States\n*{{flagicon|Namibia}} [[Windhoek]],  Namibia\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Cameroon]]\n* [[Timeline of Douala]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|Timeline of Douala#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Douala}}\n* {{in lang|en}} Brooke, James (1987). \"Informal Capitalism Grows in Cameroon.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

It is also the capital of Cameroon's [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region]]. Home to Central Africa's largest [[port]] and its major international airport, [[Douala International Airport]] (DLA), it is the commercial and economic capital of Cameroon and the entire [[Economic Community of Central African States|CEMAC]] region comprising Gabon, Congo, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Cameroon. Consequently, it handles most of the country's major exports, such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]], timber, metals and fruits. As from 2018, the city and its surrounding area had an estimated population of 2,768,400.<ref>http://citypopulation.de/Cameroon-Cities.html</ref> The city sits on the estuary of [[Wouri River]] and its climate is [[tropical]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Douala|History of Cameroon|Kamerun}}\n\nThe first [[Europe]]ans to visit the area were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of [[Wouri River]] was known as the Rio dos Camar\u00f5es (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the [[Duala language]]. During the 18th century it was the center of the [[transatlantic slave trade]].\n\nIn 1826<ref>Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952.</ref> Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River).\n\n[[File:SMS OLGA bei der Beschie\u00dfung von Hickorytown (Duala), Kamerun, Dezember 1884.jpg|thumb|The German corvette {{SMS|Olga}} at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Duala) on December 21, 1884]]\nBetween 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.<ref> Britannica,\n[https://www.britannica.com/place/Douala Douala], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>\nThe colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, [[Alfred Saker]] organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to [[Bu\u00e9a]].\n\nIn 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\">Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le (2010). ''Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar''. \u00c9pinal: Association VAA, p. 42.</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]] in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs.\n\nFrom 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.<ref> Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176</ref> In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn 1960 Cameroon became independent and it became a federal republic, with its capital in [[Yaound\u00e9]]. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972 the federal republic became a unified state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nIn the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and [[Multi-party system|multi-partitism]] grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (''ville morte'') during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.<ref>Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), ''Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge''. Douala: Editions l'Etincelle d'Afrique.</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nWith the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 15th century, the area was known as ''Rio dos Camar\u00f5es''. Before coming under [[Germany|German]] rule in 1884,<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Cameroon and the German Lake Chad Railway|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/640|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> the town was also known as '''Cameroons Town'''; thereafter it became '''Kamerunstadt''' (\"Cameroon City\"), the capital of [[German Kamerun]].  It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919. Many of the Ijaw (Njo) natives migrated to the Niger Delta in Nigeria during the Portuguese era.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Pont sur le Wouri.JPG|thumb|Bridge over the Wouri River]]\nThe city is located on the banks of the [[Wouri River]], the two sides linked by [[Wouri River#Bridge|Bonaberi Bridge]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nDouala features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Am''), with relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, though the city experiences somewhat cooler temperatures in July and August.

The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix \"bona\" means \"descendant of\".\n* [[Ball, Douala|Bali]], housing area located near Bonanjo administrative area.\n* [[B\u00e9panda]] is a very densely populated  neighbourhood. It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with lots of inhabitants coming from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of the Cameroon telecommunications are located there.\n* [[Deido]] is a historical neighbourhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point De\u00efdo and the symbol of the city \u201cthe Njounjou\u201d (\u201cthe monster\u201d).\n* [[Bonaberi]] is located on the right of Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighborhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country.\n* [[Bonapriso]] is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including  commercial galleries, restaurants and shops.\n* [[Bonanjo]] is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city\n* [[Bonamoussadi]] is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs.\n* [[Kotto, Douala|Kotto]] is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing  middle and upper classes of the city.\n* [[New Bell, Douala|New Bell]] is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss. It is known for housing since then newcomers in the city from all parts of the country and even from abroad (mainly west Africa). It today a very populous neighbourhood with very tough conditions. Two of the main markets of the city (Central market and March\u00e9 Nkololoun) are in the area.\n* [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]] is a vast area in the eastern part of the city. It is a mixed area including  many neighborhoods (some wealthier than others) such as Logbaba, Ndogpassi, Cit\u00e9 des Palmiers, PK 8 and many others. It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Ars&Urbis International Workshop - Emiliano Gandolfi 176.JPG|300px|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Kings Bell]]]]\nAccording to Jacques Soulillou,<ref>Jacques Soulillou (1989), ''Douala, un si\u00e8cle en images''. Paris: L'Harmattan, p. 9.</ref> historical images of Douala document the areas of Akwa (Plateau Joss) and the port between 1860 and 1960, while the districts of Bonaberi, Deido and New Bell have almost no images. The archives which provide documentation about the city are based in Paris,<ref>French national archives, Section Outre-mer and D\u00e9partment des Estampes; Documentation Fran\u00e7ais, Phototh\u00e8que Afrique; Archives des P\u00e8res du Saint-Esprit; Archives des Missions des \u00c9glises \u00c9vangeliques; Agence France Press.</ref> Basel,<ref>Archives of Mission 21.</ref> Hamburg,<ref>Welwirtschafsvelten; Deutsch Afrika Linien.</ref> Potsdam,<ref>Staatliche Archivverwaltung.</ref> Douala<ref>Archive Photo Prunet.</ref> and Yaound\u00e9.<ref>Goethe Institut.</ref>\n\nIn 1896 a first urban plan of the city was developed during the German colonial period. The plan included a [[Former general Hospital of Douala|hospital]], the [[Old German government headquarters in Douala|governor residency]], the palace of justice, the [[Former police station of Douala|police station]], administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the [[Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House in Douala|Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House]]). The [[Bonakouamouang Chimney]] also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the [[Villa Mandessi Bell]] was begun. In 1905 the [[Palace of the Kings Bell|palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell]] (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell).\n\nBetween 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the [[Chamber of Commerce (Douala 1927-1928)|chamber of commerce]], the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|new palace of justice]], the new railway station, the [[vault of the Kings Bell]] and the catholic [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Douala|cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul]] were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the [[Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa]] was constructed. In 1947 the [[Temple of the Centenary in Douala|Temple of the Centenary]] was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Dani\u00e8le Diwouta-Kotto,<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was  launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been  produced in Douala.<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/>\n\nThe publication ''Suites architecturales''<ref name=\"Diwouta-Kotto, Dani\u00e8le 2010 p. 42\"/> focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show-room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, [[Union Bank of Cameroon]], Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA-SCB, [[doual'art|espace doual'art]], and Orange Flagship. The [[Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda]] was built in 1990.\n\nAlong the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style [[patisserie]]s; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and nearby [[mangrove]] swamps.  Many of these are frequented by the city's large [[expatriate]] population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the [[petroleum industry]].\n\n== Culture ==\n* [[Douala Maritime Museum]], Museum showcasing the rich maritime history of Douala. The building is shaped like a boat (however the museum only occupy 400 m2 of the building). It is located in the administrative area [[Bonanjo]]\n* [[Doual'art]], an art gallery/center\n* [[La Nouvelle Libert\u00e9]], a 12m piece from [[Joseph Francis Sum\u00e9gn\u00e9]] inaugurated in 2007. A permanent monumental sculpture made with recycled material located at a main roundabout in Douala. It is 12 meters high with a wingspan of 5 meters.\n\n== Places of worship ==   \nAmong the [[places of worship]], they are predominantly [[Christianity|Christian]] churches and temples : [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Douala]] ([[Catholic Church]]), [[Evangelical Church of Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Presbyterian Church in Cameroon]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), [[Union of Baptist Churches in Cameroon]] ([[Baptist World Alliance]]), [[Integrity for All]] ([[Christian Missionary Fellowship and Associated Churches]]), Full Gospel Mission Cameroon ([[Assemblies of God]]).<ref> J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, \u2018\u2018Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices\u2019\u2019, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 484-486</ref> There are also [[Islam|Muslim]] mosques.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main article|Education in Cameroon}}\nAs in most large cities in Cameroon there are several [[Nursery school|nursery]], [[Primary school|primary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[high school]]s in the city. In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba.\n\nThe city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the [[University of Douala]].<ref>Presidential act n\u00b0 93/030 of 19 January 1993.</ref>There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an [[aviation school]] called [[CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Gare de Bessengu\u00e9 2.JPG|thumb|Gare de Bessengu\u00e9, Douala's train station]]\nDouala is linked by [[Camrail|rail]] to [[Yaound\u00e9]], [[Ngaound\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Kumba]] and [[Nkongsamba]]. Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nA [[tram]] network is planned for Douala, with the first line projected to open in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/douala-tram-project-poised-to-launch.html|title=Douala tram project poised to launch|date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Douala International Airport]] is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Istanbul]]. Regional and continental destinations include [[Abidjan]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Lagos]], [[Malabo]], and [[Nairobi]]. The airport is the busiest in the [[CEMAC]] area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure.\n\nThe [[seaport]] has {{convert|8.5|m|abbr=off}} of [[Draft (ship)|draft]].\n\n== Economy ==\nDouala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nMain economic parameters are:\n\n*'''GDP:''' $42.2 billion (2006 est.):\n* '''GDP growth rate''': 4.1% (2006 est.)\n* '''Exports-partners''': Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005)\n*'''Imports - partners''': France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005)\n\n=== Wealth and poverty ===\nEven though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cameroon.html|title=Cameroon|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== People ==\n* [[Louis Brody]] (1892\u20131951), German actor\n* [[Jacques Kuoh-Moukouri]] (1909-2002), Cameroonian author and diplomat\n* Prince [[Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell]] (1927\u20132012), chief of Douala<ref>{{cite web|title=Cameroun : qui \u00e9tait Son Altesse Royale le Prince Ren\u00e9 Douala Manga Bell ?|url=http://www.afrik.com/cameroun-qui-etait-son-altesse-royale-le-prince-rene-douala-manga-bell|website=afrik.com|language=fr|date=4 January 2013}}.</ref> \n* [[Francis Bebey]] (1929\u20132002), author \n* [[Manu Dibango]] (1933\u20132020), musician, saxophonist and singer, world jazz, ethno-jazz.\n* [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Kuoh-Moukouri]] (1938-), feminist and author \n* [[Jean-Pierre Dikongu\u00e9 Pipa]] (1940\u2013), cineast\n* [[Patrick Baudry]] (1946\u2013), second French [[astronaut]] and first astronaut of an African country\n* [[Nton\u00e8 Nton\u00e8 Fritz]] (1954\u2013), politician\n* [[\u00c9lise Mballa]] (1961\u2013), dancer\n* [[Maka Kotto]] (1961\u2013), Canadian politician\n* [[Ang\u00e8le Etoundi Essamba]] (1962\u2013), photograph\n* [[Petit Pays]] (1967\u2013), singer, dancer, author\n* [[Blaise Bang]] (1968\u2013), artist\n* [[Hemley Boum]] (1973\u2013), writer\n* [[Achillek\u00e0 Komguem]] (1973\u2013), artist\n* [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pierre Wom\u00e9]] (1979\u2013), footballer\n* [[Killamel]] (1984\u2013), rap dancer\n* [[V\u00e9ronique Mang]] (1984\u2013), sport\n* Vital Mevengue (1978\u2014)\n* [[Paul-Georges Ntep]] (1992\u2013), footballer\n* [[Samuel Eto'o]] (1981\u2013), footballer\n* [[Narcisse Mouelle Kombi]](1962\u2013 ), writer and politician\n* [[Christian Ngan]] (1983\u2013 ), entrepreneur, business man and financier\n* [[Marc Kibong Mbamba]] (1988\u2013), footballer\n* [[Pascal Siakam]] (1994\u2013 ), basketball player - 2019 NBA Champion\n* [[Ibrahim Amadou]] (1993\u2013), footballer\n* [[Fidele Ntie-Kang]] (1976-), chemist\n* [[Elsa Kwin]], singer and competitor on [[The Voice Afrique Francophone]]\n* [[Kareyce Fotso]] (2010-), Cameroonian singer\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\nDoula is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Strasbourg]], France\n*{{flagicon|Turkey}} [[Akhisar]], Turkey\n*{{flagicon|Senegal}} [[Dakar]], Senegal\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], United States\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Philadelphia]], United States\n*{{flagicon|Namibia}} [[Windhoek]],  Namibia\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Cameroon]]\n* [[Timeline of Douala]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{See also|Timeline of Douala#Bibliography|l1=Bibliography of the history of Douala}}\n* {{in lang|en}} Brooke, James (1987). \"Informal Capitalism Grows in Cameroon.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Welsch stated it is \"implausible\" and \"difficult to reconcile\" with comments repeatedly made by management and with the litany of trainer incidents and injuries that have occurred over the years. Welsch did, however, agree that the fine classification was too severe and had it downgraded \u2013 from \"willful\" (total of $75,000 for the 2 citations) to \"serious\" (total of $12,000) \u2013 stating that the company had emphasized trainer safety, even if the safety procedures weren't effective.<ref name=OSHRC/><ref name=Kirby-TP/>\n\nThe court was scathing in its assessment of SeaWorld's expert, Mr. Andrews', opinion, \"that Tilikum grabbed Ms. Brancheau by the hair out of curiosity because he was unfamiliar with it\" as \"speculative\" and having \"no basis in fact\". Accordingly, \"The court accords it no weight.\" The court criticized SeaWorld's \"closed system\" of logic, which blamed trainers for their injuries, by a flawed circularity of reasoning whereby, \"SeaWorld believes it 'condition[s] all aspects of behavior.' All behavior is thus predictable. If an undesirable behavior occurs, it is because the trainer missed a known precursor. Ergo, the trainer is always at fault for the killer whale's undesirable behavior. In this closed system, any injuries sustained by a trainer will always be traceable to human error. It is not the operant conditioning program that is inadequate; it is the performance of the trainer that is flawed.\"\n\nThe court made clear that while SeaWorld's expert, \"Mr Andrews concludes his report by stating, 'My expert opinion is that SeaWorld can safely allow trainers to closely interact with killer whales, including waterwork, with the administrative and engineering controls that existed prior to February 24, 2010' (Exh. C-15, p.&nbsp;10),\" the court found otherwise: \"As noted in the section addressing the recognized hazard, SeaWorld's own incident reports demonstrate that its safety program, either due to misplaced faith in operant conditioning or due to human error in implementing operant conditioning, exposes its trainers to the risks of death or serious physical injury.\" The court amplified this, aligning itself with the OSHA expert witness: \"Dr. Duffus stated, '[T]he training program that SeaWorld uses is influential. It does work. My point is that it does not work all the time' (Tr. 911). The court agrees with Dr. Duffus. SeaWorld's training program is highly detailed, well-communicated, and intensive. Yet it cannot remove the element of unpredictability inherent in working with killer whales.\"<ref name=OSHRC/>\n\nWelsch made it clear that his ruling only applies \"to the work trainers do during shows and not at other times, such as during medical procedures or 'relationship-building' sessions... As a custodian SeaWorld has an ethical duty to provide for the whales' needs... husbandry activities require a certain amount of contact between the trainers and whales... unlike performances, which can successfully continue without the trainers in the water.\" OSHA did state that it would accept other means of protection as long as it provided equal or greater safety as the physical barriers.

Each time, the temporary pause was then lifted by SeaWorld. However, on this occasion, the ban was solidified by an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) intervention.

Welsch stated it is \"implausible\" and \"difficult to reconcile\" with comments repeatedly made by management and with the litany of trainer incidents and injuries that have occurred over the years. Welsch did, however, agree that the fine classification was too severe and had it downgraded \u2013 from \"willful\" (total of $75,000 for the 2 citations) to \"serious\" (total of $12,000) \u2013 stating that the company had emphasized trainer safety, even if the safety procedures weren't effective.<ref name=OSHRC/><ref name=Kirby-TP/>\n\nThe court was scathing in its assessment of SeaWorld's expert, Mr. Andrews', opinion, \"that Tilikum grabbed Ms. Brancheau by the hair out of curiosity because he was unfamiliar with it\" as \"speculative\" and having \"no basis in fact\". Accordingly, \"The court accords it no weight.\" The court criticized SeaWorld's \"closed system\" of logic, which blamed trainers for their injuries, by a flawed circularity of reasoning whereby, \"SeaWorld believes it 'condition[s] all aspects of behavior.' All behavior is thus predictable. If an undesirable behavior occurs, it is because the trainer missed a known precursor. Ergo, the trainer is always at fault for the killer whale's undesirable behavior. In this closed system, any injuries sustained by a trainer will always be traceable to human error. It is not the operant conditioning program that is inadequate; it is the performance of the trainer that is flawed.\"\n\nThe court made clear that while SeaWorld's expert, \"Mr Andrews concludes his report by stating, 'My expert opinion is that SeaWorld can safely allow trainers to closely interact with killer whales, including waterwork, with the administrative and engineering controls that existed prior to February 24, 2010' (Exh. C-15, p.&nbsp;10),\" the court found otherwise: \"As noted in the section addressing the recognized hazard, SeaWorld's own incident reports demonstrate that its safety program, either due to misplaced faith in operant conditioning or due to human error in implementing operant conditioning, exposes its trainers to the risks of death or serious physical injury.\" The court amplified this, aligning itself with the OSHA expert witness: \"Dr. Duffus stated, '[T]he training program that SeaWorld uses is influential. It does work. My point is that it does not work all the time' (Tr. 911). The court agrees with Dr. Duffus. SeaWorld's training program is highly detailed, well-communicated, and intensive. Yet it cannot remove the element of unpredictability inherent in working with killer whales.\"<ref name=OSHRC/>\n\nWelsch made it clear that his ruling only applies \"to the work trainers do during shows and not at other times, such as during medical procedures or 'relationship-building' sessions... As a custodian SeaWorld has an ethical duty to provide for the whales' needs... husbandry activities require a certain amount of contact between the trainers and whales... unlike performances, which can successfully continue without the trainers in the water.\" OSHA did state that it would accept other means of protection as long as it provided equal or greater safety as the physical barriers. SeaWorld looked at rising pool floors and \"spare air\" systems in an attempt to get their staff back in the water during shows.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-05-30/business/os-seaworld-osha-ruling-20120530_1_seaworld-killer-whale-trainers-killer-whales-marine-park-operator|title=SeaWorld OSHA ruling: Judge rules SeaWorld killer-whale trainers must be protected by physical barriers|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref> Given the court rulings, even after 2010, although water work during shows stopped, SeaWorld trainers still entered the water with orcas during \"safety desensitization training\" and for other care.<ref name=Lee20140820/>\n\nSeaWorld filed a series of appeals, seeking to return to water performances.<ref name=ABC/><ref name=Karlamangla/> In 2012, a special Labor Department commission declined to hear the case.<ref name=Kirby-TP/> Since the ''[[Shamu (SeaWorld show)|Shamu]]'' show's interaction of animal trainers with orcas was seen as having been SeaWorld's star attraction,<ref name=ABC/> SeaWorld contended that it was fundamental to its business.<ref name=ABC/><ref name=USCA121375/> In April 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] denied a \"petition for review\",<ref name=USCA121375/><ref name=Kuo20140411/><ref name=Lee20140820/> with Brett Kavanaugh being the sole judge to side with SeaWorld.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Biskupic |first1=Joan |title=What the case of a killer whale tells us about Brett Kavanaugh |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/25/politics/brett-kavanaugh-killer-whale-chevron-regulations/index.html |work=CNN |date=August 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Stone |first1=Ken |title=SCOTUS Nominee Kavanaugh Backed SeaWorld in Case Involving 2010 Trainer Death |url=https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2018/07/10/scotus-nominee-kavanaugh-backed-seaworld-in-case-involving-trainer-death/ |work=Times of San Diego |date=July 10, 2018}}</ref> In 2015, SeaWorld was cited again, in [[San Diego]], for not adequately protecting orca trainers.<ref name=AP20160317/>\n\nAlthough Brancheau's widower, Scott Brancheau, hired a [[Chicago]] law firm that specializes in [[wrongful-death]] litigation, he has not taken any legal action against SeaWorld.<ref name=Garcia-SWTF/>\n\n===''Blackfish''===\n{{Main|Blackfish (film)}}\nBrancheau's death is a focus of the documentary ''[[Blackfish (film)|Blackfish]]'',<ref name=cnn20160319>{{cite web|url=http://wtvr.com/2016/03/18/after-seaworld-a-blackfish-effect-on-circuses-and-zoos/ |title=After SeaWorld, a 'Blackfish effect' on circuses and zoos?|website=WTVR|via=CNN Wire|date=March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=bloomberg20160317>{{cite web | last=Kay | first=Jennifer | last2=Schneider | first2=Mike | title=SeaWorld to Stop Breeding Orcas, Making Them Perform Tricks | website=Bloomberg.com | date=March 17, 2016 | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-17/urgent-seaworld-says-it-will-end-killer-whale-breeding-program | accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref> which criticizes keeping orcas in captivity,<ref name=IWI/> and her death awakened a national conversation about the issue.<ref name=Kirby-DaSW>{{cite book|title=Death at SeaWorld: Shamu and the Dark Side of Killer Whales in Captivity|first=David|last=Kirby|authorlink=David Kirby (journalist)|publisher=Macmillan|date=July 17, 2012|quote=What's more, the killing of Ms. Brancheau woke up a previously inattentive media to a gripping story and a bruising nation debate \u2014 one that would soon drag in the courts, Congress, and even the Obama administration into a roiling conflict}}</ref> The director, Gabriela Cowperthwaite, argued that the claim that the orca had targeted Brancheau because she had worn her hair in a long [[ponytail]] was [[conjecture]] and that \"there had to be more to this story\".<ref name=IWI/>\n\nHer family has said they are grateful that the film has brought attention to the issue of animal welfare.

According to the [[Legend|legendary]] [[Sanskrit]] epics of India, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], there was once a dense forest area named [[Dandakaranya]], in the region where Kanker is located. According to myth, Kanker was also a land of monks and sages. Many [[Rishi|Rishis]] (monks/sages) such as Kank, Lomesh, Shringi, Angira were said to have lived here. The influence of Buddhism on the region started in the sixth century BC.

After Satvahana rule, the state was under the control of the Nags, [[Vakataka dynasty|Vakataks]], Gupt, Nal and Chalukya dynasties. The Som dynasty was founded by the king Singh Raj, and this dynasty ruled the state from 1125 to 1344. After the downfall of the Som dynasty, Dharam Dev founded the Kandra dynasty which ruled the state up to 1385. After the downfall of the  Kandra dynasty, the Chandra dynasty came. According to a myth, the first king of this dynasty was Veer Kanhar Dev. He ruled the state up to 1404. This dynasty ruled the state up to 1802. In more recent years, this district has been affected by violence from [[Naxalite]] groups ([[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Indian Maoists]]).\n\n==Kanker Princely State==\nThe Kanker state came under the control of the Bhosales of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] during the reign of Bhoop Dev from 1809 to 1818. During the kingship of Narhari Deb, the Kanker state came under [[British Empire|control of the British]] from Maratha. Because the British government gave the adoption to Narhari Dev, he acknowledged fealty to the British. In 1882, the control of Kanker State was handed over to Commissioner Raipur.\n\nThe rule of Narhar Deo saw the construction of many buildings, including a palace near Gadiya Mountain, a printing press, a library, Radhakrishna Temple, Ramjanki Temple, Jagannath Temple and Balaji Temple. Narhar Deo made a plan termed 'Ratna Bhandar' for keeping grain in stock for his people. He established a new town named Narharpur near Kanker.\n\nIn 1904, Komal Dev became the king of Kanker. During his rule one English secondary school, one Girls school, and 15 primary Schools were established, as well as two hospitals: one in Kanker and the other in [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]]. He established a new town near Kanker named. He also tried to  the capital, instead of Kanker. He died on 8 January 1925. After his death, Bhanupratap Dev became the king. Bhanupratap Dev was the last king of Kanker before the [[Indian independence movement|Independence of India]]. After independence, he was elected twice as a member of the legislative assembly from Kanker constituency.\nChampalal Chopda landlord (zamindar) of Mulla ,Bhanupratappur ,Chougel & ottekasa was warmly generous man he was responsible ,respectful and loyal towards common people's and villagers.he worked very hard during his time temples were constructed. he followed his principals throughout his life .he also believed in simplicity and equality.

In 1999, Kanker received its identity as an independent district. It is now surrounded by five other districts of Chhattisgarh state:  [[Kondagaon District]], [[Dhamtari District]],  [[Balod district|Balod District]], [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] and [[Rajnandgaon District]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kanker.gov.in/\n|title=Kander District Website\n|publisher=\n|accessdate = 2006-09-22\n}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently a part of the [[Red Corridor]], the region in the eastern, central and the southern parts of India that experience considerable [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency|Naxalite\u2013Maoist]] insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/12/naxal-menace-83-districts-under.html |title=83 districts under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme |publisher=IntelliBriefs |date= 2009-12-11 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==General Information==\n===Demographics===\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Kanker district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 748,941,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Guyana]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nGuyana 744,768\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

May is the hottest month and December is the coolest month. Annual average rainfall in the district is 1492&nbsp;mm, 90% of which falls during the period from June to October. The average annual rainfall has fluctuated greatly over the last six years.\n\nWithin the district, the Kanker and Charama blocks have a predominantly dry climate, whereas that of Bhanupratappur is of the wet type.\n\n===Geography=== \nThe district headquarters of [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]] is 140 kilometers from [[Raipur]] and 160 kilometers from [[Jagadalpur]]. Though well connected by roads, the district still does not fall within the vast network of the Indian rail service.\n\nThe [[Mahanadi River]], Doodh River, Hatkul River, [[Sondur River]] and Turu River all flow through small pockets of hills in the district.\n\n===Topography===\nThe physical area of Kanker is heterogeneous and is a mix between flat land and undulating hills. Most of the land is between 300 and 600 meters above sea level, and about 80% of the area of Kanker is flat. These flat lands can be divided into two parts, the Mahanadi Plane and the Kotri Plane.\n\nThe northeastern part of Kanker is on the Mahanadi Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 500 meters above sea level. The main river in that area is the Mahanadi River. Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh, Sondur, Nakti, and Toori are the other rivers of the area. Bhanupratappur is located on the Kotri Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 400 meters above sea level. Korti and Valler are the main rivers of this area. The topography of Kanker district is also dotted with a multitude of hilly regions. These can be divided into the following three groups:\n\n'''A. Vindhyana Hill Group:''' These hill groups are spread in the south eastern part of Kanker district, where the soil constitutes six phases of quartile and sand.\n\n'''B. Archian Hill Groups:''' 95% of the area of Kanker is covered by Archian Hill Group. In this area, [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rocks are spread over almost all the geographical area of the district.\n\n'''C. Dharwar Hill Group:''' This hill group is very crude and broken in shape and form. These hills are spread all over the northern region of the district, in the areas close to Sambalpur and Bhanupratappur.\n\n===Soil===\nThe soil in Kanker originates from granite, gneiss, sand and khedar. Most of the area is covered with red soil. The soil is faintly coloured in the higher regions of the hilly tract, while in the river valleys, the soil is smooth and fertile. The soils of this district can be divided into four types.\n\n'''A. Kanhar:''' This type of soil is black and oily. The capacity of water absorption by this soil is great, and this is very useful in growth of [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] and [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] crops in the region. This type of soil is found in the planes of Kotri and Mahanadi.\n\n'''B. Dorsa:''' This type of soil is medium in nature and it is very similar to Matasi and Kanhar type soil. This type of soil is found in north east Kanker and in the Bhanupratappur region.\n\n'''C. Matasi:''' This type of soil is found at an elevation higher than Kanhar and less than Bhata. This soil is appropriate for growing rice. This type of soil is found in most of the Kanker region.\n\n'''D. Bhata:''' This soil-type is affected by a late rating process. It can be red or yellow, having a mixed shape/condition. This soil is found in uplands of the area. It is appropriate for the cultivation of crops like [[Millet|Kodo]], [[Macrotyloma uniflorum|Kulthi]], [[Maize]] and Kutki.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThere are 7 blocks/tehsils in Kanker district. They are:\n* [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]]\n* Charama\n* Narharpur\n* Bhanupratappur\n* Durgukondal\n* Antagarh\n* [[Pakhanjore]]/Koylibeda.\n\nThere are 389 Gram Panchayats and 995 villages in the Kanker district.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the mainstay of people in the district. Even though large numbers of them are tribal, it is agriculture that sustains them for most of the year. Non-timber forest produce is another major source of income, as large tracts of the land are still forested. The tribes in many places practice Marham or Dippa. The farmers who live in the forest cut the trees before the rainy season and use the land for agriculture. After every two years they prepare a new farm and leave the old one [[Crop rotation|fallow]] for some time. On the planes, the land is farm every year. Rice is the main crop but wheat, sugar cane, Gram, Kodo, Moong, Tilli, and maize other important crops. People also grow varieties of vegetables. Varieties of fruits such as mangoes, and bananas are also produced.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|title=Resources and Economy|publisher=|accessdate=2006-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115100929/http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|archive-date=2006-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAbout half of rural Kanker is below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], according to official estimates.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\" /> The entire district is [[drought]] prone. Over 80 percent of the working population is already dependent on marginal agriculture and allied activities, with low incomes and stagnant productivity. Thus, in addition to providing a livelihood for the unemployed, it is a challenge to make the existing the livelihoods of the nearly 295,000 (2.95 lakh) workers more productive. This would be beneficial, since persons engaged in agriculture could then earn an adequate income to meet their [[Poverty in India|basic needs]]. Thus, the only feasible option in the short to medium run is to increase employment in the main livelihood sector, which is agriculture. Diversification, intensification and stabilisation of agriculture are at the core of the challenge of livelihood promotion in the district.\n\n==Minerals==\nKanker is rich in minerals. [[Iron ore]], [[quartzite]] and [[garnet]] deposits are found in southern regions of the district, but mining of these minerals on a commercial scale has not been attempted. About 100 million tons of iron ore deposits have been identified in the Hahaladdi region of the Bhanupratappur Tehsil. Chhattisgarh's second biggest iron ore deposits, [[Rowghat Mines]], is in Antargarh tehsil in this district. Its reserves are assessed at 1.343 billion tons. Rowghat Mines will supply iron ore to the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL.\n\nBlack and white granite is plentiful in the district, where it is used as a building material. In the Markatola and in Barchhegondi region aluminium-bearing [[Sillimanite]]/Kinite deposits have been identified. Some deposits of gold have been found in Sona Dehi, Michgaon and in certain other regions of Bhanupratappur Tehsil. At present some [[bauxite]]-based (aluminium) industries are functional in the district.\n\n==Flora==\nMost of the forest in Kanker district is of [[Dry deciduous forest|dry deciduous]] type. In Kanker district Sal, teak and mixed forests are found. Sal forests are found in the eastern part of the district, teak forests are found in the Bhanupratappur region and mixed forests are found in most of the area. In the mixed forest varieties of medicinal plants and other economically important plants such as Saja, Rendu, Dhaura, Bija, Harra and Mahua are found in abundance.\n\n==Socio-cultural Aspects==\nAbout half of the total population is Kanker district is tribal. Accordingly, most of the culture of Kanker district is tribal, even though an interplay/fusion with other cultures is clearly visible.\n\n===Languages===\nAt the time of the [[2011 Census of India]], 66.77% of the population in the district spoke [[Hindi]], 17.06.% [[Gondi language|Gondi]], 13.10% [[Bengali language|Bengali]], 1.71% [[Halbi language|Halbi]] and 0.40% [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] as their first language.<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16.html 2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue]</ref>\n\nThe chief languages or dialects used in the Kanker district are Hindi, [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]], [[Gondi language|Gondi]] and [[Halbi language|Halbi]]. There were times when Halbi was an important language; at one time all of the administrative work was done in that language. Halbi is a compound form of Hindi.\n\n[[Bhatri language|Bhatri]] is the main branch of Halbi language. There are a lot of words taken in this language from other languages including Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, and Farsi. Like Hindi, Halbi also has two genders, masculine and feminine, but the feminine is used more.\n\nThe other languages such as Bengali, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] are also spoken in some parts of the district.\n\n===Religion===\nUntil the end of the Nal dynasty, the people were divided into four different [[Caste system in India|castes]], namely: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. After the downfall of the Nal dynasty, many people came from outside and the main castes divided into sub-castes. There were around 62 castes in Bastar state and Kanker state.\n\nThe tribes Maria, Gond, Ojha, Muria, Bhatra are divided into sub-caste San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra, Amnit Bhatra Amnit. These castes hold highest status. Parja, Gadva, Halba, Ganda, Mahra, Chandal, Ghuruva, Dom, Lohar, Matrigond, Rajgond, [[Dorla people|Dorla]], Nahar, Naikpod, Kuduk, Andkuri, Kumhar, Kosta, Chamar, Kenvat, Dhakad, were important and in other castes Brahmin, Vaishya, Kayasth, Teli, Kalar, Kshtriya, Kunbi, Dhobi, Marathi, Mohammedan, Pathan, Telanga, Orria, Rohilla and others were important. About half of the population is tribal, although in this modern era the culture has slightly changed.\n\n===Family structure===\nIn all castes, people live as a joint family. All the families are male dominant. The oldest person is the head of the family and all other members obey his authority. The oldest person of the family has full authority on all financial matters. All sons have the same share in the family assets, however daughters have no share. In tribes, the women play an important role.\n\n===Marriage===\nLike all other cultured castes, the marriage ceremony is very important to the tribes of Kanker.\n\n* Among Halbas, two types of marriages are popular, namely brief marriages and detailed marriages.\n* Among Bhatras, four types of marriages are popular namely arranged marriage, love marriages, widow marriages and dhariya marriage.\n* Among Murias, arrange marriage, love marriage and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n* Among all types of Gonds, arranged marriages, love marriages and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n\nAmong the tribes, if any woman chooses a new husband, then the new husband gives money to the old husband as 'compensation allowance'. This compensation is settled by the leader of caste. Re-marriage of widows is also popular among tribes. In Halbas no widow may be married with any unmarried person. In some tribes, there is a tradition named Ghotul. Ghotul is a cultural centre of Gonds and Murias.\n\n===Customs at death===\nThe tribal customs of death are complex.\n\nThe Maria bury dead bodies. If a woman dies during her pregnancy, her body is buried. If a child who is younger than 5 years dies, then their body is also buried beneath a Mahua tree and their head is placed facing an easterly direction. They construct a little tomb in that place in memory of the dead person.\n\nThe Gonds place the legs facing the south, in tombs. In some tribes they place a wooden pole in memory of the dead person.\n\n===Madai and other Festivals===\nAmong the tribes of Kanker and [[Bastar district|Bastar]] districts there is an important festival celebrated called [[Madai Festival|Madai]]. This festival is a moving festival and moves throughout the Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada regions from December to March. The celebration of the festival starts in Bastar Region in December. On Poornima people celebrate the Madai festival in respect of the goddess Kesharpal Kesharpalin Devi.\n\nIn January, the people of Kanker, and the adjoining areas of Charama and Kurna, celebrate the Madai festival. In the month of February, the festival is celebrated in Bastar district and there the festival is celebrated in the respect of Cheri-Chher-Kin. At the end of February, the Madai festival goes to Antagarh, Narayanpur and Bhanupratappur, and in March it is celebrated in Kondagaon, Keshkal and Bhopalpattanam. \n\nThe festival is celebrated in the respect of local Gods and Goddess. This festival is celebrated in a big ground where thousands of peoples gather simultaneously. The festival starts with a procession of local God or Goddess; after that the worship is done and then the festival starts. A lot of shops, restaurants, crafts, dances and other cultural program can be seen in this festival.\n\nAlthough the festival is tribal, all the communities have faith, celebrate and enjoy the festival. Other important festivals are Mati-tihar, Gobar-boharani, [[Rama Navami]] and Navakhani.\n\nThe standard Hindu festivals of Dusshera, Diwali, and Holi are celebrated also, as in other parts of [[India]].\n\n===Handicrafts===\nThe tribal societies of Kanker are known for their handicrafts prepared with a variety of designs and shapes. These handicrafts include wood-carvings, bell-metal items, terracotta items, and bamboo items, among others. Kanker is a forestry district containing good quality woods from which wooden-carving crafts and various types of furniture are made by skilled artisans. These items attract locals as well as outsiders.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Wood and bamboo crafts===\nThis is one of the most distinctive arts of tribal wooden carving.{{fact|date=March 2019}} These wooden crafts are made out of the finest teak wood and white wood. These wooden crafts include models, idols, wall panels and furniture items. These handicrafts are generally exported to different parts of India, and there is also demand from foreign countries.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The tribes make bamboo crafts also.

The palace was owned by the esteemed 12th century royal family. The family of the late Maharajadhiraj Udai Pratap Deo resided here, since 2002. Now some section of the palace are being converted into a hotel.\n\n===The Gadiya Mountain===\nThe Gadiya Mountain came into light at the time of Kandra dynasty. When the Kandra king Dharma Dev won the Kanker, he declared his capital on Gadhiya Mountain, which is a natural form of a fort. On the mountain there is a natural reservoir which never dries and which is filled by water throughout the year. One part of this reservoirs is called 'Sonai' and the other part is called 'Rupai'. Sonai and Rupai were the two daughters of the Kandra king Dharma Dev. On the southern part of this reservoir there is a cave named 'Churi pagar'. The entrance to this cave is very narrow. During any attack the King and his family lived safely in this cave.\n\nThe space of the cave is sufficient to accommodate 500 people inside. The exit door of this cave is towards west direction. In the south east part of Gadiya mountain there is another cave called Jogi cave. The length of this cave is 50 meters. In ancient times, it is said that many monks lived and meditated here. There is a small pond in this cave. The water of this cave flows on the rock like a waterfall. The Doodh river flows at the bottom of Gadiya mountain, .\n\n'''Legend'''\nYears ago, it is said, a King lived in the Gadhiya Mountain. He had two daughters named \"Sonai\" and \"Rupai\". Both were playing near the lake over the hilly area. Suddenly they both fell in the lake; that lake was later named \"Sonai Rupai Talab\". It is said that the water of that lake never dries and there are two fish on very bottom of that Lake. One fish is of gold and another one is of silver. According to the legend, both fish are remain alive even to this day. Many people in Kanker claim that they have seen both fish. On the mountain there are two rocks behind the main \"Sheetla Temple\" and the door between those mountain is very thin. Only slim persons can enter there, but after entering the middle there is a Big Hall in which about 300 people can be seated. People say that the King used to stay with his soldiers during any war on that particular place.\n\nOn the occasion of Navratri, a cultural fest known as Gadhiya Mahotsav is celebrated beneath the Gadhiya Mountain.\n\n===Malanjhkudum Waterfall===\nAbout 15 kilometres away towards south form Kanker, there is a small mountain. On this mountain there is a spot named Neele Gondi from where the Doodh river takes its shape. After crossing the 10 kilometres there is a place named as Malanjhkudum from where the river produces three waterfalls. The heights of these waterfalls are 10 meters. 15 meters and 9 meters respectively. The slope of this water fall is like a ladder. The wave of this waterfall is very attractive and challenging. This is an ideal place for picnic. The road is available to reach this spot.\n\n===Charre-Marre Waterfall===\nThis is another waterfall situated in Kanker district. This waterfall is situated 17 kilometers away from Antagarh block of Kanker district. There is a place named Charre-Marre on the way from Antagarh to Aamabera.

The total area of the district is 5285.01 square kilometres.  The population is 748,941.\n\nThe district's headquarters, [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh| Kanker]] town, is situated on the [[National Highway 30 (India)|National Highway NH-43]]. Kanker town lies between Chhattisgarh's two largest cities: [[Chhattisgarh]]'s capital, [[Raipur]], and [[Jagdalpur]], the district headquarters of the neighbouring [[Bastar district]].The secretary in charge for the district is Mr.Dhananjay Dewangan(IAS)\n\n==History==\nThe history of Kanker begins in the [[Stone Age]]. According to the [[Legend|legendary]] [[Sanskrit]] epics of India, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], there was once a dense forest area named [[Dandakaranya]], in the region where Kanker is located. According to myth, Kanker was also a land of monks and sages. Many [[Rishi|Rishis]] (monks/sages) such as Kank, Lomesh, Shringi, Angira were said to have lived here. The influence of Buddhism on the region started in the sixth century BC. The ancient history of Kanker records that it always remained an independent state.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\">http://planningonline.gov.in/data/report/DP2010-2011_381Merge.pdf{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 106 AD, the Kanker state was under the rule of the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satvahana dynasty]] and the king was [[Satakarni|Satkarni]], This fact is also described by Chinese visitor Whensaung. After Satvahana rule, the state was under the control of the Nags, [[Vakataka dynasty|Vakataks]], Gupt, Nal and Chalukya dynasties. The Som dynasty was founded by the king Singh Raj, and this dynasty ruled the state from 1125 to 1344. After the downfall of the Som dynasty, Dharam Dev founded the Kandra dynasty which ruled the state up to 1385. After the downfall of the  Kandra dynasty, the Chandra dynasty came. According to a myth, the first king of this dynasty was Veer Kanhar Dev. He ruled the state up to 1404. This dynasty ruled the state up to 1802. In more recent years, this district has been affected by violence from [[Naxalite]] groups ([[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Indian Maoists]]).\n\n==Kanker Princely State==\nThe Kanker state came under the control of the Bhosales of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] during the reign of Bhoop Dev from 1809 to 1818. During the kingship of Narhari Deb, the Kanker state came under [[British Empire|control of the British]] from Maratha. Because the British government gave the adoption to Narhari Dev, he acknowledged fealty to the British. In 1882, the control of Kanker State was handed over to Commissioner Raipur.\n\nThe rule of Narhar Deo saw the construction of many buildings, including a palace near Gadiya Mountain, a printing press, a library, Radhakrishna Temple, Ramjanki Temple, Jagannath Temple and Balaji Temple. Narhar Deo made a plan termed 'Ratna Bhandar' for keeping grain in stock for his people. He established a new town named Narharpur near Kanker.\n\nIn 1904, Komal Dev became the king of Kanker. During his rule one English secondary school, one Girls school, and 15 primary Schools were established, as well as two hospitals: one in Kanker and the other in [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]]. He established a new town near Kanker named. He also tried to  the capital, instead of Kanker. He died on 8 January 1925. After his death, Bhanupratap Dev became the king. Bhanupratap Dev was the last king of Kanker before the [[Indian independence movement|Independence of India]]. After independence, he was elected twice as a member of the legislative assembly from Kanker constituency.\nChampalal Chopda landlord (zamindar) of Mulla ,Bhanupratappur ,Chougel & ottekasa was warmly generous man he was responsible ,respectful and loyal towards common people's and villagers.he worked very hard during his time temples were constructed. he followed his principals throughout his life .he also believed in simplicity and equality.

In 1999, Kanker received its identity as an independent district. It is now surrounded by five other districts of Chhattisgarh state:  [[Kondagaon District]], [[Dhamtari District]],  [[Balod district|Balod District]], [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] and [[Rajnandgaon District]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kanker.gov.in/\n|title=Kander District Website\n|publisher=\n|accessdate = 2006-09-22\n}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently a part of the [[Red Corridor]], the region in the eastern, central and the southern parts of India that experience considerable [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency|Naxalite\u2013Maoist]] insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/12/naxal-menace-83-districts-under.html |title=83 districts under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme |publisher=IntelliBriefs |date= 2009-12-11 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==General Information==\n===Demographics===\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Kanker district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 748,941,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Guyana]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nGuyana 744,768\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

May is the hottest month and December is the coolest month. Annual average rainfall in the district is 1492&nbsp;mm, 90% of which falls during the period from June to October. The average annual rainfall has fluctuated greatly over the last six years.\n\nWithin the district, the Kanker and Charama blocks have a predominantly dry climate, whereas that of Bhanupratappur is of the wet type.\n\n===Geography=== \nThe district headquarters of [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]] is 140 kilometers from [[Raipur]] and 160 kilometers from [[Jagadalpur]]. Though well connected by roads, the district still does not fall within the vast network of the Indian rail service.\n\nThe [[Mahanadi River]], Doodh River, Hatkul River, [[Sondur River]] and Turu River all flow through small pockets of hills in the district.\n\n===Topography===\nThe physical area of Kanker is heterogeneous and is a mix between flat land and undulating hills. Most of the land is between 300 and 600 meters above sea level, and about 80% of the area of Kanker is flat. These flat lands can be divided into two parts, the Mahanadi Plane and the Kotri Plane.\n\nThe northeastern part of Kanker is on the Mahanadi Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 500 meters above sea level. The main river in that area is the Mahanadi River. Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh, Sondur, Nakti, and Toori are the other rivers of the area. Bhanupratappur is located on the Kotri Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 400 meters above sea level. Korti and Valler are the main rivers of this area. The topography of Kanker district is also dotted with a multitude of hilly regions. These can be divided into the following three groups:\n\n'''A. Vindhyana Hill Group:''' These hill groups are spread in the south eastern part of Kanker district, where the soil constitutes six phases of quartile and sand.\n\n'''B. Archian Hill Groups:''' 95% of the area of Kanker is covered by Archian Hill Group. In this area, [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rocks are spread over almost all the geographical area of the district.\n\n'''C. Dharwar Hill Group:''' This hill group is very crude and broken in shape and form. These hills are spread all over the northern region of the district, in the areas close to Sambalpur and Bhanupratappur.\n\n===Soil===\nThe soil in Kanker originates from granite, gneiss, sand and khedar. Most of the area is covered with red soil. The soil is faintly coloured in the higher regions of the hilly tract, while in the river valleys, the soil is smooth and fertile. The soils of this district can be divided into four types.\n\n'''A. Kanhar:''' This type of soil is black and oily. The capacity of water absorption by this soil is great, and this is very useful in growth of [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] and [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] crops in the region. This type of soil is found in the planes of Kotri and Mahanadi.\n\n'''B. Dorsa:''' This type of soil is medium in nature and it is very similar to Matasi and Kanhar type soil. This type of soil is found in north east Kanker and in the Bhanupratappur region.\n\n'''C. Matasi:''' This type of soil is found at an elevation higher than Kanhar and less than Bhata. This soil is appropriate for growing rice. This type of soil is found in most of the Kanker region.\n\n'''D. Bhata:''' This soil-type is affected by a late rating process. It can be red or yellow, having a mixed shape/condition. This soil is found in uplands of the area. It is appropriate for the cultivation of crops like [[Millet|Kodo]], [[Macrotyloma uniflorum|Kulthi]], [[Maize]] and Kutki.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThere are 7 blocks/tehsils in Kanker district. They are:\n* [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]]\n* Charama\n* Narharpur\n* Bhanupratappur\n* Durgukondal\n* Antagarh\n* [[Pakhanjore]]/Koylibeda.\n\nThere are 389 Gram Panchayats and 995 villages in the Kanker district.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the mainstay of people in the district. Even though large numbers of them are tribal, it is agriculture that sustains them for most of the year. Non-timber forest produce is another major source of income, as large tracts of the land are still forested. The tribes in many places practice Marham or Dippa. The farmers who live in the forest cut the trees before the rainy season and use the land for agriculture. After every two years they prepare a new farm and leave the old one [[Crop rotation|fallow]] for some time. On the planes, the land is farm every year. Rice is the main crop but wheat, sugar cane, Gram, Kodo, Moong, Tilli, and maize other important crops. People also grow varieties of vegetables. Varieties of fruits such as mangoes, and bananas are also produced.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|title=Resources and Economy|publisher=|accessdate=2006-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115100929/http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|archive-date=2006-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAbout half of rural Kanker is below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], according to official estimates.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\" /> The entire district is [[drought]] prone. Over 80 percent of the working population is already dependent on marginal agriculture and allied activities, with low incomes and stagnant productivity. Thus, in addition to providing a livelihood for the unemployed, it is a challenge to make the existing the livelihoods of the nearly 295,000 (2.95 lakh) workers more productive. This would be beneficial, since persons engaged in agriculture could then earn an adequate income to meet their [[Poverty in India|basic needs]]. Thus, the only feasible option in the short to medium run is to increase employment in the main livelihood sector, which is agriculture. Diversification, intensification and stabilisation of agriculture are at the core of the challenge of livelihood promotion in the district.\n\n==Minerals==\nKanker is rich in minerals. [[Iron ore]], [[quartzite]] and [[garnet]] deposits are found in southern regions of the district, but mining of these minerals on a commercial scale has not been attempted. About 100 million tons of iron ore deposits have been identified in the Hahaladdi region of the Bhanupratappur Tehsil. Chhattisgarh's second biggest iron ore deposits, [[Rowghat Mines]], is in Antargarh tehsil in this district. Its reserves are assessed at 1.343 billion tons. Rowghat Mines will supply iron ore to the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL.\n\nBlack and white granite is plentiful in the district, where it is used as a building material. In the Markatola and in Barchhegondi region aluminium-bearing [[Sillimanite]]/Kinite deposits have been identified. Some deposits of gold have been found in Sona Dehi, Michgaon and in certain other regions of Bhanupratappur Tehsil. At present some [[bauxite]]-based (aluminium) industries are functional in the district.\n\n==Flora==\nMost of the forest in Kanker district is of [[Dry deciduous forest|dry deciduous]] type. In Kanker district Sal, teak and mixed forests are found. Sal forests are found in the eastern part of the district, teak forests are found in the Bhanupratappur region and mixed forests are found in most of the area. In the mixed forest varieties of medicinal plants and other economically important plants such as Saja, Rendu, Dhaura, Bija, Harra and Mahua are found in abundance.\n\n==Socio-cultural Aspects==\nAbout half of the total population is Kanker district is tribal. Accordingly, most of the culture of Kanker district is tribal, even though an interplay/fusion with other cultures is clearly visible.\n\n===Languages===\nAt the time of the [[2011 Census of India]], 66.77% of the population in the district spoke [[Hindi]], 17.06.% [[Gondi language|Gondi]], 13.10% [[Bengali language|Bengali]], 1.71% [[Halbi language|Halbi]] and 0.40% [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] as their first language.<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16.html 2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue]</ref>\n\nThe chief languages or dialects used in the Kanker district are Hindi, [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]], [[Gondi language|Gondi]] and [[Halbi language|Halbi]]. There were times when Halbi was an important language; at one time all of the administrative work was done in that language. Halbi is a compound form of Hindi.\n\n[[Bhatri language|Bhatri]] is the main branch of Halbi language. There are a lot of words taken in this language from other languages including Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, and Farsi. Like Hindi, Halbi also has two genders, masculine and feminine, but the feminine is used more.\n\nThe other languages such as Bengali, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] are also spoken in some parts of the district.\n\n===Religion===\nUntil the end of the Nal dynasty, the people were divided into four different [[Caste system in India|castes]], namely: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. After the downfall of the Nal dynasty, many people came from outside and the main castes divided into sub-castes. There were around 62 castes in Bastar state and Kanker state.\n\nThe tribes Maria, Gond, Ojha, Muria, Bhatra are divided into sub-caste San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra, Amnit Bhatra Amnit. These castes hold highest status. Parja, Gadva, Halba, Ganda, Mahra, Chandal, Ghuruva, Dom, Lohar, Matrigond, Rajgond, [[Dorla people|Dorla]], Nahar, Naikpod, Kuduk, Andkuri, Kumhar, Kosta, Chamar, Kenvat, Dhakad, were important and in other castes Brahmin, Vaishya, Kayasth, Teli, Kalar, Kshtriya, Kunbi, Dhobi, Marathi, Mohammedan, Pathan, Telanga, Orria, Rohilla and others were important. About half of the population is tribal, although in this modern era the culture has slightly changed.\n\n===Family structure===\nIn all castes, people live as a joint family. All the families are male dominant. The oldest person is the head of the family and all other members obey his authority. The oldest person of the family has full authority on all financial matters. All sons have the same share in the family assets, however daughters have no share. In tribes, the women play an important role.\n\n===Marriage===\nLike all other cultured castes, the marriage ceremony is very important to the tribes of Kanker.\n\n* Among Halbas, two types of marriages are popular, namely brief marriages and detailed marriages.\n* Among Bhatras, four types of marriages are popular namely arranged marriage, love marriages, widow marriages and dhariya marriage.\n* Among Murias, arrange marriage, love marriage and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n* Among all types of Gonds, arranged marriages, love marriages and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n\nAmong the tribes, if any woman chooses a new husband, then the new husband gives money to the old husband as 'compensation allowance'. This compensation is settled by the leader of caste. Re-marriage of widows is also popular among tribes. In Halbas no widow may be married with any unmarried person. In some tribes, there is a tradition named Ghotul. Ghotul is a cultural centre of Gonds and Murias.\n\n===Customs at death===\nThe tribal customs of death are complex.\n\nThe Maria bury dead bodies. If a woman dies during her pregnancy, her body is buried. If a child who is younger than 5 years dies, then their body is also buried beneath a Mahua tree and their head is placed facing an easterly direction. They construct a little tomb in that place in memory of the dead person.\n\nThe Gonds place the legs facing the south, in tombs. In some tribes they place a wooden pole in memory of the dead person.\n\n===Madai and other Festivals===\nAmong the tribes of Kanker and [[Bastar district|Bastar]] districts there is an important festival celebrated called [[Madai Festival|Madai]]. This festival is a moving festival and moves throughout the Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada regions from December to March. The celebration of the festival starts in Bastar Region in December. On Poornima people celebrate the Madai festival in respect of the goddess Kesharpal Kesharpalin Devi.\n\nIn January, the people of Kanker, and the adjoining areas of Charama and Kurna, celebrate the Madai festival. In the month of February, the festival is celebrated in Bastar district and there the festival is celebrated in the respect of Cheri-Chher-Kin. At the end of February, the Madai festival goes to Antagarh, Narayanpur and Bhanupratappur, and in March it is celebrated in Kondagaon, Keshkal and Bhopalpattanam. \n\nThe festival is celebrated in the respect of local Gods and Goddess. This festival is celebrated in a big ground where thousands of peoples gather simultaneously. The festival starts with a procession of local God or Goddess; after that the worship is done and then the festival starts. A lot of shops, restaurants, crafts, dances and other cultural program can be seen in this festival.\n\nAlthough the festival is tribal, all the communities have faith, celebrate and enjoy the festival. Other important festivals are Mati-tihar, Gobar-boharani, [[Rama Navami]] and Navakhani.\n\nThe standard Hindu festivals of Dusshera, Diwali, and Holi are celebrated also, as in other parts of [[India]].\n\n===Handicrafts===\nThe tribal societies of Kanker are known for their handicrafts prepared with a variety of designs and shapes. These handicrafts include wood-carvings, bell-metal items, terracotta items, and bamboo items, among others. Kanker is a forestry district containing good quality woods from which wooden-carving crafts and various types of furniture are made by skilled artisans. These items attract locals as well as outsiders.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Wood and bamboo crafts===\nThis is one of the most distinctive arts of tribal wooden carving.{{fact|date=March 2019}} These wooden crafts are made out of the finest teak wood and white wood. These wooden crafts include models, idols, wall panels and furniture items. These handicrafts are generally exported to different parts of India, and there is also demand from foreign countries.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The tribes make bamboo crafts also. Bamboo crafts include wall hangings, table lamps, and table mats among other items.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Noteworthy locations==\nKanker District has the following attractions:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kanker.gov.in/tourism.html\n|title=Tourism\n|publisher=\n|accessdate = 2012-03-31\n}}</ref>\n\n===Kanker Palace<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chhattisgarhtourism.net/index.php/home/kanker.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412052918/http://www.chhattisgarhtourism.net/index.php/home/kanker.html |archive-date=2012-04-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>===\nThis place is very renowned for its royal palace including the tribal villages and the deep forests. The palace was owned by the esteemed 12th century royal family. The family of the late Maharajadhiraj Udai Pratap Deo resided here, since 2002. Now some section of the palace are being converted into a hotel.\n\n===The Gadiya Mountain===\nThe Gadiya Mountain came into light at the time of Kandra dynasty. When the Kandra king Dharma Dev won the Kanker, he declared his capital on Gadhiya Mountain, which is a natural form of a fort. On the mountain there is a natural reservoir which never dries and which is filled by water throughout the year. One part of this reservoirs is called 'Sonai' and the other part is called 'Rupai'. Sonai and Rupai were the two daughters of the Kandra king Dharma Dev. On the southern part of this reservoir there is a cave named 'Churi pagar'. The entrance to this cave is very narrow. During any attack the King and his family lived safely in this cave.\n\nThe space of the cave is sufficient to accommodate 500 people inside. The exit door of this cave is towards west direction. In the south east part of Gadiya mountain there is another cave called Jogi cave. The length of this cave is 50 meters. In ancient times, it is said that many monks lived and meditated here. There is a small pond in this cave. The water of this cave flows on the rock like a waterfall. The Doodh river flows at the bottom of Gadiya mountain, .\n\n'''Legend'''\nYears ago, it is said, a King lived in the Gadhiya Mountain. He had two daughters named \"Sonai\" and \"Rupai\". Both were playing near the lake over the hilly area. Suddenly they both fell in the lake; that lake was later named \"Sonai Rupai Talab\". It is said that the water of that lake never dries and there are two fish on very bottom of that Lake. One fish is of gold and another one is of silver.

He won two bronze medals at the [[FIBT World Championships]] with one in [[FIBT World Championships 2007|2007]] (men's skeleton) and one in [[FIBT World Championships 2008|2008]] (mixed bobsleigh-skeleton team event). He finished #1 in World Cup standings in 2007.  Zach\u2019s huge success in Skeleton made his less famous nephew, Seth Gillespie, of Roosevelt, Utah, dream of becoming a \u201cSkeletor\u201d.\n\n==Personal life==\nZach was born and raised in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. He is the youngest of 5 children. Zach currently attends Westminster College, Salt Lake City UT, and graduated from the Judge Memorial Catholic High School in 1998.\n\n==Doping controversy==\nLund took part in the [[2005\u201306 Skeleton World Cup|200\u201306 Skeleton World Cup]], but did not compete in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] due to disqualification for using [[finasteride]], a drug that was removed from the banned list three years later.<ref name=\"scpr\">http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/02/09/skeleton-racer-hopes-for-redemption-in-vancouver/</ref> He was stripped of his second-place finish in the [[Calgary]] World Cup event after testing positive for this medication, and a one-year suspension was issued on February 10, 2006.\n\nLund said he was using finasteride to combat [[baldness]] and that he declared the use of the substance on medical forms. Records show that Lund had been using finasteride (in its commercial hair-restoration form, [[Propecia]]) for seven years until his suspension.<ref name=\"scpr\" />\n\nFinasteride has been on the banned list since 2005; Lund claims he last checked the list in 2004. \"I've been losing my hair since I was a teenager and I've had a prescription for the last seven years and it was never an issue until this year,\" Lund told freestyle skiing analyst Nikki Stone (''Yahoo! Sports'', Feb. 10, 2006). \"Whenever I've been tested, I always let them know that I was taking [Propecia]. I never had anything to hide.\"\n\nA panel on the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] believed Lund and wrote in its ruling that \"it was entirely satisfied that Mr. Lund was not a cheat...But, unfortunately, in 2005, he made a mistake.\"\n\nHe returned to the World Cup circuit in 2006 and won the [[List of Skeleton World Cup champions|overall World Cup title]] for the [[2006\u201307 Skeleton World Cup|2006\u201307 season]].\n\nAlpha-reductase inhibitors, a class of masking agents which used to be banned in- and out-of-competition, were removed from the 2009 list. This class of substances, which includes for example finasteride, has been rendered ineffective as masking agents of steroids through close consideration of steroid profiles by antidoping laboratories.
