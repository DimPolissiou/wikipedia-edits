It was originally released in February 1997 on [[Arista Records]]. The album showcases an [[electronica]]-influenced sound partly inspired by the [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[drum and bass]] culture of the 1990s.<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>{{citation | title=Changes 2.1 | first=Joe | last=Gore | journal=[[Guitar Player]] | date=June 1997| pages=45\u201358}}</ref>\n\n==Background and development==\nBowie returned to the studio five days after finishing the [[Outside Tour|tour]] for his previous album, ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|1. Outside]]'' (1995). About a week after the album's release, Bowie told an interviewer, \"I really thought it would be great if we could do a photo, almost a sonic photograph of what we were like at that time. So, [[Reeves Gabrels|Reeves [Gabrels]]] and I started writing immediately after we finished on the road.\"<ref name=Bowie50>{{Citation| last=Laban| first=Linda| title=Bowie Hits a Fab 50 | journal=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=13 February 1997 | pages=E3}}</ref> Despite going into the studio with no material ready,<ref name=RayGun97 /> the album took only {{frac|2|1|2}} weeks to record<ref name=Bowie50 /> (typical for a Bowie album).<ref name=MMReview>{{Citation | last=Isler| first=Scott| title=David Bowie Opens Up \u2013 A Little | journal=Musician| issue=106|date=August 1987 | pages=60\u201373}}</ref> Bowie compared it to 1980's ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'': \"I think there's quite a link between ''Scary Monsters'' and this album, to a certain extent. Certainly, the same intensity of aggression.\"<ref name=Fi>\"David Bowie: The FI Interview\" by J.D. Considine, Fi magazine, October 1997, pp 36\u201341</ref> Bowie described the album as an effort \"to produce some really dynamic, aggressive-sounding material.\"<ref name=Bowie50 />\n\n\"Unlike most [[drum and bass]] things,\" he noted, \"we didn't just take parts from other people's records and sample them. On the snare drum stuff, [[Zack Alford|Zac [Alford]]] went away and did his own loops and worked out all kinds of strange timings and rhythms. Then we speeded those up to your regular 160 beats per minute. That's very much how we treat the album. We kept all sampling in-house and created our own soundscape in a way.\"<ref name=Bowie50 />\n\n''Earthling'' was the first Bowie album recorded entirely digitally, \"entirely on [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]].\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 /> During interviews promoting the album, Bowie said, \"I did nearly everything on the guitar. A lot of screechy-scrawly stuff was done on saxophone, then transferred to sampler, and then distorted and worked on the synthesizer.\"<ref name=Fi />\n\nBowie and Gabrels used a technique they'd started while working on ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|1. Outside]]'': transferring bits of guitar to a sampling keyboard and constructing riffs from those pieces. \"It's real guitar,\" said Bowie, \"but constructed in a synthetic way. But [[Brian Eno]] got in the way \u2013 in the nicest possible way \u2013 so we didn't get to that until this album. We want to go further with that, because it's a very exciting idea.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 /> Bowie considered this album, along with its predecessor, to be a \"textural diary\" of what the last few years of the millennium felt like.<ref name=AX95>{{Citation | last=Paul | first=George A. | title=Bowie Outside Looking In | journal=Axcess Magazine | volume=3 | issue=5 | year=1995 | pages=60\u201362}}</ref>\n\nBowie's and Gabrels' influences had a big impact on the album: Bowie was influenced by a \"euro\" sound and bands like [[the Prodigy]], while Gabrels was into American [[Industrial music]] and bands like [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]].<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 />\n\n:{{quote|\"There was talk that the album was jumping on the drum 'n' bass bandwagon, but it's more influenced by what came to be called [[electronica]]. David loved [[Photek]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]]. Those influences were in the air at the time. I never told David this, but in my head I was thinking more of '[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]' \u2013 the muscular rock band with sequential information\u2026 It's my favourite record that I did with David. We did have a sense while we were doing it that we were making something we hadn't heard.\" \u2013 [[Reeves Gabrels]]<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Bill|last=DeMain|title=Reeves Gabrels talks about David Bowie|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|issue=247|date=April 2018|page=58}}</ref>}}\n\n\"(For ''[[Young Americans]]'') I wanted to work within the [[Philadelphia soul]] experience, and the only way that I knew was to bring what's thoroughly European about me to this intrinsically black American format,\" Bowie noted. \"And this [album was] not a dissimilar situation. It was the hybridizing of the European and the American sensibilities, and for me, that's exciting. That's what I do best. I'm a synthesist.<ref name=Live97>{{Citation | last=Pond | first=Steve | title=Beyond Bowie | journal=Live! Magazine | volume=2 |issue=2 |date=March 1997}}</ref>\n\n\"I guess the common ground with all the songs is this abiding need in me to vacillate between [[atheism]] or a kind of [[gnosticism]],\" he said. \"I keep going backwards and forwards between the two things, because they mean a lot in my life. I mean, the church doesn't enter into my writing, or my thought; I have no empathy with any organised religions. What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise.

He was hemmed in by the chord until it changed, and that made his run-up most unorthodox.\" The guitar riff used for the track \"Dead Man Walking\" was based on a pattern [[Jimmy Page]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]) had played for Bowie back in the '60s. According to Gabrels, part of the bass track on \"Little Wonder\" was a recording of bassist [[Gail Ann Dorsey]] as she tried to get a sound from her pedalboard while not knowing she was being recorded. For \"Battle for Britain\", Bowie challenged [[Mike Garson]] to play based on \"the idea from a piece of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] wrote called \"Ragtime for Eleven Instruments\". I said 'If you could kind of get into the character of that...' and he did it immediately.\"<ref name=Fi />\n\n\"[[Little Wonder (song)|Little Wonder]]\" was one of the first tracks Bowie and Gabrels wrote for the album,<ref name=Fi /> and Bowie called writing the track a \"ridiculous\" exercise in pure stream of consciousness. \"I just picked [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]] and made a line for each of the dwarves' names. And that's the song [laughs]. And then I ran out of dwarves' names, so there's new dwarves in it like 'Stinky'.\"<ref name=RayGun97>{{Citation | last=Kuipers | first=Dean | title=David Bowie: Is There Life on Earth? | journal=Raygun Magazine | issue=44 |date=March 1997}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Bowie thought he'd only have a few new songs for the album, and had intended to fill out the album with remakes of some of his past songs, including \"Dead Against It\" (from his 1993 \"soundtrack\" ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (album)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]''), \"[[I Can't Read]]\" and \"[[Baby Universal]]\" from his time with [[Tin Machine]], and \"[[Bring Me the Disco King]]\", which he'd tried his hand at once before in 1993 for his ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]'' album.<ref name=\"A2A\">{{cite book | title=Ashes to Ashes The Songs of David Bowie 1976\u20132016 | first=Chris | last=O'Leary | publisher=[[Repeater Books]]  | year=2019 | isbn=9781912248308}}</ref> But, due to his unexpectedly prolific songwriting during the sessions, none of these songs were released on the album, although Bowie did in fact record new versions of \"Bring Me the Disco King\" and \"Baby Universal\".<ref name=\"A2A\" /> Of the latter, Bowie said \"I thought [it] was a really good song and I don't think it got heard.

It was originally released in February 1997 on [[Arista Records]]. The album showcases an [[electronica]]-influenced sound partly inspired by the [[Industrial music|industrial]] and [[drum and bass]] culture of the 1990s.<ref name=GuitarPlayer97>{{citation | title=Changes 2.1 | first=Joe | last=Gore | journal=[[Guitar Player]] | date=June 1997| pages=45\u201358}}</ref>\n\n==Background and development==\nBowie returned to the studio five days after finishing the [[Outside Tour|tour]] for his previous album, ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|1. Outside]]'' (1995). About a week after the album's release, Bowie told an interviewer, \"I really thought it would be great if we could do a photo, almost a sonic photograph of what we were like at that time. So, [[Reeves Gabrels|Reeves [Gabrels]]] and I started writing immediately after we finished on the road.\"<ref name=Bowie50>{{Citation| last=Laban| first=Linda| title=Bowie Hits a Fab 50 | journal=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=13 February 1997 | pages=E3}}</ref> Despite going into the studio with no material ready,<ref name=RayGun97 /> the album took only {{frac|2|1|2}} weeks to record<ref name=Bowie50 /> (typical for a Bowie album).<ref name=MMReview>{{Citation | last=Isler| first=Scott| title=David Bowie Opens Up \u2013 A Little | journal=Musician| issue=106|date=August 1987 | pages=60\u201373}}</ref> Bowie compared it to 1980's ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]'': \"I think there's quite a link between ''Scary Monsters'' and this album, to a certain extent. Certainly, the same intensity of aggression.\"<ref name=Fi>\"David Bowie: The FI Interview\" by J.D. Considine, Fi magazine, October 1997, pp 36\u201341</ref> Bowie described the album as an effort \"to produce some really dynamic, aggressive-sounding material.\"<ref name=Bowie50 />\n\n\"Unlike most [[drum and bass]] things,\" he noted, \"we didn't just take parts from other people's records and sample them. On the snare drum stuff, [[Zack Alford|Zac [Alford]]] went away and did his own loops and worked out all kinds of strange timings and rhythms. Then we speeded those up to your regular 160 beats per minute. That's very much how we treat the album. We kept all sampling in-house and created our own soundscape in a way.\"<ref name=Bowie50 />\n\n''Earthling'' was the first Bowie album recorded entirely digitally, \"entirely on [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]].\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 /> During interviews promoting the album, Bowie said, \"I did nearly everything on the guitar. A lot of screechy-scrawly stuff was done on saxophone, then transferred to sampler, and then distorted and worked on the synthesizer.\"<ref name=Fi />\n\nBowie and Gabrels used a technique they'd started while working on ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|1. Outside]]'': transferring bits of guitar to a sampling keyboard and constructing riffs from those pieces. \"It's real guitar,\" said Bowie, \"but constructed in a synthetic way. But [[Brian Eno]] got in the way \u2013 in the nicest possible way \u2013 so we didn't get to that until this album. We want to go further with that, because it's a very exciting idea.\"<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 /> Bowie considered this album, along with its predecessor, to be a \"textural diary\" of what the last few years of the millennium felt like.<ref name=AX95>{{Citation | last=Paul | first=George A. | title=Bowie Outside Looking In | journal=Axcess Magazine | volume=3 | issue=5 | year=1995 | pages=60\u201362}}</ref>\n\nBowie's and Gabrels' influences had a big impact on the album: Bowie was influenced by a \"euro\" sound and bands like [[the Prodigy]], while Gabrels was into American [[Industrial music]] and bands like [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]].<ref name=GuitarPlayer97 />\n\n:{{quote|\"There was talk that the album was jumping on the drum 'n' bass bandwagon, but it's more influenced by what came to be called [[electronica]]. David loved [[Photek]] and [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]]. Those influences were in the air at the time. I never told David this, but in my head I was thinking more of '[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]' \u2013 the muscular rock band with sequential information\u2026 It's my favourite record that I did with David. We did have a sense while we were doing it that we were making something we hadn't heard.\" \u2013 [[Reeves Gabrels]]<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Bill|last=DeMain|title=Reeves Gabrels talks about David Bowie|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|issue=247|date=April 2018|page=58}}</ref>}}\n\n\"(For ''[[Young Americans]]'') I wanted to work within the [[Philadelphia soul]] experience, and the only way that I knew was to bring what's thoroughly European about me to this intrinsically black American format,\" Bowie noted. \"And this [album was] not a dissimilar situation. It was the hybridizing of the European and the American sensibilities, and for me, that's exciting. That's what I do best. I'm a synthesist.<ref name=Live97>{{Citation | last=Pond | first=Steve | title=Beyond Bowie | journal=Live! Magazine | volume=2 |issue=2 |date=March 1997}}</ref>\n\n\"I guess the common ground with all the songs is this abiding need in me to vacillate between [[atheism]] or a kind of [[gnosticism]],\" he said. \"I keep going backwards and forwards between the two things, because they mean a lot in my life. I mean, the church doesn't enter into my writing, or my thought; I have no empathy with any organised religions. What I need is to find a balance, spiritually, with the way I live and my demise. And that period of time \u2013 from today until my demise \u2013 is the only thing that fascinates me.<ref name=Q97X>{{Citation | last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref>\n\nThe album cover showcases a [[Union Jack]]-based coat by [[Alexander McQueen]], who had designed stage costumes for Bowie and his band.<ref name=CNN13>{{citation | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/22/showbiz/uk-david-bowie-exhibition | title=Bowie exhibition charts life of pop's ultimate Starman | accessdate=10 April 2013 | last=Wilkinson | first=Peter | work=CNN | date=22 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBefore the album was released, Bowie considered using ''Earthlings'' (plural) for its title.<ref name=YTE96>{{YouTube|id=dBKLcINEs-c|title=David Bowie- Little Wonder (Pre-Earthling Live Version at D.C. 1996)}}</ref>\n\n==Song development==\nBowie and the band continued their experimental approach to making music, first used in the [[Berlin Trilogy]]: for the track \"Looking for Satellites\", Bowie told guitarist Gabrels that he \"only wanted him to play on one string at a time. ... He was hemmed in by the chord until it changed, and that made his run-up most unorthodox.\" The guitar riff used for the track \"Dead Man Walking\" was based on a pattern [[Jimmy Page]] (of [[Led Zeppelin]]) had played for Bowie back in the '60s. According to Gabrels, part of the bass track on \"Little Wonder\" was a recording of bassist [[Gail Ann Dorsey]] as she tried to get a sound from her pedalboard while not knowing she was being recorded. For \"Battle for Britain\", Bowie challenged [[Mike Garson]] to play based on \"the idea from a piece of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] wrote called \"Ragtime for Eleven Instruments\". I said 'If you could kind of get into the character of that...' and he did it immediately.\"<ref name=Fi />\n\n\"[[Little Wonder (song)|Little Wonder]]\" was one of the first tracks Bowie and Gabrels wrote for the album,<ref name=Fi /> and Bowie called writing the track a \"ridiculous\" exercise in pure stream of consciousness. \"I just picked [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]] and made a line for each of the dwarves' names. And that's the song [laughs]. And then I ran out of dwarves' names, so there's new dwarves in it like 'Stinky'.\"<ref name=RayGun97>{{Citation | last=Kuipers | first=Dean | title=David Bowie: Is There Life on Earth? | journal=Raygun Magazine | issue=44 |date=March 1997}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Bowie thought he'd only have a few new songs for the album, and had intended to fill out the album with remakes of some of his past songs, including \"Dead Against It\" (from his 1993 \"soundtrack\" ''[[The Buddha of Suburbia (album)|The Buddha of Suburbia]]''), \"[[I Can't Read]]\" and \"[[Baby Universal]]\" from his time with [[Tin Machine]], and \"[[Bring Me the Disco King]]\", which he'd tried his hand at once before in 1993 for his ''[[Black Tie White Noise]]'' album.<ref name=\"A2A\">{{cite book | title=Ashes to Ashes The Songs of David Bowie 1976\u20132016 | first=Chris | last=O'Leary | publisher=[[Repeater Books]]  | year=2019 | isbn=9781912248308}}</ref> But, due to his unexpectedly prolific songwriting during the sessions, none of these songs were released on the album, although Bowie did in fact record new versions of \"Bring Me the Disco King\" and \"Baby Universal\".<ref name=\"A2A\" /> Of the latter, Bowie said \"I thought [it] was a really good song and I don't think it got heard.

There might be a story there that might be worth exploring. Obviously that would be a story that's not in the book, it would be a freestanding story, but obviously within the same universe. So, there might be something interesting out of it.

Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there's only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie.
