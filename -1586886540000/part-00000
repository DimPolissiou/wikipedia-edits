She remained on these duties until May 1940, when the German [[Battle of France|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[France]] began and she came under the [[Commander-in-Chief, Dover]] to support the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel from Europe as German ground forces advanced. On 24 May, she was assigned to [[Operation Dynamo]], the [[Evacuation of Dunkirk|evacuation]] of Allied troops from [[Dunkirk]], France, during which she made six trips to the Dunkirk beaches, transported a total of 4,350 troops to the United Kingdom, and suffered damage in a German air attack on 27 May 1940.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' was under repair during June 1940 &ndash; the month in which her pennant number was changed to I96 &ndash; but in July 1940 she returned to service with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, now based at [[Harwich]], for convoy escort and patrol operations in the [[North Sea]]. In August 1940 she was transferred to [[Western Approaches Command]] for convoy defence duty in the [[Western Approaches]], which she continued without major incident through the end of 1940.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n====1941\u201342====\n\nIn January 1941, ''Worcester'' transferred back to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich for more North Sea convoy escort and patrol work, this time with ''Whitshed'' and the destroyer leader {{HMS|Mackay|D70|6}} and destroyer {{HMS|Walpole|D41|6}}. In March 1941, she and ''Whitshed'' escorted [[Convoy FS 29]], which was steaming south along the east coast of [[Great Britain]] and came under German air attack on 6 March. On 7 March, she and ''Whitshed'' chased a German [[motor torpedo boat]] &ndash; an S-boat, known to the Allies as an \"[[E-boat]]\" &ndash; which had been detected near the convoy; the two destroyers were unable to make contact with it. Unfortunately for the convoy, the E-boat had been serving as a decoy for the German 1st S-Boote (E-boat) Flotilla, which attacked the convoy when ''Worcester'' and ''Whitshed'' were too far away to intervene. The Germans penetrated the remaining escort &ndash; reduced to only the escort destroyer {{HMS|Pytchley|L92|6}} and the [[sloop-of-war|patrol sloop]] {{HMS|Puffin|L52|6}} &ndash; to sink two of FS 29{{'}}s [[merchant ship]]s.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' continued her escort and patrol duties without significant incident until February 1942, when her flotilla was put on alert for the possibility that the German [[battlecruiser]]s [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and [[heavy cruiser]] [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen '']] would attempt a breakout from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in German-occupied France to move to a port in Germany. In preparation for opposing such a breakout, ''Worcester'', ''Mackay'', ''Walpole'', and ''Whitshed'' were conducting exercises with the destroyer leader {{HMS|Campbell|D60|6}} and destroyer {{HMS|Vivacious|D36|6}} of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla to practise [[torpedo]] attacks against enemy ships when they received word on 12 February 1942 that the German ships were indeed steaming to Germany via the English Channel, [[Strait of Dover]], and North Sea in what was to become known as the \"[[Channel Dash]].\" The British ships were ordered to attack the German naval force. During her unsuccessful torpedo attack, ''Worcester'' was hit by 11-inch (280-mm) shells from the battlecruisers and 8-inch (203-mm) shells from ''Prinz Eugen'',<ref name=\"navalhistory\" /> suffering 26 killed or mortally wounded and 45 injured. Most of the dead are buried side by side at Shotley Naval Cemetery, opposite Worcester's Harwich moorings <ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1942-02FEB.htm|title = Casualty Lists of the Royal Navy and Dominion Navies \u2013 February 1942|date = |accessdate = 9 February 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The German gunfire inflicted severe structural damage on ''Worcester'', starting fires, flooding her No. 1 [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler room]], and causing her to go dead in the water. Her surviving crew managed to put out her fires, get back underway, and proceed to Parkeston Quay (Harwich) for repairs without the aid of [[Tugboat|tugs]].<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\nNominated for conversion to a Short-Range Escort, ''Worcester'' was under repair and conversion until August 1942. Returning to service in September 1942, she was assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] to support [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] during their voyages between the United Kingdom and the [[Kola Inlet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. On 16 September, she deployed with ''Venomous'', the destroyers {{HMS|Amazon|D39|6}}, {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, {{HMS|Echo|H23|6}} and {{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}}, and the escort destroyer {{HMS|Cowdray|L52|6}} for [[Operation Gearbox]], in which the ships established a refuelling base at [[Lowe Sound]] on [[Spitsbergen]] for Allied escort ships on the Arctic run. With the base established, ''Worcester'' departed Lowe Sound on 20 September with the destroyers {{HMS|Fury|H76|6}} and {{HMS|Impulsive|D11|6}} and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]] [[RFA Oligarch|RFA ''Oligarch'']] to join [[Convoy QP 14]] during its voyage from the Kola Inlet to [[Loch Ewe]], [[Scotland]]. She detached from QP 14 on 26 September.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' remained with the Home Fleet through December 1942. That month, she deployed with ''Montrose'' and the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Raider|H15|6}}, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] destroyer {{HMAS|Queenborough|G70|6}}, and the [[Polish Navy]] destroyer [[ORP Piorun (G65)|ORP ''Piorun'']] as the screen for the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} and {{HMS|Howe|32|6}} and the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Bermuda|52|6}} as they provided cover for [[Convoy RA 51]] as it steamed from the Kola Inlet to the United Kingdom in case German heavy warships attempted to interfere in its passage.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n====1943\u201345====\n\nIn January 1943, ''Worcester'' was released from duty with the Home Fleet. She returned to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich and in February 1943 resumed operations in the North Sea, escorting convoys and conducting interception patrols targeting German E-boats before they could launch attacks against Allied convoys. On 24 October 1943, she deployed off [[Norfolk]], [[England]], with ''Mackay'' and small craft of the Royal Navy [[Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy|Coastal Forces]] to intercept E-boats thought to be gathering for an attack on Convoys [[Convoy FN 1160|FN 1160]] and [[Convoy FS 1164|FS 1164]], steaming northbound and southbound, respectively, in the North Sea along the east coast of Great Britain. ''Worcester'', ''Mackay'', and the Coastal Forces craft engaged E-boats of the German 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla on 25 October 1943 off [[Cromer]], preventing them from attacking the convoys; four of the E-boats did not return to base at [[IJmuiden]] in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' continued her escort and interception operations until 23 December 1943 when she detonated a [[Naval mine|mine]] in the North Sea near [[Geography of the North Sea|Smith's Knoll]]. The mine destroyed her [[Stern (ship)|stern]] structure, and she was towed to [[Great Yarmouth]]. She was under repair and survey until April 1944, when she was deemed beyond economical repair and was decommissioned.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\nIn May 1944, ''Worcester'' was selected for use as an [[accommodation ship]] in [[London]] upon completion of repairs and modification for her new role. In January 1945 she was towed to London, and after local preparation for use as an accommodation ship, was recommissioned with the new name HMS ''Yeoman'', the second Royal Navy ship of the name, in June 1945. She remained in service as such after the [[surrender of Japan]] brought World War II to an end in August 1945.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n==Decommissioning and disposal==\n\n''Yeoman'' remained in use as an accommodation ship until placed on the disposal list in 1946. She was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] on 17 September 1946 to the [[British Iron & Steel Corporation]] (BISCO), which allocated her to [[Thos W Ward]] to be broken up.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/><ref name=\"colledge\"/><ref name=\"navalhistorywwi\"/> She was towed to the shipbreaker{{'}}s yard at [[Grays, Essex|Grays]], [[Essex]], England, in February 1947.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/><ref name=\"colledge\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cernuschi |first1=Enrico |last2=Grobmeier |first2=Alvin H. |title=Question 5/98: Damage to British destroyer Campbell |journal=Warship International |date=1999 |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=194\u2013195 |issn=0043-0374|lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{cite book|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|editor1-last=Chesneau|editor1-first=Roger|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=Greenwich, UK|year=1980|isbn=0-85177-146-7}}\n*{{Colledge}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Maurice |last1=Cocker |first2=Ian |last2=Allan |title=Destroyers of the Royal Navy, 1893\u20131981 |isbn=0-7110-1075-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Destroyers From Earliest Days to the Second World War|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|year=2009|isbn=978-1-59114-081-8}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Gardiner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Gray|editor2-first=Randal|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906\u20131921|year=1985|location=Annapolis, Maryland|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-85177-245-5|lastauthoramp=y}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lenton|first=H.

She remained on these duties until May 1940, when the German [[Battle of France|invasion]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[France]] began and she came under the [[Commander-in-Chief, Dover]] to support the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] personnel from Europe as German ground forces advanced. On 24 May, she was assigned to [[Operation Dynamo]], the [[Evacuation of Dunkirk|evacuation]] of Allied troops from [[Dunkirk]], France, during which she made six trips to the Dunkirk beaches, transported a total of 4,350 troops to the United Kingdom, and suffered damage in a German air attack on 27 May 1940.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' was under repair during June 1940 &ndash; the month in which her pennant number was changed to I96 &ndash; but in July 1940 she returned to service with the 16th Destroyer Flotilla, now based at [[Harwich]], for convoy escort and patrol operations in the [[North Sea]]. In August 1940 she was transferred to [[Western Approaches Command]] for convoy defence duty in the [[Western Approaches]], which she continued without major incident through the end of 1940.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n====1941\u201342====\n\nIn January 1941, ''Worcester'' transferred back to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich for more North Sea convoy escort and patrol work, this time with ''Whitshed'' and the destroyer leader {{HMS|Mackay|D70|6}} and destroyer {{HMS|Walpole|D41|6}}. In March 1941, she and ''Whitshed'' escorted [[Convoy FS 29]], which was steaming south along the east coast of [[Great Britain]] and came under German air attack on 6 March. On 7 March, she and ''Whitshed'' chased a German [[motor torpedo boat]] &ndash; an S-boat, known to the Allies as an \"[[E-boat]]\" &ndash; which had been detected near the convoy; the two destroyers were unable to make contact with it. Unfortunately for the convoy, the E-boat had been serving as a decoy for the German 1st S-Boote (E-boat) Flotilla, which attacked the convoy when ''Worcester'' and ''Whitshed'' were too far away to intervene. The Germans penetrated the remaining escort &ndash; reduced to only the escort destroyer {{HMS|Pytchley|L92|6}} and the [[sloop-of-war|patrol sloop]] {{HMS|Puffin|L52|6}} &ndash; to sink two of FS 29{{'}}s [[merchant ship]]s.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' continued her escort and patrol duties without significant incident until February 1942, when her flotilla was put on alert for the possibility that the German [[battlecruiser]]s [[German battlecruiser Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battlecruiser Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']] and [[heavy cruiser]] [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|''Prinz Eugen '']] would attempt a breakout from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in German-occupied France to move to a port in Germany. In preparation for opposing such a breakout, ''Worcester'', ''Mackay'', ''Walpole'', and ''Whitshed'' were conducting exercises with the destroyer leader {{HMS|Campbell|D60|6}} and destroyer {{HMS|Vivacious|D36|6}} of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla to practise [[torpedo]] attacks against enemy ships when they received word on 12 February 1942 that the German ships were indeed steaming to Germany via the English Channel, [[Strait of Dover]], and North Sea in what was to become known as the \"[[Channel Dash]].\" The British ships were ordered to attack the German naval force. During her unsuccessful torpedo attack, ''Worcester'' was hit by 11-inch (280-mm) shells from the battlecruisers and 8-inch (203-mm) shells from ''Prinz Eugen'',<ref name=\"navalhistory\" /> suffering 26 killed or mortally wounded and 45 injured. Most of the dead are buried side by side at Shotley Naval Cemetery, opposite Worcester's Harwich moorings <ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.naval-history.net/xDKCas1942-02FEB.htm|title = Casualty Lists of the Royal Navy and Dominion Navies \u2013 February 1942|date = |accessdate = 9 February 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> The German gunfire inflicted severe structural damage on ''Worcester'', starting fires, flooding her No. 1 [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler room]], and causing her to go dead in the water.

Returning to service in September 1942, she was assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] at [[Scapa Flow]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] to support [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]] during their voyages between the United Kingdom and the [[Kola Inlet]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. On 16 September, she deployed with ''Venomous'', the destroyers {{HMS|Amazon|D39|6}}, {{HMS|Bulldog|H91|6}}, {{HMS|Echo|H23|6}} and {{HMS|Windsor|D42|6}}, and the escort destroyer {{HMS|Cowdray|L52|6}} for [[Operation Gearbox]], in which the ships established a refuelling base at [[Lowe Sound]] on [[Spitsbergen]] for Allied escort ships on the Arctic run. With the base established, ''Worcester'' departed Lowe Sound on 20 September with the destroyers {{HMS|Fury|H76|6}} and {{HMS|Impulsive|D11|6}} and the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] [[Oiler (ship)|oiler]] [[RFA Oligarch|RFA ''Oligarch'']] to join [[Convoy QP 14]] during its voyage from the Kola Inlet to [[Loch Ewe]], [[Scotland]]. She detached from QP 14 on 26 September.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' remained with the Home Fleet through December 1942. That month, she deployed with ''Montrose'' and the destroyers {{HMS|Musketeer|G86|6}} and {{HMS|Raider|H15|6}}, the [[Royal Australian Navy]] destroyer {{HMAS|Queenborough|G70|6}}, and the [[Polish Navy]] destroyer [[ORP Piorun (G65)|ORP ''Piorun'']] as the screen for the [[battleship]]s {{HMS|King George V|41|6}} and {{HMS|Howe|32|6}} and the [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Bermuda|52|6}} as they provided cover for [[Convoy RA 51]] as it steamed from the Kola Inlet to the United Kingdom in case German heavy warships attempted to interfere in its passage.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n====1943\u201345====\n\nIn January 1943, ''Worcester'' was released from duty with the Home Fleet. She returned to the 16th Destroyer Flotilla at Harwich and in February 1943 resumed operations in the North Sea, escorting convoys and conducting interception patrols targeting German E-boats before they could launch attacks against Allied convoys. On 24 October 1943, she deployed off [[Norfolk]], [[England]], with ''Mackay'' and small craft of the Royal Navy [[Coastal Forces of the Royal Navy|Coastal Forces]] to intercept E-boats thought to be gathering for an attack on Convoys [[Convoy FN 1160|FN 1160]] and [[Convoy FS 1164|FS 1164]], steaming northbound and southbound, respectively, in the North Sea along the east coast of Great Britain. ''Worcester'', ''Mackay'', and the Coastal Forces craft engaged E-boats of the German 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla on 25 October 1943 off [[Cromer]], preventing them from attacking the convoys; four of the E-boats did not return to base at [[IJmuiden]] in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n''Worcester'' continued her escort and interception operations until 23 December 1943 when she detonated a [[Naval mine|mine]] in the North Sea near [[Geography of the North Sea|Smith's Knoll]]. The mine destroyed her [[Stern (ship)|stern]] structure, and she was towed to [[Great Yarmouth]]. She was under repair and survey until April 1944, when she was deemed beyond economical repair and was decommissioned.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\nIn May 1944, ''Worcester'' was selected for use as an [[accommodation ship]] in [[London]] upon completion of repairs and modification for her new role. In January 1945 she was towed to London, and after local preparation for use as an accommodation ship, was recommissioned with the new name HMS ''Yeoman'', the second Royal Navy ship of the name, in June 1945. She remained in service as such after the [[surrender of Japan]] brought World War II to an end in August 1945.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/>\n\n==Decommissioning and disposal==\n\n''Yeoman'' remained in use as an accommodation ship until placed on the disposal list in 1946. She was sold for [[Ship breaking|scrapping]] on 17 September 1946 to the [[British Iron & Steel Corporation]] (BISCO), which allocated her to [[Thos W Ward]] to be broken up.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/><ref name=\"colledge\"/><ref name=\"navalhistorywwi\"/> She was towed to the shipbreaker{{'}}s yard at [[Grays]], [[Essex]], England, in February 1947.<ref name=\"navalhistory\"/><ref name=\"colledge\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cernuschi |first1=Enrico |last2=Grobmeier |first2=Alvin H. |title=Question 5/98: Damage to British destroyer Campbell |journal=Warship International |date=1999 |volume=XXXVI |issue=2 |pages=194\u2013195 |issn=0043-0374|lastauthoramp=y}}\n*{{cite book|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|editor1-last=Chesneau|editor1-first=Roger|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=Greenwich, UK|year=1980|isbn=0-85177-146-7}}\n*{{Colledge}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Maurice |last1=Cocker |first2=Ian |last2=Allan |title=Destroyers of the Royal Navy, 1893\u20131981 |isbn=0-7110-1075-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Destroyers From Earliest Days to the Second World War|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|year=2009|isbn=978-1-59114-081-8}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Gardiner|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Gray|editor2-first=Randal|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships: 1906\u20131921|year=1985|location=Annapolis, Maryland|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-85177-245-5|lastauthoramp=y}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lenton|first=H.

Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation.<ref name=Powlesland>{{cite journal|last=Powlesland|first=R.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter. Fossils of New Zealand robins can sometimes be found near pit fall deposits, as they do most of their feeding/foraging on the ground.<ref name=Worthy>{{cite book|last1=Worthy|first1=Trevor H.|last2=Holdaway|first2=Richard N.|year=2002|chapter=Shorebirds, Parrots and Passerines|title=The Lost World of the Moa|pages=410\u2013440}}</ref> The fossil record also indicates the robins' presence throughout lowland New Zealand until drastic habitat reduction through deforestation by the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] ancestors of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] and later European colonisers.<ref name=Borkin>{{cite journal|last=Borkin|first=K.

As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times.

Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas.

During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an [[Rainforest#Emergent layer|emergent]] tree.<ref name=PowleslandA/> Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the [[Dawn chorus (birds)|dawn chorus]] as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours such as singing to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=S.

A pumping station pumped the water to a reservoir on Cambridge Road. In 1871, the Southend Waterworks Company Limited was formed, and bought the works. The company became a [[statutory undertaker]] in 1879,<ref>Southend Waterworks Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c.cxx)</ref>{{sfn |SWC |1948}} which restricted the amount of money they could borrow, the profits they could retain and the dividend payable to shareholders,{{sfn |Ofwat |2006 |p=6}} but gave them powers to lay pipes beneath public streets and on private land.\n\nBy 1924, the company were supplying an area of {{convert|160|sqmi|km2}} bounded on the south by the [[River Thames]], on the north by the [[River Crouch]], and stretching westwards to the outskirts of [[Shenfield]]. As the volume of water required increased, additional wells were sunk, until there were 36 wells or boreholes in operation. They penetrated a layer of London clay near the surface, and continued into the sands of the Lower London tertiary deposits below that, but the yields obtained were generally poor and gradually diminished over time. In 1921 the company started to look at extracting water from rivers, but failed to obtain parliamentary approval for a joint scheme with the South Essex Waterworks Company to obtain water from the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] on the border between Essex and Suffolk. They therefore developed a scheme to extract water from the [[River Blackwater, Essex|River Blackwater]], the [[River Chelmer]] and its tributary, the [[River Ter]]. An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained in August 1924,<ref>Southend Waterworks Act 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. 5 c.lxii)</ref> to enable construction of Langford Works, to the west of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]].{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nThe project involved the construction of intakes on the Chelmer and Ter, so that water from either or both could be fed into a concrete pipeline which was {{convert|33|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long. The water flowed by gravity along the pipeline to two sedimentation reservoirs each covering {{convert|10.1|acre|ha}} and capable of holding {{convert|30|e6impgal|Ml}}. Water from the Blackwater intake at Langford Mill is pumped to the sedimentation reservoirs. From there the water flows by gravity to the Langford pumping station. In order to maintain the quality of the water, effluent discharged from the [[Chelmsford]] sewage treatment works on the Chelmer and the [[Witham]] sewage treatment works on the Blackwater was piped to new outfalls below the intakes.{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nWhen built, the Langford pumping station contained two triple-expansion steam engines, with room for a third, which was fitted in 1931.{{sfn|Chaplin|Allen|2011}} There were used in pairs, and each drove a low lift pump to transfer water to the treatment works, and a high lift pump to take treated water and pump it along a {{convert|28|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cast iron]] pipe to Southend. The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at [[Hullbridge]], where shafts were built on either side of the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver {{convert|8|e6impgal|Ml}} per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a backup supply when necessary.{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nIn 1960, work began on replacing the steam engines at Langford pumping station with semi-automatic electric pumps. The project cost \u00a3260,000, and was formally inaugurated on 31 October 1963, when Sir George Chaplin, the Chairman of [[Essex County Council]] switched on the new pumps. In the late 1960s, construction of a new treatment works next to the storage reservoirs began. The works cost \u00a31.5 million, and were opened on 30 June 1970. They can produce {{convert|12|e6impgal|Ml}} of treated water per day. Earlier that year, the Essex Water Order<ref>Essex Water Order 1970 S.I. 1970/786: Regrouping Order: transfer of the water undertakings of certain local authorities and the Southend Waterworks Company to the South Essex Waterworks Company</ref> was passed by Parliament, and on 1 April Southend Waterworks Company amalgamated with South Essex Waterworks Company to become the Essex Water Company. Negotiations between Maldon District Council, Essex and Suffolk Water and other interested parties in 1996 resulted in the Langford pumping station and its one remaining engine, dating from 1931, becoming the fledgling [[Museum of Power]].{{sfn|Chaplin|Allen|2011}}\n\n===South Essex Waterworks Company===\nThe South Essex Waterworks Company was formed in 1861, and supplied drinking water to an area of {{convert|103|sqmi|km2}} stretching from [[Grays, Essex|Grays]] to [[East Ham]] and from [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] to the [[River Thames]]. Water was obtained from boreholes sunk into the chalk [[aquifer]] underlying the area, but by the time of the [[First World War]], these supplies were not sufficient to meet the demand for water, and so the company looked further afield. Following the failure of the joint scheme with Southend Waterworks Company, they obtained an Act of Parliament in 1928<ref>South Essex Waterworks Act 1928 (18 & 19 Geo. 5 c. lxxix)</ref> for a revised scheme which included a water treatment works at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]] with an intake from the River Stour. Treated water was pumped from the works to [[Tiptree]] works, and was pumped from there to a reservoir at [[Danbury, Essex|Danbury]]. It then flowed by gravity to another storage reservoir at [[Herongate]] and then into the distribution network. One condition of the Act was that the company had to supply water to other local authorities which were outside their original supply area.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=6-7}} \n\n[[File:Pumping Station - geograph.org.uk - 37807.jpg|thumb|The 1930s style pump house at Abberton Reservoir]]\nAlthough the Langham works could supply {{convert|12|e6impgal|Ml}} per day, and came online in 1932, they estimated that they would still be facing a shortage by the end of the decade. The company obtained another Act of Parliament in 1935<ref>South Essex Waterworks Act 1935 (25 & 26 Geo. 5 c. xlviii)</ref> for a second abstraction point on the Stour. This was located at [[Stratford St. Mary]], about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} downstream from the Langham intake. A pumping station pumped up to {{convert|35|e6impgal|Ml}} of water per day to the new [[Abberton Reservoir]], and a new treatment works was built at [[Layer de la Haye]] near its northern shore. Treated water was pumped to Tiptree, where it was blended with water from Langham.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=6-7}} The pipeline from Stratford St. Mary was {{convert|11|mi|km}} long, while Abberton Reservoir covers an area of {{convert|1210|acre|km2}} and lies in the valley of the Layer Brook. When full, it could hold {{convert|5700|e6impgal|Ml}}. Layer treatment works could process {{convert|125|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}} per day, and the system was designed to store water from winter rainfall for use in the summer months.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=4-5}}\n\nConstruction of the reservoir began in March 1936 and continued until the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. To pass under the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]], shafts were constructed on either side of the river, and a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter tunnel was excavated between the shafts. The miners worked in compressed air, and twin pipes of {{convert|32|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter were run through the tunnel. The original pipeline consisted of bitumen-lined steel tubes, some {{convert|34|in|cm}} and some {{convert|36|in|cm}} in diameter. A second pipeline of {{convert|40|and|42|in|cm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} diameter pipes was subsequently installed.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=10-11}} Filling of the reservoir began in 1939 and was completed by the end of 1940.{{sfn |ESW|2006|p=18}} Some minor commissioning work, including the Abberton pumping station, was delayed until the end of hostilities. The project cost \u00a3500,000. Many of the construction workers came from [[County Durham|Durham]], and some stayed on to run the works, including Stanley Aldridge, who had been the Engineer, and became the General Manager of the Layer works.{{sfn |ESW|2006|p=19}}\n\n===Joint projects===\n[[File:Sluice on Kirtling Brook, Great Bradley - geograph.org.uk - 47866.jpg|left|thumb|The sluice on Kirtling Brook, where water from the Great Ouse is discharged from the Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme into the River Stour system]]\nAlthough the Southend Waterworks Company and the South Essex Waterworks Company did not formally unite until 1970, they co-operated on two major projects prior to that date. These were the construction of Hanningfield Reservoir and the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme.\n\nThe construction of [[Hanningfield Reservoir]], which was authorised by the Hanningfield Water Order 1950,{{sfn|ESW|2006|p=22}} and began in 1951, was a joint venture between the two companies. It was built in the Sandon Valley, to the north of [[Wickford]], and covered the hamlet of Peasdown. A {{convert|1.25|mi|km|adj=on}} mass earth dam with a [[Puddling (engineering)|puddle clay]] core was built across the north-east edge of the site, and a new {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline was built from the Langford pumping station to supply the reservoir. The main contractors for the project were W&C French, and it took around 5 years to complete, with the treatment works beginning production in August 1956. The formal opening took place over a year later, when  [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], [[Member of parliament|MP]], the [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]], performed the ceremony in September 1957. The total cost of the project was \u00a36 million, and when full, the reservoir can hold {{convert|26075|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}}. If supplies around {{convert|150|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}} or treated water per day, although the maximum throughput of the works is {{convert|225|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}} per day.

Surplus water in the [[River Great Ouse]], which would otherwise flow into the sea, was to be diverted via a series of channels, tunnels and pipelines to augment supplies to the Abberton and Hanningfield reservoirs. At the northern end, the Cut Off Channel carries the headwaters of the [[River Lark]], the [[River Little Ouse]] and the [[River Wissey]] to the Great Ouse at Denver Sluice, when those rivers are in flood. An intake was constructed at Blackdyke, close to the Little Ouse, and a tunnel carries the water to a pumping station at [[Kennett, Cambridgeshire|Kennett]]. From there a {{convert|1.83|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on}} pipeline carries the water to [[Kirtling|Kirtling Green]] Outfall, where it enters Kirtling Brook, a tributary of the River Stour. Further down the Stour, some of the water is removed from the river by [[Wixoe]] pumping station. A {{convert|1.68|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on}} diameter pipeline carries it to the [[Great Sampford]] outfall, where it is discharged into the River Pant, the name of the upper reaches of the River Blackwater.{{sfn |ESW |2006 |p=22}} Construction of the scheme was completed in 1971.{{sfn |Barty-King |1992 |p=189}}\n\n===Suffolk Water plc===\nThe Great Yarmouth Waterworks Company was set up in 1853, authorised by the Great Yarmouth Waterworks Act of that year.

A pumping station pumped the water to a reservoir on Cambridge Road. In 1871, the Southend Waterworks Company Limited was formed, and bought the works. The company became a [[statutory undertaker]] in 1879,<ref>Southend Waterworks Act 1879 (42 & 43 Vict. c.cxx)</ref>{{sfn |SWC |1948}} which restricted the amount of money they could borrow, the profits they could retain and the dividend payable to shareholders,{{sfn |Ofwat |2006 |p=6}} but gave them powers to lay pipes beneath public streets and on private land.\n\nBy 1924, the company were supplying an area of {{convert|160|sqmi|km2}} bounded on the south by the [[River Thames]], on the north by the [[River Crouch]], and stretching westwards to the outskirts of [[Shenfield]]. As the volume of water required increased, additional wells were sunk, until there were 36 wells or boreholes in operation. They penetrated a layer of London clay near the surface, and continued into the sands of the Lower London tertiary deposits below that, but the yields obtained were generally poor and gradually diminished over time. In 1921 the company started to look at extracting water from rivers, but failed to obtain parliamentary approval for a joint scheme with the South Essex Waterworks Company to obtain water from the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] on the border between Essex and Suffolk. They therefore developed a scheme to extract water from the [[River Blackwater, Essex|River Blackwater]], the [[River Chelmer]] and its tributary, the [[River Ter]]. An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained in August 1924,<ref>Southend Waterworks Act 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. 5 c.lxii)</ref> to enable construction of Langford Works, to the west of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]].{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nThe project involved the construction of intakes on the Chelmer and Ter, so that water from either or both could be fed into a concrete pipeline which was {{convert|33|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} long. The water flowed by gravity along the pipeline to two sedimentation reservoirs each covering {{convert|10.1|acre|ha}} and capable of holding {{convert|30|e6impgal|Ml}}. Water from the Blackwater intake at Langford Mill is pumped to the sedimentation reservoirs. From there the water flows by gravity to the Langford pumping station. In order to maintain the quality of the water, effluent discharged from the [[Chelmsford]] sewage treatment works on the Chelmer and the [[Witham]] sewage treatment works on the Blackwater was piped to new outfalls below the intakes.{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nWhen built, the Langford pumping station contained two triple-expansion steam engines, with room for a third, which was fitted in 1931.{{sfn|Chaplin|Allen|2011}} There were used in pairs, and each drove a low lift pump to transfer water to the treatment works, and a high lift pump to take treated water and pump it along a {{convert|28|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cast iron]] pipe to Southend. The pipe crossed below the River Crouch at [[Hullbridge]], where shafts were built on either side of the river, and a tunnel was constructed between them. The water main is formed of twin steel tubes within the tunnel. The engines were normally worked in pairs, and a pair could deliver {{convert|8|e6impgal|Ml}} per day. In August 1927, water from the Chelmer started to be used, and between then and 1945, 96 per cent of the water supplied by Southend Waterworks came from Langford. The wells and boreholes were maintained, to provide a backup supply when necessary.{{sfn |SWC |1948}}\n\nIn 1960, work began on replacing the steam engines at Langford pumping station with semi-automatic electric pumps. The project cost \u00a3260,000, and was formally inaugurated on 31 October 1963, when Sir George Chaplin, the Chairman of [[Essex County Council]] switched on the new pumps. In the late 1960s, construction of a new treatment works next to the storage reservoirs began. The works cost \u00a31.5 million, and were opened on 30 June 1970. They can produce {{convert|12|e6impgal|Ml}} of treated water per day. Earlier that year, the Essex Water Order<ref>Essex Water Order 1970 S.I. 1970/786: Regrouping Order: transfer of the water undertakings of certain local authorities and the Southend Waterworks Company to the South Essex Waterworks Company</ref> was passed by Parliament, and on 1 April Southend Waterworks Company amalgamated with South Essex Waterworks Company to become the Essex Water Company. Negotiations between Maldon District Council, Essex and Suffolk Water and other interested parties in 1996 resulted in the Langford pumping station and its one remaining engine, dating from 1931, becoming the fledgling [[Museum of Power]].{{sfn|Chaplin|Allen|2011}}\n\n===South Essex Waterworks Company===\nThe South Essex Waterworks Company was formed in 1861, and supplied drinking water to an area of {{convert|103|sqmi|km2}} stretching from [[Grays]] to [[East Ham]] and from [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] to the [[River Thames]]. Water was obtained from boreholes sunk into the chalk [[aquifer]] underlying the area, but by the time of the [[First World War]], these supplies were not sufficient to meet the demand for water, and so the company looked further afield. Following the failure of the joint scheme with Southend Waterworks Company, they obtained an Act of Parliament in 1928<ref>South Essex Waterworks Act 1928 (18 & 19 Geo. 5 c. lxxix)</ref> for a revised scheme which included a water treatment works at [[Langham, Essex|Langham]] with an intake from the River Stour. Treated water was pumped from the works to [[Tiptree]] works, and was pumped from there to a reservoir at [[Danbury, Essex|Danbury]]. It then flowed by gravity to another storage reservoir at [[Herongate]] and then into the distribution network. One condition of the Act was that the company had to supply water to other local authorities which were outside their original supply area.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=6-7}} \n\n[[File:Pumping Station - geograph.org.uk - 37807.jpg|thumb|The 1930s style pump house at Abberton Reservoir]]\nAlthough the Langham works could supply {{convert|12|e6impgal|Ml}} per day, and came online in 1932, they estimated that they would still be facing a shortage by the end of the decade. The company obtained another Act of Parliament in 1935<ref>South Essex Waterworks Act 1935 (25 & 26 Geo. 5 c. xlviii)</ref> for a second abstraction point on the Stour. This was located at [[Stratford St. Mary]], about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} downstream from the Langham intake. A pumping station pumped up to {{convert|35|e6impgal|Ml}} of water per day to the new [[Abberton Reservoir]], and a new treatment works was built at [[Layer de la Haye]] near its northern shore. Treated water was pumped to Tiptree, where it was blended with water from Langham.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=6-7}} The pipeline from Stratford St. Mary was {{convert|11|mi|km}} long, while Abberton Reservoir covers an area of {{convert|1210|acre|km2}} and lies in the valley of the Layer Brook. When full, it could hold {{convert|5700|e6impgal|Ml}}. Layer treatment works could process {{convert|125|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}} per day, and the system was designed to store water from winter rainfall for use in the summer months.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=4-5}}\n\nConstruction of the reservoir began in March 1936 and continued until the start of the [[Second World War]] in 1939. To pass under the [[River Colne, Essex|River Colne]], shafts were constructed on either side of the river, and a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter tunnel was excavated between the shafts. The miners worked in compressed air, and twin pipes of {{convert|32|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter were run through the tunnel. The original pipeline consisted of bitumen-lined steel tubes, some {{convert|34|in|cm}} and some {{convert|36|in|cm}} in diameter. A second pipeline of {{convert|40|and|42|in|cm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} diameter pipes was subsequently installed.{{sfn |ESW|2006|pp=10-11}} Filling of the reservoir began in 1939 and was completed by the end of 1940.{{sfn |ESW|2006|p=18}} Some minor commissioning work, including the Abberton pumping station, was delayed until the end of hostilities. The project cost \u00a3500,000. Many of the construction workers came from [[County Durham|Durham]], and some stayed on to run the works, including Stanley Aldridge, who had been the Engineer, and became the General Manager of the Layer works.{{sfn |ESW|2006|p=19}}\n\n===Joint projects===\n[[File:Sluice on Kirtling Brook, Great Bradley - geograph.org.uk - 47866.jpg|left|thumb|The sluice on Kirtling Brook, where water from the Great Ouse is discharged from the Ely Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme into the River Stour system]]\nAlthough the Southend Waterworks Company and the South Essex Waterworks Company did not formally unite until 1970, they co-operated on two major projects prior to that date. These were the construction of Hanningfield Reservoir and the Ely-Ouse to Essex Transfer Scheme.\n\nThe construction of [[Hanningfield Reservoir]], which was authorised by the Hanningfield Water Order 1950,{{sfn|ESW|2006|p=22}} and began in 1951, was a joint venture between the two companies. It was built in the Sandon Valley, to the north of [[Wickford]], and covered the hamlet of Peasdown. A {{convert|1.25|mi|km|adj=on}} mass earth dam with a [[Puddling (engineering)|puddle clay]] core was built across the north-east edge of the site, and a new {{convert|9|mi|km|adj=on}} pipeline was built from the Langford pumping station to supply the reservoir. The main contractors for the project were W&C French, and it took around 5 years to complete, with the treatment works beginning production in August 1956. The formal opening took place over a year later, when  [[Henry Brooke, Baron Brooke of Cumnor|Henry Brooke]], [[Member of parliament|MP]], the [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]], performed the ceremony in September 1957. The total cost of the project was \u00a36 million, and when full, the reservoir can hold {{convert|26075|Ml|e6impgal|order=flip}}.

Surplus water in the [[River Great Ouse]], which would otherwise flow into the sea, was to be diverted via a series of channels, tunnels and pipelines to augment supplies to the Abberton and Hanningfield reservoirs. At the northern end, the Cut Off Channel carries the headwaters of the [[River Lark]], the [[River Little Ouse]] and the [[River Wissey]] to the Great Ouse at Denver Sluice, when those rivers are in flood. An intake was constructed at Blackdyke, close to the Little Ouse, and a tunnel carries the water to a pumping station at [[Kennett, Cambridgeshire|Kennett]]. From there a {{convert|1.83|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on}} pipeline carries the water to [[Kirtling|Kirtling Green]] Outfall, where it enters Kirtling Brook, a tributary of the River Stour. Further down the Stour, some of the water is removed from the river by [[Wixoe]] pumping station. A {{convert|1.68|m|ft|order=flip|adj=on}} diameter pipeline carries it to the [[Great Sampford]] outfall, where it is discharged into the River Pant, the name of the upper reaches of the River Blackwater.{{sfn |ESW |2006 |p=22}} Construction of the scheme was completed in 1971.{{sfn |Barty-King |1992 |p=189}}\n\n===Suffolk Water plc===\nThe Great Yarmouth Waterworks Company was set up in 1853, authorised by the Great Yarmouth Waterworks Act of that year.
