These movements both individually and collectively, have historically been small in their numbers and have not been well organised. With a culture of war in the early history of Germany, pacifism was not a culturally significant group. This was driven by the government as they attempted to use the media in order to promote the expansion of Germany as a growing empire.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\">{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn-Osius|first=Eckhard|date=2010|title=Germany's Lessons From the Lost \"Great War\": Pacifist Andreas Latzko and BellicistWalter Flex|journal=Peace Research|volume=42|pages=23\u201351}}</ref> The exception to this is during the Cold War with the Bonn demonstration with a large turnout of around 300,000 people.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\">{{Cite journal|last=Hoering|first=Uwe|date=March 1982|title=The Peace Movement in the Federal Republic of Germany|journal=Social Scientist|volume=10|issue=3|pages=56\u201363|doi=10.2307/3520251|jstor=3520251}}</ref> Christian peace groups have been the most consistent groups within the classification of pacifists as an opposition to violence is a key part of their faith. The size, whilst remaining small varies over the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The reception from the public regarding pacifists also changes depending on the historical period.\n\n== Historical Periods ==\n\n=== Imperial Germany (1871\u20131914) ===\nWith the unification of Germany as a single state, the country began to expand militarily as an international power, which in turn created a pacifist movement in Germany. This first movement was called the [[German Peace Society]] and was founded in 1892. However, the movement was small with only 10,000 active members at its peak,<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> as it did not resonate with the wider population who was in favour of the German expansion.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\">{{Cite journal|last=Shand|first=James|date=1975|title=Doves among the Eagles: German Pacifists and Their Government during World War I|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=10|pages=95\u2013108|doi=10.1177/002200947501000105}}</ref> With relatively low support the ability of the movement to grow was limited to the ability to speak freely which was later limited due to the government declaring a state of war. The rapid military expansion of Germany was also largely popular with the population. The movement, prior to the outbreak of war began to decline in support for the movement as the public support of a war grew and avoid a response from the government. During this time there were two Hague Peace Conferences, these conferences resulted in various multi-lateral treaties regarding military expansion and foreign policy.<ref name=\"Schlichtmann 2003\">{{Cite journal|last=Schlichtmann|first=Klaus|date=2003|title=Japan, Germany and the Idea of the Hague Peace Conferences|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=40|issue=4|pages=377\u2013394|doi=10.1177/00223433030404002}}</ref> The conference was also about establishing the universal values and therefore the obligations of states. In 1899 there was a Hauge Peace Conference, however, Germany did not attend, and it was not until the 1907 conference where Germany would participate. At this conference Germany was considered uncooperative, which was due to the restrictions on their ability to expand their military power.<ref name=\"Schlichtmann 2003\" /> Also, as Germany was a rising power there was a hesitation to reduce their expansion as it would restrict their self-defence capabilities.\n\n=== World War One Germany (1914\u20131918) ===\nGerman Pacifism was not as organised in this era when compared to that of Cold War Germany; however, a large number of groups adopted pacifist attitudes, which evolved throughout the war. During this period a group of female war opponents emerged, which was a pacifist group who were opposed to the war as it was, according to this group, caused by masculine values and attitudes. This group also overlapped with the group of advocates for women\u2019s\u2019 rights during the same period, as well as the socialist movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dollard|first=Catherine|date=2006|title=Martial Status and the Rhetoric of Women's Movement in World War I Germany|journal=Women in Germany Yearbook|volume=22|pages=211\u2013235|doi=10.1353/wgy.2006.0004}}</ref> This activism from female groups was the result of changing cultural, political and social roles of women which had developed during the war. Early in the war attitudes towards war were very positive, this along with the conscription of German soldiers resulted in the pacifists\u2019 movement remaining a relatively small group. As the country was in a state of war, the government was heavily involved in censorship of the population, so the pacifist publications were censored to not have views which directly opposed the government, rather they would be written in order to talk about the wider issue of war with other countries having the primary role at the beginning of war.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The government remained lenient towards those with pacifist attitudes which contrasts the government attitude of the Nazi Government and other governments which enacted the concept of total war on the home front. In 1915 at the Hague, the '''Women's Peace Conference''' met to discuss methods to end the war through negotiations. Attending this event was four German delegates. After this conference, the government began to restrict pacifists and their groups as there was a consensus that this conference had weakened the position of Germany for negotiations. Towards the end of the war, the public support massively declines, which resulted in an increase in the support for pacifist ideas, despite this the movement remained small in size. At this time the government tried to assert more control over the home front in order to provide more resources for soldiers on the front line. With the Russian Revolution, the pacifist movement also gained support and inspiration through the Marxist ideology behind the revolution.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> The literature during the war was restricted and the literature that was promoted all displayed similar views.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" /> These views support the war effort which was achieved through the justification of the war, as well as the celebration of acts of heroism and sacrifice. Pacifist literature was virtually non-existent during this time period which continued until the end of the war before it became more widely discussed in the literature.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" />\n\n=== World War Two Germany (1939\u20131945) ===\nThe existence of pacifists in Germany is at its lowest and least organised during this time, as a result of the Nazi Government\u2019s policies regarding movements which oppose their regime.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> Pacifists during this time are mostly individuals, who may not necessarily be a part of a formalised group, rather they act out the ideology of pacifism. A key reason for this was the continued support of the war effort as well as public support for the Fuhrer of Germany, Adolf Hitler remaining high throughout the war.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> This period was also when popular support for pacifism was at its lowest as there was significant support for the war effort. As Nazism was built on the outcome of the First World War, there was significant pro-war sentiment in the ideology as a means of resolving the issues which occurred after the war. This was in opposition to the pacifist ideology which was one reason for the Nazi response to Pacifist groups and individuals during the course of the Second World War.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" /> The atrocities of the Second World War also inspired the pacifist movement after the end of the war.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" />\n\n=== Cold War Germany (1945\u20131990) ===\nThe pacifist movement was at its most popular during the Cold War era. This is evident as a peace protest at Bonn occurred in 1981 which was a demonstration against the production of nuclear weapons and the militarism of the NATO alliance system. The reason for the popularity was the outcome of the First and Second World War, as the significant loss of lives shifted the culture towards militarism in Germany. Another key issue which was protested was the ability of the United States government to use West German weapons without consulting the West German government.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The event had approximately 300,000 people attend, which was a significant number for a pacifist event in West Germany, as it contrasts the historical size of the pacifist movements.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> This event was made up of 700 individual groups which protested together with the common link of the pacifist ideology. Another factor which influenced the size of the Bonn demonstration was the NATO plan to introduce intermediate-range theatre nuclear forces (INF) into Germany as a part of their military arsenal.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\">{{Cite journal|last=Boutwell|first=Jeffrey|date=Spring 1983|title=Politics and the Peace Movement in West Germany|journal=International Security|volume=7|issue=4|pages=72\u201392|doi=10.2307/2626732|jstor=2626732}}</ref> This debate was a prominent part of West German discourse during 1957 and 1958. The main concerns around the policy were the implications for domestic and international responsibilities as a nuclear state. The SPD initially opposed this proposition; however, they made a concession to introduce a military without nuclear capabilities. The following election the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats, which resulted in the SPD reforming their party and their ideology.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\" /> The part ideology after the reform, resembled Marxism as pacifism became an integral part of the party. Western Germany had a much greater presence of pacifists than Eastern Germany.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\" /> Christian-moral ethics were the driver of the movement, however, not all pacifists were Christian. While these Christian movements and groups have historically been the only consistent pacifists, this era saw the rise in pacifists not from the Christian faith. From the 1960\u2019s, there was a significant increase in student protests as part of the pacifist movement. Unions were also another group which became heavily involved in pacifism during this time. Even during its most popular stage, pacifism was not a characteristic of either political wing.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The policy of disarmament was also a heavily discussed policy at the time and the pacifist movement was advocating for the adoption of this policy.\n\n=== Contemporary Germany (1990\u2013Present) ===\nThe foreign policy of Contemporary Germany has been more pacifist than those of the previous historical eras. This is driven primarily by the history of German during the First and Second World Wars, as there was a significant loss of lives as a result of the perception of pacifism by the wider population. The use of force rarely occurs unless there is a need for humanitarian intervention, which is derived from the United Nations principle of collective security.<ref name=\"Rathbun 2006\">{{Cite journal|last=Rathbun|first=Brian|date=2006|title=The Myth of German Pacifism|journal=German Politics and Society|volume=24|issue=2|pages=68\u201381|doi=10.3167/104503006780681885}}</ref> One example of the government use of pacifism is demonstrated in their response to the United States\u2019 declaration of war on Iraq, as they were the first allied nation to condemn the decision and decide against participating in the war.<ref name=\"Rathbun 2006\" /> This damaged bi-lateral relations between the nations and was a significant moment for modern German foreign policy and its reliance on pacifism. There was no bi-partisan support for pacifism as it was primarily linked to the left-wing parties, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]]. The German government also abstained from participating in '''[[Kosovo War]]''' which was another war NATO participated in without German military support. After the [[Rwandan genocide|Rwandan Genocide]] and the [[Bosnian War]], the left-wing German parties allowed for military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons, while their right-wing counterparts believed in the strategic use of force for foreign policy. The NATO intervention during the later stages of the Yugoslavia Wars demonstrated this movement towards military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziemann|first=Benjamin|date=2015|title=German Pacifism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|journal=Neue Politische Literatur|volume=3|pages=415\u2013437|via=}}</ref> This was voted on by the two major left-wing parties the SPD and The Greens, who voted 75% and 50% in favour of the humanitarian intervention.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dalgaard-Nielsen|first=Anja|date=2005|title=The Test of Strategic Culture: Germany, Pacifism and Pre-emptive Strikes|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=36|issue=3|pages=339\u2013359|doi=10.1177/0967010605057020}}</ref> The use of pacifism has changed as the major German political parties\u2019 ideologies and positions change over time. During the 1990\u2019s there was limited agreement on whether the German government should oppose the use of force. However, from the early 2000s, the left-leaning parties have evolved to adopt policies of pacifism and an opposition to participating in the war. While the right-wing Christian-Democratic party has adopted a policy stating that Germany should be capable of defending itself through the use of military force.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> During this same era, Germany has consolidated its economic and political power over Europe, making the impact of their foreign policy significant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/opinion/bittner-rethinking-german-pacifism.html|title=Rethinking German Pacifism|last=Bittner|first=Jochen|date=4 November 2013|work=New York Times|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref> The non-intervention in the [[Syrian Civil War]] shows how despite humanitarian intervention allowing for military action, the German government is still unlikely to use military force. With the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] Russia has shown an aggressive use of military force in their conduct of foreign policy which provides the German Government with difficulties maintaining their pacifist ideology as the breach of human rights has had little impact on the Russian foreign policy, which is considered to be the result of Germany pacifism to some extent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/12/europeans-no-longer-fear-germany-but-do-the-germans-still-fear-themselves/|title=Europeans no longer fear Germany.

This was driven by the government as they attempted to use the media in order to promote the expansion of Germany as a growing empire.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\">{{Cite journal|last=Kuhn-Osius|first=Eckhard|date=2010|title=Germany's Lessons From the Lost \"Great War\": Pacifist Andreas Latzko and BellicistWalter Flex|journal=Peace Research|volume=42|pages=23\u201351}}</ref> The exception to this is during the Cold War with the Bonn demonstration with a large turnout of around 300,000 people.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\">{{Cite journal|last=Hoering|first=Uwe|date=March 1982|title=The Peace Movement in the Federal Republic of Germany|journal=Social Scientist|volume=10|issue=3|pages=56\u201363|doi=10.2307/3520251|jstor=3520251}}</ref> Christian peace groups have been the most consistent groups within the classification of pacifists as an opposition to violence is a key part of their faith. The size, whilst remaining small varies over the history of the Federal Republic of Germany. The reception from the public regarding pacifists also changes depending on the historical period.\n\n== Historical Periods ==\n\n=== Imperial Germany (1871\u20131914) ===\nWith the unification of Germany as a single state, the country began to expand militarily as an international power, which in turn created a pacifist movement in Germany. This first movement was called the [[German Peace Society]] and was founded in 1892. However, the movement was small with only 10,000 active members at its peak,<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> as it did not resonate with the wider population who was in favour of the German expansion.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\">{{Cite journal|last=Shand|first=James|date=1975|title=Doves among the Eagles: German Pacifists and Their Government during World War I|journal=Journal of Contemporary History|volume=10|pages=95\u2013108|doi=10.1177/002200947501000105}}</ref> With relatively low support the ability of the movement to grow was limited to the ability to speak freely which was later limited due to the government declaring a state of war. The rapid military expansion of Germany was also largely popular with the population. The movement, prior to the outbreak of war began to decline in support for the movement as the public support of a war grew and avoid a response from the government. During this time there were two Hague Peace Conferences, these conferences resulted in various multi-lateral treaties regarding military expansion and foreign policy.<ref name=\"Schlichtmann 2003\">{{Cite journal|last=Schlichtmann|first=Klaus|date=2003|title=Japan, Germany and the Idea of the Hague Peace Conferences|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=40|issue=4|pages=377\u2013394|doi=10.1177/00223433030404002}}</ref> The conference was also about establishing the universal values and therefore the obligations of states. In 1899 there was a Hauge Peace Conference, however, Germany did not attend, and it was not until the 1907 conference where Germany would participate. At this conference Germany was considered uncooperative, which was due to the restrictions on their ability to expand their military power.<ref name=\"Schlichtmann 2003\" /> Also, as Germany was a rising power there was a hesitation to reduce their expansion as it would restrict their self-defence capabilities.\n\n=== World War One Germany (1914\u20131918) ===\nGerman Pacifism was not as organised in this era when compared to that of Cold War Germany; however, a large number of groups adopted pacifist attitudes, which evolved throughout the war. During this period a group of female war opponents emerged, which was a pacifist group who were opposed to the war as it was, according to this group, caused by masculine values and attitudes. This group also overlapped with the group of advocates for women\u2019s\u2019 rights during the same period, as well as the socialist movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dollard|first=Catherine|date=2006|title=Martial Status and the Rhetoric of Women's Movement in World War I Germany|journal=Women in Germany Yearbook|volume=22|pages=211\u2013235|doi=10.1353/wgy.2006.0004}}</ref> This activism from female groups was the result of changing cultural, political and social roles of women which had developed during the war. Early in the war attitudes towards war were very positive, this along with the conscription of German soldiers resulted in the pacifists\u2019 movement remaining a relatively small group. As the country was in a state of war, the government was heavily involved in censorship of the population, so the pacifist publications were censored to not have views which directly opposed the government, rather they would be written in order to talk about the wider issue of war with other countries having the primary role at the beginning of war.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The government remained lenient towards those with pacifist attitudes which contrasts the government attitude of the Nazi Government and other governments which enacted the concept of total war on the home front. In 1915 at the Hague, the '''Women's Peace Conference''' met to discuss methods to end the war through negotiations. Attending this event was four German delegates. After this conference, the government began to restrict pacifists and their groups as there was a consensus that this conference had weakened the position of Germany for negotiations. Towards the end of the war, the public support massively declines, which resulted in an increase in the support for pacifist ideas, despite this the movement remained small in size. At this time the government tried to assert more control over the home front in order to provide more resources for soldiers on the front line. With the Russian Revolution, the pacifist movement also gained support and inspiration through the Marxist ideology behind the revolution.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> The literature during the war was restricted and the literature that was promoted all displayed similar views.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" /> These views support the war effort which was achieved through the justification of the war, as well as the celebration of acts of heroism and sacrifice. Pacifist literature was virtually non-existent during this time period which continued until the end of the war before it became more widely discussed in the literature.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" />\n\n=== World War Two Germany (1939\u20131945) ===\nThe existence of pacifists in Germany is at its lowest and least organised during this time, as a result of the Nazi Government\u2019s policies regarding movements which oppose their regime.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> Pacifists during this time are mostly individuals, who may not necessarily be a part of a formalised group, rather they act out the ideology of pacifism. A key reason for this was the continued support of the war effort as well as public support for the Fuhrer of Germany, Adolf Hitler remaining high throughout the war.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> This period was also when popular support for pacifism was at its lowest as there was significant support for the war effort. As Nazism was built on the outcome of the First World War, there was significant pro-war sentiment in the ideology as a means of resolving the issues which occurred after the war. This was in opposition to the pacifist ideology which was one reason for the Nazi response to Pacifist groups and individuals during the course of the Second World War.<ref name=\"Kuhn-Osius 2010\" /> The atrocities of the Second World War also inspired the pacifist movement after the end of the war.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" />\n\n=== Cold War Germany (1945\u20131990) ===\nThe pacifist movement was at its most popular during the Cold War era. This is evident as a peace protest at Bonn occurred in 1981 which was a demonstration against the production of nuclear weapons and the militarism of the NATO alliance system. The reason for the popularity was the outcome of the First and Second World War, as the significant loss of lives shifted the culture towards militarism in Germany. Another key issue which was protested was the ability of the United States government to use West German weapons without consulting the West German government.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The event had approximately 300,000 people attend, which was a significant number for a pacifist event in West Germany, as it contrasts the historical size of the pacifist movements.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> This event was made up of 700 individual groups which protested together with the common link of the pacifist ideology. Another factor which influenced the size of the Bonn demonstration was the NATO plan to introduce intermediate-range theatre nuclear forces (INF) into Germany as a part of their military arsenal.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\">{{Cite journal|last=Boutwell|first=Jeffrey|date=Spring 1983|title=Politics and the Peace Movement in West Germany|journal=International Security|volume=7|issue=4|pages=72\u201392|doi=10.2307/2626732|jstor=2626732}}</ref> This debate was a prominent part of West German discourse during 1957 and 1958. The main concerns around the policy were the implications for domestic and international responsibilities as a nuclear state. The SPD initially opposed this proposition; however, they made a concession to introduce a military without nuclear capabilities. The following election the SPD lost to the Christian Democrats, which resulted in the SPD reforming their party and their ideology.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\" /> The part ideology after the reform, resembled Marxism as pacifism became an integral part of the party. Western Germany had a much greater presence of pacifists than Eastern Germany.<ref name=\"Boutwell 1983\" /> Christian-moral ethics were the driver of the movement, however, not all pacifists were Christian. While these Christian movements and groups have historically been the only consistent pacifists, this era saw the rise in pacifists not from the Christian faith. From the 1960\u2019s, there was a significant increase in student protests as part of the pacifist movement. Unions were also another group which became heavily involved in pacifism during this time. Even during its most popular stage, pacifism was not a characteristic of either political wing.<ref name=\"Hoering 1982\" /> The policy of disarmament was also a heavily discussed policy at the time and the pacifist movement was advocating for the adoption of this policy.\n\n=== Contemporary Germany (1990\u2013Present) ===\nThe foreign policy of Contemporary Germany has been more pacifist than those of the previous historical eras. This is driven primarily by the history of German during the First and Second World Wars, as there was a significant loss of lives as a result of the perception of pacifism by the wider population. The use of force rarely occurs unless there is a need for humanitarian intervention, which is derived from the United Nations principle of collective security.<ref name=\"Rathbun 2006\">{{Cite journal|last=Rathbun|first=Brian|date=2006|title=The Myth of German Pacifism|journal=German Politics and Society|volume=24|issue=2|pages=68\u201381|doi=10.3167/104503006780681885}}</ref> One example of the government use of pacifism is demonstrated in their response to the United States\u2019 declaration of war on Iraq, as they were the first allied nation to condemn the decision and decide against participating in the war.<ref name=\"Rathbun 2006\" /> This damaged bi-lateral relations between the nations and was a significant moment for modern German foreign policy and its reliance on pacifism. There was no bi-partisan support for pacifism as it was primarily linked to the left-wing parties, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and [[Alliance 90/The Greens|The Greens]]. The German government also abstained from participating in '''[[Kosovo War]]''' which was another war NATO participated in without German military support. After the [[Rwandan genocide|Rwandan Genocide]] and the [[Bosnian War]], the left-wing German parties allowed for military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons, while their right-wing counterparts believed in the strategic use of force for foreign policy. The NATO intervention during the later stages of the Yugoslavia Wars demonstrated this movement towards military intervention on the basis of humanitarian reasons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziemann|first=Benjamin|date=2015|title=German Pacifism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|journal=Neue Politische Literatur|volume=3|pages=415\u2013437|via=}}</ref> This was voted on by the two major left-wing parties the SPD and The Greens, who voted 75% and 50% in favour of the humanitarian intervention.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dalgaard-Nielsen|first=Anja|date=2005|title=The Test of Strategic Culture: Germany, Pacifism and Pre-emptive Strikes|url=|journal=Security Dialogue|volume=36|issue=3|pages=339\u2013359|doi=10.1177/0967010605057020}}</ref> The use of pacifism has changed as the major German political parties\u2019 ideologies and positions change over time. During the 1990\u2019s there was limited agreement on whether the German government should oppose the use of force. However, from the early 2000's, the left-leaning parties have evolved to adopt policies of pacifism and an opposition to participating in the war. While the right-wing Christian-Democratic party has adopted a policy stating that Germany should be capable of defending itself through the use of military force.<ref name=\"Shand 1975\" /> During this same era, Germany has consolidated its economic and political power over Europe, making the impact of their foreign policy significant.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/opinion/bittner-rethinking-german-pacifism.html|title=Rethinking German Pacifism|last=Bittner|first=Jochen|date=4 November 2013|work=New York Times|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref> The non-intervention in the [[Syrian Civil War]] shows how despite humanitarian intervention allowing for military action, the German government is still unlikely to use military force. With the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Annexation of Crimea]] Russia has shown an aggressive use of military force in their conduct of foreign policy which provides the German Government with difficulties maintaining their pacifist ideology as the breach of human rights has had little impact on the Russian foreign policy, which is considered to be the result of Germany pacifism to some extent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/12/europeans-no-longer-fear-germany-but-do-the-germans-still-fear-themselves/|title=Europeans no longer fear Germany.

In Germany, Haribo was not an exclusive gourmet product, but a mass market candy. When Haribo of America was incorporated in the 1980s in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], Haribo's gummi candies were introduced to the US mass market through areas such as drugstores, grocery stores, and discount stores. The packaging was translated into English, and package weights were adjusted to match U.S. candy price points and package sizes. A laydown bag was developed for the US supermarket trade, instead of the hanging bag commonly found in German supermarkets, and a boxed product was developed for theaters. \n\nOnce this was done and Haribo products in US-style packaging were introduced at confectionery and fancy food shows, Haribo became a popular item.

The German advertisements were voiced by [[Thomas Gottschalk]] from 1991 until 2015. In English-speaking countries, it uses the slogan \"Kids and grown-ups love it so \u2013 the happy world of Haribo\". In [[Hungary]], it uses the slogan \"''Gyermek, feln\u0151tt kedve j\u00f3 \u2013 \u00e9des \u00e9let, Haribo''\" (\"Child and adult is happy \u2013 sweet life, Haribo\"). \"''Haribo c'est beau la vie, pour les grands et les petits''\" (\"Haribo life is beautiful, for big ones and little ones\") is used in [[France]], while in [[Italy]] the song used during commercials is: \"''Haribo \u00e8 la bont\u00e0, che si gusta ad ogni et\u00e0''\" (\"Haribo is the delicacy that one can taste at any age\").

In [[Hungary]], it uses the slogan \"''Gyermek, feln\u0151tt kedve j\u00f3 \u2013 \u00e9des \u00e9let, Haribo''\" (\"Child and adult is happy \u2013 sweet life, Haribo\"). \"''Haribo c'est beau la vie, pour les grands et les petits''\" (\"Haribo life is beautiful, for big ones and little ones\") is used in [[France]], while in [[Italy]] the song used during commercials is: \"''Haribo \u00e8 la bont\u00e0, che si gusta ad ogni et\u00e0''\" (\"Haribo is the delicacy that one can taste at any age\"). Similar slogans are used in other languages. The famed Haribo jingle music was created by UK composer Stephen Lee Vickers.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*Haribo is referred to by name in [[Watsky]]'s 2012 song \"Gummy Bear Hundrednaire\" off his [[mix-tape]] ''Nothing Like the First Time''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bft9zX5VSWw</ref><ref>https://gwatsky.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-like-the-first-time</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Haribo}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.haribo.com}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Food and drink companies established in 1920]]\n[[Category:Candy]]\n[[Category:Food and drink companies of Germany]]\n[[Category:Brand name confectionery]]\n[[Category:German brands]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bonn]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Rhineland-Palatinate]]\n[[Category:Ahrweiler (district)]]\n[[Category:German confectionery]]\n[[Category:Gummi candies]]\n[[Category:1920 establishments in Germany]]\n[[category:German snack foods]]\n", "name_user": "72.213.157.141", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eIn popular culture:I am among)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haribo"}

He was a close friend of King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]] who appointed him to several offices during his reign. For instance, between 1395 and 1401, then from 1409 to 1414 he was the [[Voivode of Transylvania]] (now in Romania). Stibor styled himself \"Lord of the whole [[V\u00e1h|V\u00e1g]]\", referring to his properties along the 409-km-long river (in present-day Slovakia) where 15 of his 31 castles were situated.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:POL COA Ostoja \u015acibor.svg|thumb|left|[[Coat of Arms]] of Stibor of Stiboricz]]\n\nStibor descended from a Polish noble family of the [[Clan of Ostoja]] whose possessions were located around [[Bydgoszcz]] in [[Greater Poland]]; his father was Mo\u015bcic, [[Voivode]] of [[Gniewkowo]]. Stibor arrived in the Kingdom of Hungary during the reign of King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] who also inherited the title of [[King of Poland]] (1370\u20131382). Following the king's death (10 September 1382), the Dowager Queen [[Elisabeth of Bosnia|Elisabeth]], who governed the two kingdoms in the name of his daughters, made Stibor the governor of [[Kuyavia]] and [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] in Poland in 1383. Around this time, Stibor became the close friend of Margrave [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Brandenburg]] (the future king of Hungary, who later also became German Emperor), the fianc\u00e9 of Queen [[Mary of Hungary]], who had been living in the Hungarian court since 1379.\n\nHowever, Sigismund could only seize the government of Hungary once the queen and her mother were captured by some rebellious barons (25 July 1386). He then appointed Stibor to his Master of the Court. Following his coronation (31 March 1387), King Sigismund entrusted Stibor with the government of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (a province under the supremacy of the kings of Hungary at that time), because the Hungarian \"prelates and barons\" had persuaded him to promise that he would not employ foreigners in his household. Nevertheless, King Sigismund granted Stibor [[Beckov Castle|Beck\u00f3 Castle]] (1388) and [[Uhrovec|Ugr\u00f3c]] (1389) Castles (today ''Beckovsk\u00fd hrad'' and ''Uhrovec'', respectively, in what is now [[Slovakia]]).\n\n==King's advisor==\n[[File:Bran Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Bran Castle]] in Transylvania, ruled by Stibor of Stiboricz, commonly named as [[Dracula]]'s Castle]]\n\nStibor was granted the ''ius indigenatus'' (the right to hold offices) and became ''[[isp\u00e1n|head]]'' of the Counties [[Pozsony county|Pozsony]] (1389), [[Trencs\u00e9n (county)|Trencs\u00e9n]] and [[Nyitra county|Nyitra]] (1392). In 1390 he received castles and properties in [[Vigvar]], [[Torbag]] and Modor and in 1392 Stibor was granted the possession of land and castles of [[\u010cachtice|Csejte]], [[Hol\u00ed\u010d|Holics]] (today ''\u010cachtice'' and ''Hol\u00ed\u010d'' in [[Slovakia]]), [[Bran\u010d|Berencs]], [[Plaveck\u00fd Castle|Detrek\u0151]], [[Ostr\u00fd Kame\u0148 Castle|\u00c9lesk\u0151]], [[Dobr\u00e1 Voda, Trnava District|J\u00f3k\u0151]], [[Zavar]] and [[Korl\u00e1tka|Korl\u00e1tk\u0151]] respectively, in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Few years later he expanded his small empire with castles and properties in [[Dio\u015b]], [[Szomolya]], [[Szent Vid]], Suran, [[Maniga]], [[Baganya]], Zuk, [[Kreesztes]], [[Rarkov]], Bary, [[Koszonic]], [[Rakovitz]], [[Tatkolch]], [[Ratkolch]], [[Ilkaman]], and [[Devin Castle|D\u00e9v\u00e9ny]] in [[Nyitra County|Nyitra]] and [[Presburg]] counties. Altogether Stibor of Stiboricz was in possession of 31 castles and over 400 towns and villages which at the time was half of western Slovakia of today.\n\nIn 1395, a foreign delegate mentioned that Stibor and the Archbishop [[John Kanizsai]] of [[Esztergom]] were the king's most influential advisors.<ref name='M\u00e1lyus'>{{cite book | last = M\u00e1lyusz | first = Elem\u00e9r | title = Zsigmond kir\u00e1ly uralma Magyarorsz\u00e1gon ''(King Sigismund's reign in Hungary)'' | publisher = Gondolat | year = 1984 | location = | page = 29 | isbn = 963-281-414-2}}</ref> King Sigismund's decree, issued in October 1397 upon the request of the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] assembled in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temesv\u00e1r]] (today ''Timi\u0219oara'' in [[Romania]]), prohibited the employment of foreigners in the royal administration, but Stibor, mentioned by name, was one of the few foreigners the decree was not to be applied.<ref>Article XLVIII of 1396</ref>\n\nHowever, Stibor assisted his relatives to acquire offices and possessions in Hungary, which produced envy amongst the king's other followers. When Stibor had left for [[Brzeg]] to follow the King's fianc\u00e9e, Margarete to Hungary, his opponents, led by the Archbishop John Kanizsai and the Palatine Derek Bebek, demanded that the king should dismiss his foreign advisors and especially Stibor and his family of the Clan of Ostoja. When the King refused to comply with their demands, they brought him into captivity and deprived Stibor of his offices (28 April 1401). But Stibor and the Clan, returned with their army to, together with [[Nicholas II Garai]], renounce the possession of most of castles and finally, the members of the Royal Council set the King free on 29 October 1401. Stibor remained the Emperors major adviser and he could maintain his possessions, as well. Shortly afterward, Stibor led the negotiations with the Teutonic Knights who bought the Neumark (in the Margraviate of Brandenburg) from Sigismund on 25 July 1402.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\">Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela : Rytier a jeho kr\u00e1\u013e.

Again, with the support of Nicholas II Garai and his army that defeated rebels' troops in other part of the Kingdom. The parties made an agreement under which the rebels accepted the King's rule and they were granted a royal pardon on 29 October 1403. Shortly afterwards, the King appointed Stibor to the head of [[Nyitra county]] and entrusted him to govern the possessions of the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger|Diocese of Eger]] (1405). Stibor himself entrusted those possessions to close family and members of the Clan of Ostoja.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n[[File:Stibor seal.jpg|thumb|left|Seal of Stibor]]\n\nThe genius of Stibor of Stiboricz's diplomacy is shown in the work of Wenzel and on this ground, in that of Antoni Prochaska and Daniela Dvorakova. As Sigismund wished to sell [[Neumark]] (Brandenburg) in order to reinforce the economy, Stibor set up a plan to make [[Teutonic Knights]] to pay much higher price that expected, keeping in mind that they would not then be able to finance a bigger army against Poland. Neumark at this time was a troubled land as there was no order and the land was well known to have [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s terrorizing the population and making the land dangerous to visit. To buy Neumark was to buy problems, a fact of which the Teutonic Knights were very well aware. It is also the reason why they did not hurry to buy the property. On the other hand, Neumark would surround Poland and give the Teutonic Knights protection from being attacked from that side. A problem for the Teutonic Knights arose when they were notified that Stibor was to be in charge of selling Neumark to Poland for a much smaller amount of money. The price was low and not realistic to accept for King Sigismund. But it would be surely to be understood to put pressure on the Teutonic Knights to buy the property since they could not afford to be surrounded by Polish forces from the west.\n\nAgreement was made between Stibor and two powerful Lords in Poland to sell Neumark to Poland. The agreement states that if selling Neumark to Poland would fail, all the properties of those three Lords who signed the agreement would go to the Polish Crown as compensation for the loss. A loss such as that would be remarkably high keeping in mind that Stibor owned almost half of western Slovakia at the time of negotiations. As the Teutonic Knights were forced to buy the land, they also had to pay all the penalty for breaking the agreement with Polish Lords. It is noted in Teutonic books that Stibor was one of their top expenses at the time. The price of Neumark was not just three times higher than its value; the penalty that Stibor took from the Knights was astronomic. Added to this, the problems inside Neumark made it very costly for the Knights to organize the territory. This was the beginning of the end of the power of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nAfter losing the war in Grunwald year 1410, they had to pay an additional penalty to the Polish Crown to survive. It is significant that all those penalties that had been paid to the Polish Crown as compensation for losses in the Grunwald war, ended in Hungary and the treasury of King Sigismund on the basis of diplomatic work by Stibor of Stiboricz and Zawisza Czarny. In return, Poland gained [[Spi\u0161]] that was in the hands of Poland to the time of partition. However, the most significant and amazing information in the documents are about those two Lords that signed the agreement to sell Neumark to Poland. They were S\u0119dziwuj de Szubin, the Duke of Kalisz and Mostko de Staszow, Lord Castellan of Poznan.\n\nThe first one was father of Stibor's wife and the second was of Clan of Ostoja family . There are no sources that can confirm that the penalty was ever paid to the Polish Crown, in fact there is no information at all about the agreement in the documents that consider the Crown.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=12158&from=publication& |title=Kujawsko-Pomorska Biblioteka Cyfrowa - \u015acibor ze \u015aciborzyc |publisher=Kpbc.umk.pl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref><ref>Pauly, M. and F.

It is also possible that [[Zawisza Czarny]] also was a relative to the Clan and the fact that he spent much time visiting many castles of the Clan during many years also show a close connection between this famous Black Knight (named so because of wearing black armor) and the Ostoja. Another interesting fact is that King [[Jogaila]] was also a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], the most powerful association of Kings, Dukes, and mighty Knights in Europe at that time. It was a secret society and there was never any member list done at the time. However, all members of this Order formed one political body against the enemy of Christianity (read [[Ottoman Empire]]). No member of the Order represented the Teutonic Knights. Secret meetings and agreements between Hungary and Poland and so between the Sigismund and Jogaila, using their most trusted couriers, question wherever there was ever any serious dispute between both ruling Kings. Declaring war against Poland in 1410 was more of a show in order to gain economic advantage from Teutonic Knights, than a real war. The facts remain, Teutonic Knights paid a considerable amount to Sigismund for declaring and attacking Poland from south. The outcome was small piece of land burned down to show the Teutonic Knights some action. The penalty paid by the Teutonic side after losing the Battle of Grunwald was much bigger and was transferred as a loan to Sigismund. All together, the diplomatic game showed on paper that Poland and Hungary were enemies, but in reality they were close friends.<ref>P. Engel, Zsigmond b\u00e1r\u00f3i (The barons of Sigismund), in E. Marosi et al</ref>\n\nIn the end, it was the Clan of Ostoja that was the leading force in breaking down the Teutonic side, they did it not only by using the fine art of the sword but also with outstanding diplomatic skills.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref>Antoni Eckstein \"Dzieje Ponieca do po\u0142owy XVI wieku\". Roczniki Historyczne nr 2 1926 r.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Lazar and the Richman.jpg|thumb|In the name of charity of Stibor's]]\n\nIn 1407, he fought in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. Stibor was among the first members of the [[Order of the Dragon]] founded by King Sigismund and his Queen [[Barbara of Celje]] (1408). In 1409, he was appointed again to the office of the Voivode of [[Transylvania]] and he also became the head of Trencs\u00e9n county.\n\nIn 1409, Sigismund signed a treaty with Teutonic Knights which was seen as direct action against Poland and in 1410, Scibor was in charge of the negotiations between Poland and Teutonic Knights on the behalf of Sigismund where Polish side was asked to not attack the Teutonic side. On behalf of Sigismund, Stibor sold Neumark to the Teutonic Knights for a remarkably large sum. This reinforced Sigismund's finances and made it more difficult for the Teutonic Knights to hire mercenaries to fight on their side against the Poles-Lithuanians in [[Battle of Grunwald|Grunwald]]-Tannenberg.\n\nIn May 1410, King Sigismund entrusted Stibor and the Palatine Nicholas II Garai to mediate between the Teutonic Knights and King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II of Poland, but when negotiations failed, war broke out. The [[Battle of Grunwald]] took place, with almost all of the Ostojas leaving Hungary to join Polish forces. However, Stibor and his brother Andrzej (Andrew) together with their sons, remained loyal to the Emperor. Instead, Stibor led small the Hungarian army<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Bogyay, Thomas von. \"Drachenorden.\" In: Lexikon des Mittelalters 3. Munich, 1986</ref> to attack Poland from the South. Because of the diplomatic work of Stibor of Stiboricz, Sigismund abandoned hostile actions against Poland and turned to support the wealthy and mighty [[Teutonic Knights]] by signing never executed agreements in to order to gain financial benefit to protect his own Empire for the Ottoman threat.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/> Leading King's army against Poland was mostly marking the support to the Teutonic Knights rather to do any serious damage. Few places have been burned down but Stibor's army did not siege of any stronghold, which Stibor easily could do leading elite army forces and well equipped. After burning down the land of [[Stary S\u0105cz]], Stibor's army turned back to Hungary in order to prepare the peace negotiations between Poland and Hungary.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In several Polish sources, there is a legend noted that small Polish army chased the army of Stibor and defeated him in small battle. Having in mind that Stibor of Stiboricz and his army, defeated several Principalities and burned down entire Austria except [[Vienna]], being victorious general in almost all the battles including against at the time powerful [[Venetian Empire]], those rumors have no scientific relevance, they are rather falsification of the history in order to glorify Polish victory over Teutonic Knights.\n\nStibor's own army included 1,000 well equipped Knights compared to King Sigismund's army of 3,000 Knights, he also was in command of entire army in Transylvania and, as he was one of the richest Lords of the Hungarian empire he could also afford to hire mercenaries if needed.\n\nAt the end of 1411, Stibor, his brothers and other members of the Clan of Ostoja were in charge of leading troops to fight against the Republic of Venetia in [[Friuli]]. In 1412, Stibor was meeting with [[Zawisza Czarny]] (The Black Knight) in his Castle of [[Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a]] in Slovakia, preparing the negotiation between Sigismund and Polish King Vladislav Jogaila, which ended with the [[Treaty of Lubowla]].<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/>\n\nBefore his death, he set up a [[chapter (religion)|collegiate chapter]] for [[Augustinians]] in [[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom|V\u00e1g\u00fajhely]] (today ''Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom'' in Slovakia).\n\n==Family==\nWith his wife, Dobrohna St\u0119szewska, he had a son, also named Stibor ([[Stibor de Beckov]]), who inherited his land and castles, and added to them with additional properties in [[Moravia]] and [[Germany]]. They also had a daughter, Rachna, who married the Polish Lord Andrew Ossoli\u0144ski. The sister of Stibor of Stiboricz had a son that become King of [[Bosnia]] during the time of [[Matthias Corvinus]].\n\nStibor of Stiboricz's two brothers, Andrew and Nicholas, and their sons, also held high offices, land and castles in the northern region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], as well as lesser holdings in Poland. Son of Nicholas, Nicholas Szarlejski was one of the most powerful and wealthy Lords in Poland, leading the Polish army in [[Prussia]].\n\nThe majority of the [[Clan of Ostoja]] lived in Poland.

He was a close friend of King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]] who appointed him to several offices during his reign. For instance, between 1395 and 1401, then from 1409 to 1414 he was the [[Voivode of Transylvania]] (now in Romania). Stibor styled himself \"Lord of the whole [[V\u00e1h|V\u00e1g]]\", referring to his properties along the 409-km-long river (in present-day Slovakia) where 15 of his 31 castles were situated.\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:POL COA Ostoja \u015acibor.svg|thumb|left|[[Coat of Arms]] of Stibor of Stiboricz]]\n\nStibor descended from a Polish noble family of the [[Clan of Ostoja]] whose possessions were located around [[Bydgoszcz]] in [[Greater Poland]]; his father was Mo\u015bcic, [[Voivode]] of [[Gniewkowo]]. Stibor arrived in the Kingdom of Hungary during the reign of King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] who also inherited the title of [[King of Poland]] (1370\u20131382). Following the king's death (10 September 1382), the Dowager Queen [[Elisabeth of Bosnia|Elisabeth]], who governed the two kingdoms in the name of his daughters, made Stibor the governor of [[Kuyavia]] and [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] in Poland in 1383. Around this time, Stibor became the close friend of Margrave [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Brandenburg]] (the future king of Hungary, who later also became German Emperor), the fianc\u00e9 of Queen [[Mary of Hungary]], who had been living in the Hungarian court since 1379.\n\nHowever, Sigismund could only seize the government of Hungary once the queen and her mother were captured by some rebellious barons (25 July 1386). He then appointed Stibor to his Master of the Court. Following his coronation (31 March 1387), King Sigismund entrusted Stibor with the government of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] (a province under the supremacy of the kings of Hungary at that time), because the Hungarian \"prelates and barons\" had persuaded him to promise that he would not employ foreigners in his household. Nevertheless, King Sigismund granted Stibor [[Beckov Castle|Beck\u00f3 Castle]] (1388) and [[Uhrovec|Ugr\u00f3c]] (1389) Castles (today ''Beckovsk\u00fd hrad'' and ''Uhrovec'', respectively, in what is now [[Slovakia]]).\n\n==King's advisor==\n[[File:Bran Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Bran Castle]] in Transylvania, ruled by Stibor of Stiboricz, commonly named as [[Dracula]]'s Castle]]\n\nStibor was granted the ''ius indigenatus'' (the right to hold offices) and became ''[[isp\u00e1n|head]]'' of the Counties [[Pozsony county|Pozsony]] (1389), [[Trencs\u00e9n (county)|Trencs\u00e9n]] and [[Nyitra county|Nyitra]] (1392). In 1390 he received castles and properties in [[Vigvar]], [[Torbag]] and Modor and in 1392 Stibor was granted the possession of land and castles of [[\u010cachtice|Csejte]], [[Hol\u00ed\u010d|Holics]] (today ''\u010cachtice'' and ''Hol\u00ed\u010d'' in [[Slovakia]]), [[Bran\u010d|Berencs]], [[Plaveck\u00fd Castle|Detrek\u0151]], [[Ostr\u00fd Kame\u0148 Castle|\u00c9lesk\u0151]], [[Dobr\u00e1 Voda, Trnava District|J\u00f3k\u0151]], [[Zavar]] and [[Korl\u00e1tka|Korl\u00e1tk\u0151]] respectively, in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Few years later he expanded his small empire with castles and properties in [[Dio\u015b]], [[Szomolya]], [[Szent Vid]], Suran, [[Maniga]], [[Baganya]], Zuk, [[Kreesztes]], [[Rarkov]], Bary, [[Koszonic]], [[Rakovitz]], [[Tatkolch]], [[Ratkolch]], [[Ilkaman]], and [[Devin Castle|D\u00e9v\u00e9ny]] in [[Nyitra County|Nyitra]] and [[Presburg]] counties. Altogether Stibor of Stiboricz was in possession of 31 castles and over 400 towns and villages which at the time was half of western Slovakia of today.\n\nIn 1395, a foreign delegate mentioned that Stibor and the Archbishop [[John Kanizsai]] of [[Esztergom]] were the king's most influential advisors.<ref name='M\u00e1lyus'>{{cite book | last = M\u00e1lyusz | first = Elem\u00e9r | title = Zsigmond kir\u00e1ly uralma Magyarorsz\u00e1gon ''(King Sigismund's reign in Hungary)'' | publisher = Gondolat | year = 1984 | location = | page = 29 | isbn = 963-281-414-2}}</ref> King Sigismund's decree, issued in October 1397 upon the request of the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] assembled in [[Timi\u015foara|Temesv\u00e1r]] (today ''Timi\u015foara'' in [[Romania]]), prohibited the employment of foreigners in the royal administration, but Stibor, mentioned by name, was one of the few foreigners the decree was not to be applied.<ref>Article XLVIII of 1396</ref>\n\nHowever, Stibor assisted his relatives to acquire offices and possessions in Hungary, which produced envy amongst the king's other followers. When Stibor had left for [[Brzeg]] to follow the King's fianc\u00e9e, Margarete to Hungary, his opponents, led by the Archbishop John Kanizsai and the Palatine Derek Bebek, demanded that the king should dismiss his foreign advisors and especially Stibor and his family of the Clan of Ostoja. When the King refused to comply with their demands, they brought him into captivity and deprived Stibor of his offices (28 April 1401). But Stibor and the Clan, returned with their army to, together with [[Nicholas II Garai]], renounce the possession of most of castles and finally, the members of the Royal Council set the King free on 29 October 1401. Stibor remained the Emperors major adviser and he could maintain his possessions, as well. Shortly afterward, Stibor led the negotiations with the Teutonic Knights who bought the Neumark (in the Margraviate of Brandenburg) from Sigismund on 25 July 1402.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\">Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela : Rytier a jeho kr\u00e1\u013e.

Again, with the support of Nicholas II Garai and his army that defeated rebels' troops in other part of the Kingdom. The parties made an agreement under which the rebels accepted the King's rule and they were granted a royal pardon on 29 October 1403. Shortly afterwards, the King appointed Stibor to the head of [[Nyitra county]] and entrusted him to govern the possessions of the [[Archdiocese of Esztergom]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Eger|Diocese of Eger]] (1405). Stibor himself entrusted those possessions to close family and members of the Clan of Ostoja.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n[[File:Stibor seal.jpg|thumb|left|Seal of Stibor]]\n\nThe genius of Stibor of Stiboricz's diplomacy is shown in the work of Wenzel and on this ground, in that of Antoni Prochaska and Daniela Dvorakova. As Sigismund wished to sell [[Neumark]] (Brandenburg) in order to reinforce the economy, Stibor set up a plan to make [[Teutonic Knights]] to pay much higher price that expected, keeping in mind that they would not then be able to finance a bigger army against Poland. Neumark at this time was a troubled land as there was no order and the land was well known to have [[Robber baron (feudalism)|robber baron]]s terrorizing the population and making the land dangerous to visit. To buy Neumark was to buy problems, a fact of which the Teutonic Knights were very well aware. It is also the reason why they did not hurry to buy the property. On the other hand, Neumark would surround Poland and give the Teutonic Knights protection from being attacked from that side. A problem for the Teutonic Knights arose when they were notified that Stibor was to be in charge of selling Neumark to Poland for a much smaller amount of money. The price was low and not realistic to accept for King Sigismund. But it would be surely to be understood to put pressure on the Teutonic Knights to buy the property since they could not afford to be surrounded by Polish forces from the west.\n\nAgreement was made between Stibor and two powerful Lords in Poland to sell Neumark to Poland. The agreement states that if selling Neumark to Poland would fail, all the properties of those three Lords who signed the agreement would go to the Polish Crown as compensation for the loss. A loss such as that would be remarkably high keeping in mind that Stibor owned almost half of western Slovakia at the time of negotiations. As the Teutonic Knights were forced to buy the land, they also had to pay all the penalty for breaking the agreement with Polish Lords. It is noted in Teutonic books that Stibor was one of their top expenses at the time. The price of Neumark was not just three times higher than its value; the penalty that Stibor took from the Knights was astronomic. Added to this, the problems inside Neumark made it very costly for the Knights to organize the territory. This was the beginning of the end of the power of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nAfter losing the war in Grunwald year 1410, they had to pay an additional penalty to the Polish Crown to survive. It is significant that all those penalties that had been paid to the Polish Crown as compensation for losses in the Grunwald war, ended in Hungary and the treasury of King Sigismund on the basis of diplomatic work by Stibor of Stiboricz and Zawisza Czarny. In return, Poland gained [[Spi\u0161]] that was in the hands of Poland to the time of partition. However, the most significant and amazing information in the documents are about those two Lords that signed the agreement to sell Neumark to Poland. They were S\u0119dziwuj de Szubin, the Duke of Kalisz and Mostko de Staszow, Lord Castellan of Poznan.\n\nThe first one was father of Stibor's wife and the second was of Clan of Ostoja family . There are no sources that can confirm that the penalty was ever paid to the Polish Crown, in fact there is no information at all about the agreement in the documents that consider the Crown.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://kpbc.umk.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=12158&from=publication& |title=Kujawsko-Pomorska Biblioteka Cyfrowa - \u015acibor ze \u015aciborzyc |publisher=Kpbc.umk.pl |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref><ref>Pauly, M. and F.

It is also possible that [[Zawisza Czarny]] also was a relative to the Clan and the fact that he spent much time visiting many castles of the Clan during many years also show a close connection between this famous Black Knight (named so because of wearing black armor) and the Ostoja. Another interesting fact is that King [[Jogaila]] was also a member of the [[Order of the Dragon]], the most powerful association of Kings, Dukes, and mighty Knights in Europe at that time. It was a secret society and there was never any member list done at the time. However, all members of this Order formed one political body against the enemy of Christianity (read [[Ottoman Empire]]). No member of the Order represented the Teutonic Knights. Secret meetings and agreements between Hungary and Poland and so between the Sigismund and Jogaila, using their most trusted couriers, question wherever there was ever any serious dispute between both ruling Kings. Declaring war against Poland in 1410 was more of a show in order to gain economic advantage from Teutonic Knights, than a real war. The facts remain, Teutonic Knights paid a considerable amount to Sigismund for declaring and attacking Poland from south. The outcome was small piece of land burned down to show the Teutonic Knights some action. The penalty paid by the Teutonic side after losing the Battle of Grunwald was much bigger and was transferred as a loan to Sigismund. All together, the diplomatic game showed on paper that Poland and Hungary were enemies, but in reality they were close friends.<ref>P. Engel, Zsigmond b\u00e1r\u00f3i (The barons of Sigismund), in E. Marosi et al</ref>\n\nIn the end, it was the Clan of Ostoja that was the leading force in breaking down the Teutonic side, they did it not only by using the fine art of the sword but also with outstanding diplomatic skills.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/><ref>Antoni Eckstein \"Dzieje Ponieca do po\u0142owy XVI wieku\". Roczniki Historyczne nr 2 1926 r.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Lazar and the Richman.jpg|thumb|In the name of charity of Stibor's]]\n\nIn 1407, he fought in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. Stibor was among the first members of the [[Order of the Dragon]] founded by King Sigismund and his Queen [[Barbara of Celje]] (1408). In 1409, he was appointed again to the office of the Voivode of [[Transylvania]] and he also became the head of Trencs\u00e9n county.\n\nIn 1409, Sigismund signed a treaty with Teutonic Knights which was seen as direct action against Poland and in 1410, Scibor was in charge of the negotiations between Poland and Teutonic Knights on the behalf of Sigismund where Polish side was asked to not attack the Teutonic side. On behalf of Sigismund, Stibor sold Neumark to the Teutonic Knights for a remarkably large sum. This reinforced Sigismund's finances and made it more difficult for the Teutonic Knights to hire mercenaries to fight on their side against the Poles-Lithuanians in [[Battle of Grunwald|Grunwald]]-Tannenberg.\n\nIn May 1410, King Sigismund entrusted Stibor and the Palatine Nicholas II Garai to mediate between the Teutonic Knights and King W\u0142adys\u0142aw II of Poland, but when negotiations failed, war broke out. The [[Battle of Grunwald]] took place, with almost all of the Ostojas leaving Hungary to join Polish forces. However, Stibor and his brother Andrzej (Andrew) together with their sons, remained loyal to the Emperor. Instead, Stibor led small the Hungarian army<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Bogyay, Thomas von. \"Drachenorden.\" In: Lexikon des Mittelalters 3. Munich, 1986</ref> to attack Poland from the South. Because of the diplomatic work of Stibor of Stiboricz, Sigismund abandoned hostile actions against Poland and turned to support the wealthy and mighty [[Teutonic Knights]] by signing never executed agreements in to order to gain financial benefit to protect his own Empire for the Ottoman threat.<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/> Leading King's army against Poland was mostly marking the support to the Teutonic Knights rather to do any serious damage. Few places have been burned down but Stibor's army did not siege of any stronghold, which Stibor easily could do leading elite army forces and well equipped. After burning down the land of [[Stary S\u0105cz]], Stibor's army turned back to Hungary in order to prepare the peace negotiations between Poland and Hungary.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In several Polish sources, there is a legend noted that small Polish army chased the army of Stibor and defeated him in small battle. Having in mind that Stibor of Stiboricz and his army, defeated several Principalities and burned down entire Austria except [[Vienna]], being victorious general in almost all the battles including against at the time powerful [[Venetian Empire]], those rumors have no scientific relevance, they are rather falsification of the history in order to glorify Polish victory over Teutonic Knights.\n\nStibor's own army included 1,000 well equipped Knights compared to King Sigismund's army of 3,000 Knights, he also was in command of entire army in Transylvania and, as he was one of the richest Lords of the Hungarian empire he could also afford to hire mercenaries if needed.\n\nAt the end of 1411, Stibor, his brothers and other members of the Clan of Ostoja were in charge of leading troops to fight against the Republic of Venetia in [[Friuli]]. In 1412, Stibor was meeting with [[Zawisza Czarny]] (The Black Knight) in his Castle of [[Star\u00e1 \u013dubov\u0148a]] in Slovakia, preparing the negotiation between Sigismund and Polish King Vladislav Jogaila, which ended with the [[Treaty of Lubowla]].<ref name=\"Dvo\u0159\u00e1kov\u00e1, Daniela 2003\"/>\n\nBefore his death, he set up a [[chapter (religion)|collegiate chapter]] for [[Augustinians]] in [[Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom|V\u00e1g\u00fajhely]] (today ''Nov\u00e9 Mesto nad V\u00e1hom'' in Slovakia).\n\n==Family==\nWith his wife, Dobrohna St\u0119szewska, he had a son, also named Stibor ([[Stibor de Beckov]]), who inherited his land and castles, and added to them with additional properties in [[Moravia]] and [[Germany]]. They also had a daughter, Rachna, who married the Polish Lord Andrew Ossoli\u0144ski. The sister of Stibor of Stiboricz had a son that become King of [[Bosnia]] during the time of [[Matthias Corvinus]].\n\nStibor of Stiboricz's two brothers, Andrew and Nicholas, and their sons, also held high offices, land and castles in the northern region of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], as well as lesser holdings in Poland. Son of Nicholas, Nicholas Szarlejski was one of the most powerful and wealthy Lords in Poland, leading the Polish army in [[Prussia]].\n\nThe majority of the [[Clan of Ostoja]] lived in Poland. It is not established which lines of the Clan are blood related to Stibors in Hungary.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:90%;width:98%;margin-left:3em\"\n|-\n!

Located in this area are the Howitt Street Shopping Centre, the Wendouree Homemaker Centre and Stockland Wendouree, as well as fast-food restaurants, car dealerships, community and health-care facilities and a number of small office buildings.\n\n==Education==\nWendouree is home to [[Ballarat Grammar School]] in Forest Street and the Wendouree campus of [[Ballarat Secondary College]].  Wendouree also has four primary schools, Wendouree Primary, Forest Street Primary, Our Lady Help of Christians Parish Primary, and Yuille Park Community College.\n\nBallarat Grammar is an independent Kindergarten to Year 12 school affiliated with the Anglican Church of Australia. It was opened by Bishop Green on the current site at the corner of Howitt and Forest Streets in 1911 as a school only for boys. In 1973 the school amalgamated with the Queens Grammar School for girls in Ballarat Central, with the girls making the move to the larger Wendouree campus.\n\nBallarat Secondary College (Wendouree Campus) is located at the corner of Forest Street and Giot Drive, at the northern end of the suburb.

In 1993 the school agreed to amalgamate with Ballarat East Secondary College (originally High School) and Midlands Secondary College (originally Ballarat North Technical School) to form Ballarat Secondary College. The Wendouree campus, like that of Ballarat East, caters for years 7 to 10. Years 11 and 12 are accommodated at the Barkly Street, Ballarat Central, campus opened in 2000. It replaced the Midlands campus, which has since been demolished.\n\nWendouree Primary School (PS 1813) is located on Howitt Street opposite the Howitt Street shopping centre.\n\nForest Street Primary School (PS 4936) is located at the northern end of Forest Street near the secondary college. It opened in February 1966.\n\nOur Lady Help of Christians Parish Primary School is located on Gillies Street in the suburb's north-west. It was opened on 15 October 1961, with the foundation staff of Srs. Anne Gardan, Antoinette Russo, Paulinus Setford and Austin Connellan.\n\nWendouree West Primary School (State School No 4701) opened in 1957. The Victorian Government Gazette 815<ref>http://gazette.slv.vic.gov.au/images/1956/V/general/815.pdf</ref> dated 26 September 1956 records the first Primary School originally being constructed as a six classroom, concrete veneer, timber framed building that cost 21,300 pounds to construct. The builder was the local Ballarat building firm A. V. Jennings Constructions. In 1972 the school was given a State award for having the best maintained school grounds in Victoria, with extensive plantings of flower beds and native trees. In 1975 a library, art room and multi-function hall complex was built at the expense of the removal of many of the best native flower and rose beds. In 1977 the primary school population peaked at 437 children. This number decreased significantly with the establishment of the temporary Yuille Primary School to the north in 1981.  Wendouree West Primary was renamed Grevillea Park in the early 1990s.\n\nYuille Park Community College (PS 5520), located on Violet Grove in the west of the suburb, opened in brand new buildings in 2007 as the merger of Yuille Primary School and Grevillea Park Primary School.<ref>http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/a-new-beginning-for-school-community/463531.aspx</ref>  The Yuille Primary School buildings in McKenzie Drive are now used for running alternative education programs for disinterested students.\n\n== Healthcare and Community Services ==\nWithin Wendouree are a number of significant healthcare facilities. These include the Queen Elizabeth Village, an aged care complex next to Stockland Wendouree, in Gillies Street. It is a publicly owned service and part of the larger Queen Elizabeth Centres of the Ballarat Health Services.\nIn Howitt Street near Wendouree Primary School is the Kelaston aged care centre and the Vision Australia Centre. Another facility, Mulvra Aged Care, is a privately run centre in Dowling Street, opposite the Wendouree Sports Complex.\n\nAlong both Howitt and Gillies Streets are many medical practices, some offering specialist services, such as podiatry, paediatrics, pathology, and medical imagery. The Ballarat Day Procedure Centre is in Howitt Street near the intersection with Forest Street.\n\nWendouree Veterinary Practice is also in Howitt Street.\n\nChild care and pre-school centres in Wendouree are located in College Street; Forest Street, near the Forest Street Primary School; Dare Street, as part of Ballarat Grammar School; Howitt Street, opposite the Day Procedure Centre; Gillies Street, opposite Weeramar Park; Norman Street, next to Weeramar Park; and Hazel Road.\n\nAdjoining Yuille Park College is the Wendouree West Community House, a neighbourhood centre offering social opportunities, adult education courses, and programs specifically designed for children, for youth, for men and for women. The Wendouree Community Health Centre, located near the corner of Learmonth Road and Gillies Street, provides health information and counselling, as well as space for hire for local groups and events.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Wendouree railway station, Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Wendouree Railway Station]]\nWendouree is serviced by several bus routes:\nRoute 11 terminates at Wendouree Station.

Later coaching AFL teams Footscray, West Coast Eagles, Collingwood, and Carlton.<ref>http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Mick%2BMalthouse%2B-%2B40%2Byears%2Bon/110</ref>\n\nThe Wendouree Central Bowling Club is located across the railway line in the suburb of Lake Wendouree. The Webbcona Bowls Club is situated in Grevillea Road, in the north-east of Wendouree next to the Minerdome. Just to the north of these facilities is the Hollioake Park Sports Complex which includes the Ballarat Tennis Centre, Table Tennis Stadium and the Ken Kay Badminton Stadium.\n\nIn the south-east of Wendouree, near the Showgrounds, is the Wendouree Sports Complex. This complex incorporates the Wendouree Football Oval (C. E. Brown Reserve), two smaller ovals, outdoor tennis courts and the Wendouree Sports and Events Centre. The latter is the home of indoor netball in Wendouree.\n\nOther sports facilities include the Wendouree West Recreation Reserve off Holly Grove, which has a football oval / cricket pitch and a BMX track; the large Ring Road reserve; and a number of small reserves within residential areas.\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n===Wendouree West===\n\nThe Ballarat West Estate, later renamed as Wendouree West, was first planned in 1949 as a large public housing scheme of the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], to deal with the post-war housing shortage. Demand was also anticipated with the increasing 'baby boom' and intake of post-war immigrants. The estate originally consisted of 750 prefabricated timber bungalows that were mostly built between 1952 and 1962. Initially many of its residents worked in nearby manufacturing plants producing building laminate, caravans and roller bearings.\n\nWendouree West Post Office opened in February 1955. The post office was relocated to Wendouree Village Shopping Centre (now Stockland) in 1992.<ref name=\"PostOffice\"/>\n\nEarly plans envisaged the estate to be an urban planning model, however development of infrastructure was considerably slower than the construction of housing, with many homes not being connected to sewerage or served by sealed roads until the late 1950s. During the 1950s an aggressive and active community development committee was established, and elements of this committee still remain today, promoting the ongoing development of the neighbourhood. In the mid-1950s a small shopping centre, playgrounds, a kindergarten and other amenities were built. During the 1970s a further 500, more substantial modern brick veneer homes were built to the north of the estate. By the late 1970s the population of the suburb peaked at approximately 5,000.\n\nToday, the estate has a resident population representing a mixture of cultures and age groups. The estate is noted as having low socio-economic resources due to higher-than-average unemployment, a high population of aged residents, and inter-generational social welfare dependency.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/nothing-comes-easy-in-wendouree-west-20110827-1jftj.html Nothing comes easy in Wendouree west]</ref>\n\nAttempts over the years to change the name of Wendouree West were met with mixed responses from residents throughout Ballarat. In the early 2000s, during a process to make official the boundaries of all cities, towns and suburbs in Victoria, it was determined that Wendouree West would exist only as an unofficial neighbourhood name. The name Wendouree West (or \"Westie\") was often used to stigmatise and as a term of derision, often placing its residents at a disadvantage when applying for employment and other positions in the wider Ballarat community. In large part, this historic stigmatisation has contributed to the ongoing disadvantage of its youths. The estate today is now included as part of Wendouree.\n\nIn recent years attempts have been made to rejuvenate the estate including the removal of many of the early prefabricated cottages and the construction of retirement units and modern private and public housing. Some 300 of the original houses are to be retained and many have already undergone extensive renovation and modernisation, but in such a way that the historical character of the area remains intact. The original Wendouree West State School buildings were demolished in early 2007, with the new replacement school opening as Yuille Park Community College, the product of amalgamation with Yuille Primary School. The renewal program has also seen a lot of civic improvements including street-scaping, an upgrade of the shopping centre, new footpaths and fences, as well as new play equipment, toilets and barbecue facilities in the parks.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ballarat_suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Ballarat]]\n", "text_old": "{{morefootnotes|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox Australian place| type = suburb\n| name     = Wendouree\n| state    = vic\n| city = [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]]\n| image    = View west over Wendouree from the showgrounds.jpg\n| caption  = View west over Howitt Street from the exhibition grounds.\n| lga      = City of Ballarat\n| use_lga_map = yes\n| coordinates = {{coord|37.532|S|143.823|E|display=inline,title}}\n| postcode = 3355\n| est      = \n| pop      = 10445\n| pop_year = {{CensusAU|2016}}\n| pop_footnotes = <ref name=\"ABS\">{{Census 2016 AUS|id=SSC22731|name=Wendouree (State Suburb)|accessdate=27 June 2016|quick=on}}</ref>\n| area = 9.72\n| elevation= \n| maxtemp  = \n| mintemp  = \n| rainfall = \n| stategov = [[Electoral district of Wendouree|Wendouree]]\n| fedgov   = [[Division of Ballarat|Ballarat]]\n| dist1    = 5 | dir1=NW| location1 = [[Ballarat Central]]\n| near-nw  = [[Miners Rest, Victoria|Miners Rest]]\n| near-n   = [[Mount Rowan, Victoria|Mount Rowan]]\n| near-ne  = [[Invermay Park, Victoria|Invermay Park]]\n| near-w   = [[Mitchell Park, Victoria|Mitchell Park]]\n| near-e   = [[Ballarat North, Victoria|Ballarat North]]\n| near-sw  = [[Lake Gardens, Victoria|Lake Gardens]]\n| near-s   = [[Lake Wendouree, Victoria|Lake Wendouree]]\n| near-se  = [[Soldiers Hill, Victoria|Soldiers Hill]]\n}}\n\n'''Wendouree''' ({{IPAc-en|,|w|\u025b|n|d|\u0259|'|r|i:}}) is a large suburb on the north western [[rural-urban fringe]] of the city of [[Ballarat]], in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

Wendouree West Primary was renamed Grevillea Park in the early 1990s.\n\nYuille Park Community College (PS 5520), located on Violet Grove in the west of the suburb, opened in brand new buildings in 2007 as the merger of Yuille Primary School and Grevillea Park Primary School.<ref>http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/a-new-beginning-for-school-community/463531.aspx</ref>  The Yuille Primary School buildings in McKenzie Drive are now used for running alternative education programs for disinterested students.\n\n== Healthcare and Community Services ==\nWithin Wendouree are a number of significant healthcare facilities. These include the Queen Elizabeth Village, an aged care complex next to Stockland Wendouree, in Gillies Street. It is a publicly owned service and part of the larger Queen Elizabeth Centres of the Ballarat Health Services.\nIn Howitt Street near Wendouree Primary School is the Kelaston aged care centre and the Vision Australia Centre. Another facility, Mulvra Aged Care, is a privately run centre in Dowling Street, opposite the Wendouree Sports Complex.\n\nAlong both Howitt and Gillies Streets are many medical practices, some offering specialist services, such as podiatry, paediatrics, pathology, and medical imagery. The Ballarat Day Procedure Centre is in Howitt Street near the intersection with Forest Street.\n\nWendouree Veterinary Practice is also in Howitt Street.\n\nChild care and pre-school centres in Wendouree are located in College Street; Forest Street, near the Forest Street Primary School; Dare Street, as part of Ballarat Grammar School; Howitt Street, opposite the Day Procedure Centre; Gillies Street, opposite Weeramar Park; Norman Street, next to Weeramar Park; and Hazel Road.\n\nAdjoining Yuille Park College is the Wendouree West Community House, a neighbourhood centre offering social opportunities, adult education courses, and programs specifically designed for children, for youth, for men and for women. The Wendouree Community Health Centre, located near the corner of Learmonth Road and Gillies Street, provides health information and counselling, as well as space for hire for local groups and events.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Wendouree railway station, Victoria.jpg|thumb|right|Wendouree Railway Station]]\nWendouree is serviced by several bus routes:\nRoute 11 terminates at Wendouree Station. Ballarat Station to Wendouree Station via Drummond Street.\nRoute 12 terminates at Wendouree Station.

Wendouree Station to Miners Rest via Learmonth Road.\nRoute 10 stops at Wendouree Station. Ballarat Station to Alfredton via Wendouree and Midland Highway, Forest Street and Gillies Street.\nBallarat Taxis operates in Wendouree and throughout Ballarat and offers the only night transport in Wendouree excluding Night Trains and Coaches.<ref>http://www.cdcvictoria.com.au/images/pdf/ballarat/New_Ballarat_Network_Map.pdf</ref>\n[[Wendouree railway station]], opened in 2009, is located on the south-western edge of the suburb, just off Learmonth Road.\n\n== Sports Facilities ==\n[[File:Eureka Stadium.jpg|left|thumb|600px|Eureka Stadium at Ballarat Showgrounds in Wendouree]]\nWendouree has a number of sporting facilities including the Minerdome basketball stadium, home of the Ballarat Miners and Rush, Wendouree Oval, the Sports & Events Centre and Eureka Stadium, home of the [[North Ballarat Football Club]].\n\nAFL Player/Coach Mick Malthouse was raised in Wendouree West, where he played football, and later joined North Ballarat club, before going on to play for St Kilda and Richmond in the VFL/AFL. Later coaching AFL teams Footscray, West Coast Eagles, Collingwood, and Carlton.<ref>http://australianfootball.com/articles/view/Mick%2BMalthouse%2B-%2B40%2Byears%2Bon/110</ref>\n\nThe Wendouree Central Bowling Club is located across the railway line in the suburb of Lake Wendouree. The Webbcona Bowls Club is situated in Grevillea Road, in the north-east of Wendouree next to the Minerdome. Just to the north of these facilities is the Hollioake Park Sports Complex which includes the Ballarat Tennis Centre, Table Tennis Stadium and the Ken Kay Badminton Stadium.\n\nIn the south-east of Wendouree, near the Showgrounds, is the Wendouree Sports Complex. This complex incorporates the Wendouree Football Oval (C. E. Brown Reserve), two smaller ovals, outdoor tennis courts and the Wendouree Sports and Events Centre. The latter is the home of indoor netball in Wendouree.\n\nOther sports facilities include the Wendouree West Recreation Reserve off Holly Grove, which has a football oval / cricket pitch and a BMX track; the large Ring Road reserve; and a number of small reserves within residential areas.\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n===Wendouree West===\n\nThe Ballarat West Estate, later renamed as Wendouree West, was first planned in 1949 as a large public housing scheme of the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], to deal with the post-war housing shortage. Demand was also anticipated with the increasing 'baby boom' and intake of post-war immigrants. The estate originally consisted of 750 prefabricated timber bungalows that were mostly built between 1952 and 1962. Initially many of its residents worked in nearby manufacturing plants producing building laminate, caravans and roller bearings.\n\nWendouree West Post Office opened in February 1955. The post office was relocated to Wendouree Village Shopping Centre (now Stockland) in 1992.<ref name=\"PostOffice\"/>\n\nEarly plans envisaged the estate to be an urban planning model, however development of infrastructure was considerably slower than the construction of housing, with many homes not being connected to sewerage or served by sealed roads until the late 1950s. During the 1950s an aggressive and active community development committee was established, and elements of this committee still remain today, promoting the ongoing development of the neighbourhood. In the mid-1950s a small shopping centre, playgrounds, a kindergarten and other amenities were built. During the 1970s a further 500, more substantial modern brick veneer homes were built to the north of the estate. By the late 1970s the population of the suburb peaked at approximately 5,000.\n\nToday, the estate has a resident population representing a mixture of cultures and age groups. The estate is noted as having low socio-economic resources due to higher-than-average unemployment, a high population of aged residents, and inter-generational social welfare dependency.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/nothing-comes-easy-in-wendouree-west-20110827-1jftj.html Nothing comes easy in Wendouree west]</ref>\n\nAttempts over the years to change the name of Wendouree West were met with mixed responses from residents throughout Ballarat. In the early 2000s, during a process to make official the boundaries of all cities, towns and suburbs in Victoria, it was determined that Wendouree West would exist only as an unofficial neighbourhood name. The name Wendouree West (or \"Westie\") was often used to stigmatise and as a term of derision, often placing its residents at a disadvantage when applying for employment and other positions in the wider Ballarat community. In large part, this historic stigmatisation has contributed to the ongoing disadvantage of its youths. The estate today is now included as part of Wendouree.\n\nIn recent years attempts have been made to rejuvenate the estate including the removal of many of the early prefabricated cottages and the construction of retirement units and modern private and public housing. Some 300 of the original houses are to be retained and many have already undergone extensive renovation and modernisation, but in such a way that the historical character of the area remains intact. The original Wendouree West State School buildings were demolished in early 2007, with the new replacement school opening as Yuille Park Community College, the product of amalgamation with Yuille Primary School. The renewal program has also seen a lot of civic improvements including street-scaping, an upgrade of the shopping centre, new footpaths and fences, as well as new play equipment, toilets and barbecue facilities in the parks.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ballarat_suburbs}}\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Ballarat]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Anotoinette->Antoinette -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendouree,_Victoria"}
