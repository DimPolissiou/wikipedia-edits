In that era, Bangkok had only 871 tourist-standard rooms to serve its 40,000 foreign visitors per year. In 1959 the first governmental tourist authority was formed. In the early-1960s, [[Don Mueang Airport]] completed a runway that could accommodate jet aircraft. Bangkok then became one of the approved [[R&R (military)|R&R]] locations for US troops serving in Vietnam. Some 45,000 troops visited in 1967, while the number of full-time, Thailand-based US troops swelled to 45,000 in 1969. The number of Bangkok hotel rooms exploded to 7,000 by the mid-1960s. The US troop presence turned [[Phetchaburi Road|New Phetchaburi Road]] into an \"American strip\" of bars, massage parlours, brothels, and clubs. After the US quit Thailand in the 1970s, the sex industry was repackaged to accommodate a civilian clientele. By 1979, the number of annual foreign visitors had grown to more than 600,000, rising to 12 million annually by the turn of the 21st century.<ref name=\"Baker-2009\">{{cite book |last1=Baker |first1=Chris |last2=Phongpaichit |first2=Pasuk |title=A History of Thailand |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521759151 |edition=2nd, paper|pages=149, 204}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\n[[File:0005030-\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e41\u0e01\u0e49\u0e27\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22.jpg|thumb|left|Fireworks at [[Phra Nakhon Khiri Historical Park]], [[Phetchaburi Province|Phetchaburi]]]]\n[[File:Kinnon Wat Phra Kaew.jpeg|thumb|right|A mythical ''[[Kinnara|Kinnon]]'', [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Bangkok]]]]\n[[File:Wat Phra Sri Sanphet 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]], [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]]]]\n\nAmong the reasons for the increase in tourism in the 1960s were the stable political atmosphere and the development of Bangkok as a crossroads of international air transport.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Thailand Became a Tourist Hotspot during the 60\u2019s |url=https://www.thailand-business-news.com/tourism/70078-how-thailand-became-a-tourist-hotspot-during-the-60s.html |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Thailand Business News |date=2018-08-30 |format=Video}}</ref> The hotel industry and retail industry both expanded rapidly due to tourist demand.

Thailand closed the year with an overall hotel occupancy of 73.4%, an increase of 13.6% over 2014, as arrivals rose to near the 30 million mark, driven by demand from the Chinese market. December 2015 was a particularly strong month as occupancy levels reached 77.4%, the highest level since 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thailand\u2019s hotel occupancy hits 20-year high|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/67883/thailand-s-hotel-occupancy-hits-20-year-high|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=eTN Global Travel Industry News|date=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nDespite the increasing number of tourist arrivals, some businesses catering to the tourist trade report declining numbers. Mr Sompoch Sukkaew, chief legal counsel of the Patong Entertainment Business Association (PEBA) in Phuket, said in January 2016 that entertainment businesses are suffering. \"Over the past three years, most bars were averaging about B90,000 revenue per day at this time of year,...now they're making just B40,000. Small bars...used to average B40,000 to B50,000 a day, now they're down to just B10,000 per day....PEBA members generated about B1.5 million per day during the peak season. Now it's down to about B540,000 per day.\" PEBA members number 500 in Patong, with about 200 businesses in the Bangla Road entertainment area. PEBA President Weerawit Kuresombat attributed the decline to the rise in Chinese tourism. \"...most of them [Chinese tourists] come on complete tour packages....This means they spend very little on extras....They rarely venture out for the nightlife or even visit independent restaurants. They just don't spend much\", he said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sakoot|first1=Tanyaluk|title=Going Down: Businesses on Phuket\u2019s famed Bangla Rd suffer as clientele dries up|url=http://www.thephuketnews.com/going-down-businesses-on-phuket-famed-bangla-rd-suffer-as-clientele-dries-up-55868.php|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=Phuket News|date=2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Thai government expects revenue from foreign tourists to increase by 8.5% to 1.78 trillion baht (US$49.8 billion) in 2017. Deputy Prime Minister Thanasak Patimaprakorn attributed the increase to the improving outlook for global tourism as well as Thailand's investments in infrastructure.

In the five years after the logging ban, tourism in Thailand rose by 28%. [[Elephant]]s came back into demand and those with low economic value were placed into camps. The tourism boom gave elephants a place to work and be cared for. It increased their economic value. Today there are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 domesticated elephants left in [[Thailand]].<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" />\n\n;Welfare\n[[File:Elephant in Kui Buri national park (18979510630).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Asian elephant]], ''Elephas maximus'' is the national animal of Thailand]]\nAmong [[animal rights]] groups there has been a growing concern over elephant welfare.  Elephants in [[Thailand]] have fewer health problems than those in circuses, but often their health is not robust. Overall their [[welfare]] and treatment depends on how much money their [[mahout]]s make. Elephants in larger camps have been observed in better health that those in smaller camps. Baby elephants are highly valued as they are very popular among tourists.<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" /> Many mahouts thus mate their female elephants. Unfortunately, natural insemination and birthing is time-consuming and expensive. An easy way around this is the illegal capture of baby elephants from wild herds. To be able to take a baby elephant from the herd, its mother needs to be killed as she will try to protect the infant. Baby elephants are then placed in artificial herds to please tourists. Elephants in these herds are often all from different provinces.<ref name=\"Chatkupt-1999\" />\n\n[[Elephant]]s can sustain injuries related to giving rides, or going on treks, with tourists. The elephant's spine is curved and not optimised to carry heavy loads. When tourists ride two at a time they can weigh over that amount. The chairs or benches often used for the tourists to sit on upon the elephant can cause abrasions and chafing on the elephant's back, sides, and torso. During treks mahouts control the elephants with hooks and can use excessive force, resulting in puncture wounds.<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" />\n\n;Laws\nThe law pertaining to domesticated elephants is the ''Beast of Burden Act 2482 B.E.''

In that era, Bangkok had only 871 tourist-standard rooms to serve its 40,000 foreign visitors per year. In 1959 the first governmental tourist authority was formed. In the early-1960s, [[Don Mueang Airport]] completed a runway that could accommodate jet aircraft. Bangkok then became one of the approved [[R&R (military)|R&R]] locations for US troops serving in Vietnam. Some 45,000 troops visited in 1967, while the number of full-time, Thailand-based US troops swelled to 45,000 in 1969. The number of Bangkok hotel rooms exploded to 7,000 by the mid-1960s.

Thailand closed the year with an overall hotel occupancy of 73.4%, an increase of 13.6% over 2014, as arrivals rose to near the 30 million mark, driven by demand from the Chinese market. December 2015 was a particularly strong month as occupancy levels reached 77.4%, the highest level since 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thailand\u2019s hotel occupancy hits 20-year high|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/67883/thailand-s-hotel-occupancy-hits-20-year-high|accessdate=26 January 2016|work=eTN Global Travel Industry News|date=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nDespite the increasing number of tourist arrivals, some businesses catering to the tourist trade report declining numbers. Mr Sompoch Sukkaew, chief legal counsel of the Patong Entertainment Business Association (PEBA) in Phuket, said in January 2016 that entertainment businesses are suffering. \"Over the past three years, most bars were averaging about B90,000 revenue per day at this time of year,...now they're making just B40,000. Small bars...used to average B40,000 to B50,000 a day, now they're down to just B10,000 per day....PEBA members generated about B1.5 million per day during the peak season. Now it's down to about B540,000 per day.\" PEBA members number 500 in Patong, with about 200 businesses in the Bangla Road entertainment area. PEBA President Weerawit Kuresombat attributed the decline to the rise in Chinese tourism. \"...most of them [Chinese tourists] come on complete tour packages....This means they spend very little on extras....They rarely venture out for the nightlife or even visit independent restaurants. They just don't spend much\", he said.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sakoot|first1=Tanyaluk|title=Going Down: Businesses on Phuket\u2019s famed Bangla Rd suffer as clientele dries up|url=http://www.thephuketnews.com/going-down-businesses-on-phuket-famed-bangla-rd-suffer-as-clientele-dries-up-55868.php|accessdate=27 January 2016|work=Phuket News|date=2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Thai government expects revenue from foreign tourists to increase by 8.5% to 1.78 trillion baht (US$49.8 billion) in 2017.

In the five years after the logging ban, tourism in Thailand rose by 28%. [[Elephant]]s came back into demand and those with low economic value were placed into camps. The tourism boom gave elephants a place to work and be cared for. It increased their economic value. Today there are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 domesticated elephants left in [[Thailand]].<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" />\n\n;Welfare\n[[File:Elephant in Kui Buri national park (18979510630).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Asian elephant]], ''Elephas maximus'' is the national animal of Thailand]]\nAmong [[animal rights]] groups there has been a growing concern over elephant welfare.  Elephants in [[Thailand]] have fewer health problems than those in circuses, but often their health is not robust. Overall their [[welfare]] and treatment depends on how much money their [[mahout]]s make. Elephants in larger camps have been observed in better health that those in smaller camps. Baby elephants are highly valued as they are very popular among tourists.<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" /> Many mahouts thus mate their female elephants. Unfortunately, natural insemination and birthing is time-consuming and expensive. An easy way around this is the illegal capture of baby elephants from wild herds. To be able to take a baby elephant from the herd, its mother needs to be killed as she will try to protect the infant. Baby elephants are then placed in artificial herds to please tourists. Elephants in these herds are often all from different provinces.<ref name=\"Chatkupt-1999\" />\n\n[[Elephant]]s can sustain injuries related to giving rides, or going on treks, with tourists. The elephant's spine is curved and not optimised to carry heavy loads. When tourists ride two at a time they can weigh over that amount. The chairs or benches often used for the tourists to sit on upon the elephant can cause abrasions and chafing on the elephant's back, sides, and torso. During treks mahouts control the elephants with hooks and can use excessive force, resulting in puncture wounds.<ref name=\"Kontogeorgopoulos, 2009\" />\n\n;Laws\nThe law pertaining to domesticated elephants is the ''Beast of Burden Act 2482 B.E.''

{"title_page": "Stasis (fiction)", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=February 2015}}\n{{one source|date=February 2015}}\n{{original research|date=February 2015}}\n{{weasel|date=February 2015}}\n}}\nA '''stasis''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|e\u026a|s|\u026a|s}} or '''stasis field''', in [[science fiction]], is a confined area of space in which time has been stopped or the contents have been rendered motionless.\n\n==Overview==\nA stasis field is imagined to be a region in which a stasis process is in effect. Stasis fields in fictional settings often have several common characteristics. These include infinite or nearly infinite rigidity, making them \"unbreakable objects\" and a perfect or nearly-perfect reflective surface. Most science fiction plots rely on a physical device to establish this region. When the device is deactivated, the stasis field collapses, and the stasis effect ends.\n\nTime is often suspended in stasis fields. Such fields thus have the additional property of protecting non-living materials from deterioration. This [[time dilation]] can be, from an in-universe perspective, absolute;  something thrown into the field, has the field triggered and then reactivated, would fly out as if nothing had happened. Storylines using such fields often have materials as well as living beings surviving thousands or millions of years beyond their normal lifetimes. The property also allows for such [[plot device]]s as [[booby trap]]s, containing, for instance, a [[nuclear bomb]].<ref name=\"Forever War\">{{cite book| last=Haldeman| first=Joe| title=[[The Forever War]]| year=1975| publisher=Eos (HarperCollins)| isbn=0-380-70821-3}}</ref> Once out of the stasis field, the trap is sprung. In such a situation, to avoid the protagonist from seeing what is in the field, the story line would not allow normal beings to see something protected by a stasis field.\n\nOne use of stasis fields is as a form of [[suspended animation in fiction|suspended animation]]: to let passengers and cargoes (normally of spacecraft or [[sleeper ship|sleeper ships]]) avoid having to experience extremely long periods of time by \"skipping over\" large sections of it. They may also be used, such as in ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'', as protection against the effects of extreme acceleration.\n\nThere are real phenomena that cause time dilation similar that of a stasis field. Extremely high velocities approaching [[light speed]] or immensely powerful [[gravitational field| gravitational fields]] such as those existing near the event horizons of black holes will cause time to progress more slowly. However, there is no known theoretical way of causing such time dilation independently of such conditions.\n\n==Examples==\nThe noted science fiction author [[Larry Niven]] used the concept of stasis fields and stasis boxes to a great extent directly or indirectly throughout his many novels and short stories set in the [[Known Space]] series. Niven's stasis fields followed conductive surfaces when established, and the resulting frozen space became a completely invulnerable and perfectly reflective object. They were often used as emergency protective devices. They could also be used to create a weapon called a variable sword, a length of extremely fine wire in a stasis field that makes it able to easily cut through normal matter. For more information, see [[Slaver stasis field]].\n\nA more limited form of stasis field is the \"bobble\", found in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s [[Peace Authority]] setting. A bobble is always perfectly spherical and exists for a fixed period of time that is set when the bobble is first created. The duration of a bobble effect cannot be changed. Bobble generators were initially used as weapons, removing their targets from the field of combat.\n\nAnother example of a stasis field exists in [[Joe Haldeman]]'s ''[[The Forever War]]'',<ref name=\"Forever War\"/> where stasis field generators are carried by troops to create conditions where melee weapons become the only viable means of combat. Inside the field, no object can travel faster than 16.3&nbsp;m/s, which includes electrons, photons, and the field itself. Soldiers inside the field must be wearing suits with a special coating, or all electrical activity within their body would stop and the soldiers would die. In the novel, the main character defeats an enemy army, which has besieged a small remaining contingent of human troops on a moon, by arming a nuclear bomb inside the field and then moving the field away from the bomb. Once the bomb is revealed, its electrical activity resumes, and it promptly detonates. That vaporises the surrounding army, and a large chunk of the ground beneath the field. The soldiers emerge some days later to see if their trick worked and find themselves alone at the bottom of a large crater, their enemy destroyed.\n\nIn Peter F. Hamilton's [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy|''The Night\u2019s Dawn'' trilogy]] (1996-1999), \u201czero-tau pods\u201d \u2014 powered containers inside which time halts \u2014 are an important narrative device.\n\nIn the computer strategy game ''[[StarCraft]]'', the Arbiter unit can, through a combination of Protoss technology and the Arbiter's psionic power, create a stasis field that traps all units in the affected area in blue \"crystals\" of stopped time, taking them out of the fight and rendering them invulnerable for 30 seconds, thus allowing both offensive and defensive applications.\n\nThe ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'' series has the main character Isaac Clarke carry a wrist-mounted [[tachyon]]-based stasis module, used to slow enemy Necromorphs to a crawl for a short period of time. He adapted its use to fight Necromorphs; it was used previously by technicians to slow down malfunctioning equipment that moves at dangerously high speeds, such as doors. Medical use of the technology is later seen in ''[[Dead Space 2]]'', with stasis beds; the [[protagonist]] had also been kept in stasis for the majority of the time between games.\n\nThe game ''[[Mass Effect]]'' has a [[Mass effect#Biotics|biotic power]] simply called \"Stasis\" that can trap an enemy in a stasis field rendering them immobile as well as invincible to all forms of damage. The duration of this effect is usually dependent on the user's skill level.\n\nIn the [[Star Wars]] [[Role-playing game|RPG]] series ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', [[Jedi]] who follow the path of the light are able to use \"Stasis\" powers, using the force to alter time and freeze an enemy in place. Unlike true stasis, this stasis allows external events to affect the victim so someone held by stasis can be killed while unable to retaliate. The original game also uses a similar effect when Dark Jedi trap party members to engage the player in a duel.\n\nIn the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode \"The Cat and the Canary\", [[Green Arrow]] uses a stunner to put himself into a form of stasis while fighting [[Wildcat (DC Comics)|Wildcat]]. It was an attempt to end Wildcat's cage fighting career by falsely convincing him he killed Green Arrow during their fight.\n\nIn the ''[[Invader Zim]]'' episode \"Walk For Your Lives\", Zim creates a time stasis field and uses it on Dib as an experiment to show to the Tallest, as a result Dib can move only very slowly. Also produced is an explosion, which is also exploding very slowly, Zim decides to throw Dib into the explosion to cause it to speed up. The explosion then explodes at normal speed. \n\nThe Space themed MMO ''[[Eve Online]]'' features a weapon called a stasis webifier. When activated against an enemy ship it reduces the target's speed, making them easier to hit and keep in range. The weapon affords no protection to its target, and multiple 'webs' can be used on a ship at once, effectively stopping it dead.\n\nIn ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half Life]]'', the protagonist Gordon Freeman is put into a state of Stasis after a brief discussion with the G-Man. A similar incidence happens to Adrian Shepherd at the end of ''[[Half-Life: Opposing Force|Half Life: Opposing Force]]'', when the G-Man puts him into a state of stasis \"for further evaluation\".\n\nIn ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', Chell, the protagonist, is dragged away at the end of the game and put in stasis for many years, until she is awakened at the beginning of ''[[Portal 2]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Project Eden (video game)|Project Eden]]'' one character is frozen in stasis for 15 years. Stasis can also be used offensively to slow down enemies.\n\nIn the first episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', \"The End\", third-class technician of the mining ship \"Red Dwarf\", [[Dave Lister]], is put into a stasis booth as punishment for not revealing the whereabouts of his unquarantined cat. However, during his time in stasis, lethal radiation leaks into the ship as a result of a malfunction, killing all the crew (aside from his cat, which was in the cargo hold). Lister is then revived three million years later by the ship's computer, Holly, when the high radiation levels have subsided.\n\nIn [[Catherine Asaro]]'s [[Saga of the Skolian Empire|Skolian Empire]] books, the Skolians use [[quasis]] to freeze time during [[interstellar travel]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Science fiction themes]]\n[[Category:Fictional technology]]\n[[Category:Time in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{essay-like|date=February 2015}}\n{{one source|date=February 2015}}\n{{original research|date=February 2015}}\n{{weasel|date=February 2015}}\n}}\nA '''stasis''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|e\u026a|s|\u026a|s}} or '''stasis field''', in [[science fiction]], is a confined area of space in which time has been stopped or the contents have been rendered motionless.\n\n==Overview==\nA stasis field is imagined to be a region in which a stasis process is in effect.

Under the management of [[Gordon Strachan]] he proved himself to be a solid defensive midfielder, helping the attacking [[Dion Dublin|Dublin]]-[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]] Coventry side of 1998 finish eleventh in the [[Premier League]] and enjoy mid table stability. He is still fondly remembered by Sky Blues fans as being responsible for breaking one of Coventry's longstanding hoodoo's-victory at [[Villa Park]]: Boateng scored twice in the 4\u20131 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park on 27 February 1999, ending Coventry's 63-year-long wait for a league win at the ground.\n\nThe next season Boateng transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a34.5 million.

Under the management of [[Gordon Strachan]] he proved himself to be a solid defensive midfielder, helping the attacking [[Dion Dublin|Dublin]]-[[Darren Huckerby|Huckerby]] Coventry side of 1998 finish eleventh in the [[Premier League]] and enjoy mid table stability. He is still fondly remembered by Sky Blues fans as being responsible for breaking one of Coventry's longstanding hoodoo's-victory at [[Villa Park]]: Boateng scored twice in the 4\u20131 win over [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at Villa Park on 27 February 1999, ending Coventry's 63-year-long wait for a league win at the ground.\n\nThe next season Boateng transferred to Aston Villa for \u00a34.5 million. He proceeded to play 131 matches for Villa, including an [[FA Cup]] final defeat against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2000.

She led the conservative faction at court that resisted the modernists and progressives who wanted to develop Ethiopia along western lines and bring modernity to the country. According to the historians, she was always consulted by the Emperor prior to making important decisions. Thus, Empress Taytu was a key player in the conflict over the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with [[Italy]], which she tore up. Empress Taytu was the first to agitate the hesitant Emperor and other men to stand up for liberty, dignity, and against Italian aggression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zodml.org/discover-nigeria/people/funmilayo-ransome-kuti#.WwVLy4pOnIU|title=Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti|website=ZODML|language=en|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref> Deeply suspicious of European intentions towards Ethiopia, she was a key player in the conflict over the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy, in which the Italian version made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] version did not do so.  The Empress held a hard line against the Italians, and when talks eventually broke down, and Italy invaded the Empire from its [[Eritrea]]n colony, she marched north with the Emperor and the Imperial Army, commanding a force of cannoneers at the historic [[Battle of Adwa]] that resulted in a humiliating defeat for Italy in March 1896. This victory was the most significant of any African army battling European colonialism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002331/233138E.pdf|title=Taytu Betul: The Rise of an Itege|date=2015|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref> Menelik, who often prevaricated and postponed unpleasant decisions by answering \"Yes, tomorrow\" (''Ishi, nega''), found it useful to have his wife be in a powerful enough position to say \"Absolutely not\" (''Imbi'') to people and issues he just did not want to personally offend or refuse.<ref>Prouty (1986), ''Empress Taytu'', p. 42.</ref> \n\nWhen Menelik's health began to decline around 1906, Taytu began to make decisions on his behalf, angering her rivals for power through her appointment of favorites and relatives to most of the positions of power and influence.  Widely resented for her alleged Gonderine xenophobia and nepotism, the nobility of Shoa and Tigray, along with the Wollo relatives of the heir-to-the-throne, [[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], conspired to remove her from state responsibility. In 1910, she was forced from power, and a regency under [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Tessema Nadew]] took over.  Instructed to limit herself to the care of her stricken husband, Taytu faded from the political scene. Taytu and Menelik did not have any children. Menelik died in 1913 and was succeeded by his grandson from a daughter of a previous liaison, [[Lij Iyasu]].  Taytu was banished to the old Palace at [[Entoto]], next to the St. Mary's church she had founded years before, and where her husband had been crowned Emperor.\n\nWhile some believe Taytu may have played a part in the plot that eventually removed Emperor [[Iyasu V]] from the throne in 1916, replacing him with Empress [[Zauditu]], the price for Zauditu's elevation was a divorce from Taytu's nephew Ras [[Gugsa Welle]], who became governor of [[Begemder]]. Zauditu, Menelik II's daughter by yet another previous marriage, had always been close to Empress Taytu and invited Taytu to live with her. Although Taytu declined she resumed advising rulers \"in a modest way,\" to quote Chris Prouty.\n\n== Her final years ==\nTaytu lived out the next few years at the old palace next to the Entoto Maryam Church overlooking [[Addis Ababa]]. She requested permission to go to Gondar in November 1917 to end her days, but was refused; she died three months later.<ref>Prouty (1986), ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 345f.</ref> She is buried next to her husband at the Taeka Negest Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery in Addis Ababa and lives to this day in the memories as the Empress who won liberty against the colonizers. \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Chris Prouty.

She led the conservative faction at court that resisted the modernists and progressives who wanted to develop Ethiopia along western lines and bring modernity to the country. According to the historians, she was always consulted by the Emperor prior to making important decisions. Thus, Empress Taytu was a key player in the conflict over the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with [[Italy]] which she tore up. Empress Taytu was the first to agitate the hesitant Emperor and other men to stand up for liberty, dignity, and against Italian aggression.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://zodml.org/discover-nigeria/people/funmilayo-ransome-kuti#.WwVLy4pOnIU|title=Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti|website=ZODML|language=en|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref> Deeply suspicious of European intentions towards Ethiopia, she was a key player in the conflict over the Treaty of Wuchale with Italy, in which the Italian version made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate, while the [[Amharic language|Amharic]] version did not do so.  The Empress held a hard line against the Italians, and when talks eventually broke down, and Italy invaded the Empire from its [[Eritrea]]n colony, she marched north with the Emperor and the Imperial Army, commanding a force of cannoneers at the historic [[Battle of Adwa]] that resulted in a humiliating defeat for Italy in March 1896. This victory was the most significant of any African army battling European colonialism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002331/233138E.pdf|title=Taytu Betul: The Rise of an Itege|date=2015|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> Menelik, who often prevaricated and postponed unpleasant decisions by answering \"Yes, tomorrow\" (''Ishi, nega''), found it useful to have his wife be in a powerful enough position to say \"Absolutely not\" (''Imbi'') to people and issues he just did not want to personally offend or refuse.<ref>Prouty (1986), ''Empress Taytu'', p. 42.</ref> \n\nWhen Menelik's health began to decline around 1906, Taytu began to make decisions on his behalf, angering her rivals for power through her appointment of favorites and relatives to most of the positions of power and influence.  Widely resented for her alleged Gonderine xenophobia and nepotism, the nobility of Shoa and Tigray, along with the Wollo relatives of the heir-to-the-throne, [[Iyasu V|Lij Iyasu]], conspired to remove her from state responsibility. In 1910, she was forced from power, and a regency under [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Tessema Nadew]] took over.  Instructed to limit herself to the care of her stricken husband, Taytu faded from the political scene. Taytu and Menelik did not have any children. Menelik died in 1913 and was succeeded by his grandson from a daughter of a previous liaison, [[Lij Iyasu]].  Taytu was banished to the old Palace at [[Entoto]], next to the St. Mary's church she had founded years before, and where her husband had been crowned Emperor.\n\nWhile some believe Taytu may have played a part in the plot that eventually removed Emperor [[Iyasu V]] from the throne in 1916, replacing him with Empress [[Zauditu]], the price for Zauditu's elevation was a divorce from Taytu's nephew Ras [[Gugsa Welle]], who became governor of [[Begemder]]. Zauditu, Menelik II's daughter by yet another previous marriage, had always been close to Empress Taytu and invited Taytu to live with her. Although Taytu declined she resumed advising rulers \"in a modest way,\" to quote Chris Prouty.\n\n== Her final years ==\nTaytu lived out the next few years at the old palace next to the Entoto Maryam Church overlooking [[Addis Ababa]]. She requested permission to go to Gondar in November 1917 to end her days, but was refused; she died three months later.<ref>Prouty (1986), ''Empress Taytu'', pp. 345f.</ref> She is buried next to her husband at the Taeka Negest Ba'eta Le Mariam Monastery in Addis Ababa and lives to this day in the memories as the Empress who won liberty against the colonizers. \n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Chris Prouty.
