In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

A ball of dough is taken with one hand and smeared into a heated large flat metal plate greased with oil until a very thin circular film of it adheres to the pan and fries.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots.

They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

By January 2016 it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially direct the project for CBS Films. \u00d8vredal was later to set to direct the film, with del Toro, Daniel, Brown, and Grave being among the producers. [[Principal photography]] commenced on August 27, 2018, and ended on November 1, 2018, in [[St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada]].\n\n''Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark'' was theatrically released on August 9, 2019, by\u00a0[[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the horror elements, characters, acting, and accuracy to the original [[Stephen Gammell]] illustrations,  although it did receive some critcism for the screenplay and CGI effects on the monsters, and grossed a worldwide total of $105 million against a production budget of around $28 million.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Halloween, 1968, in the town of Mill Valley, [[Pennsylvania]], three teen friends, Stella, Auggie, and Chuck, prank bully Tommy Milner. When Tommy and his gang chase them in retaliation, the trio flees to a drive-in movie theater, where a young drifter named Ram\u00f3n hides them in his car. They invite Ram\u00f3n to explore a local \"haunted house\" that once belonged to the wealthy Bellows family, who helped found Mill Valley. Inside, they find a secret room and a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside the room along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. They escape, and Stella takes Sarah's book.\n\nStella discovers a new story, entitled \"Harold,\" being written in Sarah's book. Meanwhile, in reality, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold, his family's scarecrow, after it comes to life. The creature stabs him with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. Tommy is later reported missing; Stella and Ram\u00f3n find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes. Though Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, the others are skeptical.\n\nThat night, a new story, \"The Big Dick,\" appears with Auggie as the main character. The pair attempt to warn him about the monster: a zombie searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unwittingly eats. Auggie disappears after the zombie drags him under his bed. Realizing they are next, the remaining friends attempt to destroy the book; when this proves impossible, they decide to research Sarah Bellows' life in hopes of finding a solution. A new story, \"The Red Spot,\" is written. When Ruth discovers a swollen [[spider bite]] on her cheek, she squeezes it, and it explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and placed in a [[mental institution]].\n\nThe group's investigation take them to a local hospital, where they discover that Sarah's brother performed [[electroshock therapy]] on her as part of a cover-up operation. The family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and Sarah was tortured by her family for trying to reveal the truth. At the hospital, Chuck is attacked by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his recurring nightmares, who absorbs him. Stella and Ram\u00f3n are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ram\u00f3n is a [[Vietnam War]] [[Draft evasion|draft dodger]]. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ram\u00f3n realizes that the next creature will be the Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner before attempting to kill Ram\u00f3n. Ram\u00f3n and Stella escape, and he lures the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to try to reason with Sarah.\n\nStella is taken back in time, living out part of Sarah's experience as the Bellows family terrorizes her. Stella promises Sarah's ghost that she will tell the real story of Sarah's life if she stops killing. Sarah forces her to write the true story in the book in blood before she and the Jangly Man vanish.

The screenplay was adapted by Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman, from a screen story by producer [[Guillermo del Toro]], as well as [[Patrick Melton]] and [[Marcus Dunstan]]. The film, an international co-production of the United States and Canada, stars Zoe Colletti, [[Michael Garza]], Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur, Natalie Ganzhorn, [[Austin Abrams]], [[Dean Norris]], [[Gil Bellows]], and [[Lorraine Toussaint]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark (2019) |url=https://letterboxd.com/film/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-2019/ |website=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=8 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=MCCLUSKEY |first1=MEGAN |title=How Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Sets Up a Possible Sequel |url=https://time.com/5646688/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-ending/ |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=8 January 2020 |language=en |date=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[CBS Films]] acquired the rights to the book series from 1212 Entertainment<ref name=\"deadline.com\">https://deadline.com/2013/12/cbs-films-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-movie-saw-patrick-melton-marcus-dunstan-646713/</ref> with the intent of producing it as a feature film. By January 2016 it was announced that del Toro would develop and potentially direct the project for CBS Films. \u00d8vredal was later to set to direct the film, with del Toro, Daniel, Brown, and Grave being among the producers. [[Principal photography]] commenced on August 27, 2018, and ended on November 1, 2018, in [[St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada]].\n\n''Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark'' was theatrically released on August 9, 2019, by\u00a0[[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the horror elements, characters, acting, and accuracy to the original [[Stephen Gammell]] illustrations,  although it did receive some critcism for the screenplay and CGI effects on the monsters, and grossed a worldwide total of $105 million against a production budget of around $28 million.\n\n==Plot==\nOn Halloween, 1968, in the town of Mill Valley, [[Pennsylvania]], three teen friends, Stella, Auggie, and Chuck, prank bully Tommy Milner. When Tommy and his gang chase them in retaliation, the trio flees to a drive-in movie theater, where a young drifter named Ram\u00f3n hides them in his car. They invite Ram\u00f3n to explore a local \"haunted house\" that once belonged to the wealthy Bellows family, who helped found Mill Valley. Inside, they find a secret room and a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows. Having followed the group, Tommy locks them inside the room along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. They escape, and Stella takes Sarah's book.\n\nStella discovers a new story, entitled \"Harold,\" being written in Sarah's book. Meanwhile, in reality, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold, his family's scarecrow, after it comes to life. The creature stabs him with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. Tommy is later reported missing; Stella and Ram\u00f3n find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes. Though Stella is convinced that Tommy has been turned into a scarecrow, the others are skeptical.\n\nThat night, a new story, \"The Big Toe,\" appears with Auggie as the main character. The pair attempt to warn him about the monster: a zombie searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unwittingly eats. Auggie disappears after the zombie drags him under his bed. Realizing they are next, the remaining friends attempt to destroy the book; when this proves impossible, they decide to research Sarah Bellows' life in hopes of finding a solution. A new story, \"The Red Spot,\" is written. When Ruth discovers a swollen [[spider bite]] on her cheek, she squeezes it, and it explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized and placed in a [[mental institution]].\n\nThe group's investigation take them to a local hospital, where they discover that Sarah's brother performed [[electroshock therapy]] on her as part of a cover-up operation. The family's mill had been poisoning the town's water with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and Sarah was tortured by her family for trying to reveal the truth. At the hospital, Chuck is attacked by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his recurring nightmares, who absorbs him. Stella and Ram\u00f3n are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ram\u00f3n is a [[Vietnam War]] [[Draft evasion|draft dodger]]. Turner's dog begins to act strangely, and Ram\u00f3n realizes that the next creature will be the Jangly Man, a monster from a campfire story that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man kills Turner before attempting to kill Ram\u00f3n. Ram\u00f3n and Stella escape, and he lures the creature away while Stella goes to the Bellows house to try to reason with Sarah.\n\nStella is taken back in time, living out part of Sarah's experience as the Bellows family terrorizes her. Stella promises Sarah's ghost that she will tell the real story of Sarah's life if she stops killing. Sarah forces her to write the true story in the book in blood before she and the Jangly Man vanish. Ram\u00f3n accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. Stella drives away with her father and a recovered Ruth, and the film ends as she states that she believes they can still find a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie.\n\n==Cast==\n===The Kids===\n* Zoe Colletti as Stella Nicholls\n*[[Michael Garza]] as Ram\u00f3n Morales\n* Gabriel Rush as August \"Auggie\" Hilderbrandt\n* Austin Zajur as Charlie \"Chuck\" Steinberg\n* Natalie Ganzhorn as Ruth \"Ruthie\" Steinberg\n\n===Mill Valley Townspeople===\n* [[Austin Abrams]] as Tommy Milner\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Roy Nicholls\n* [[Gil Bellows]] as Police Chief Turner\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as Louise \"Lou Lou\" Baptiste\n** Ajanae Stephenson as Young Louise Baptiste\n* Marie Ward as Mrs. Hilderbrandt\n* Deborah Pollitt as Mrs. Steinberg\n* Matt Smith as Mr. Steinberg\n* Karen Glave as Claire Baptiste\n* [[Kyle Labine]] as Deputy Hobbs\n* Victoria Fodor as Mrs. Milner\n\n===The Monsters===\n* [[Javier Botet]] as Big Toe Corpse\n* Troy James as Jangly Man\n** [[Andrew Jackson (actor)|Andrew Jackson]] as the voice of the Jangly Man\n* Mark Steger as Harold the Scarecrow and the Pale Lady\n\n===The Bellows Family===\n* Kathleen Pollard as Sarah Bellows\n* Will Carr as Dr. Ephraim Bellows\n** Elias Edraki as the voice of Dr. Ephraim Bellows\n* Jane Moffat as Delanie Bellows\n* Amanda Smith as Gertrude Bellows\n* Brandon Knox as Harold Bellows\n* Hume Baugh as Deodat Bellows\n\n==Production==\nIn 2013, [[CBS Films]] acquired the rights to the [[Alvin Schwartz (children's author)|Alvin Schwartz]]'s children's book series ''[[Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark]]'' from 1212 Entertainment,<ref name=\"deadline.com\"/> with the intent of producing it as a potential feature film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2013/12/cbs-films-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-movie-saw-patrick-melton-marcus-dunstan/ |title=CBS Films Nabs \u2018Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark\u2019 Pitch From \u2018Saw\u2019 Scribes |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> It was announced in 2014 that writer [[John August]] had been set to pen a film version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themovienetwork.com/article/scary-stories-tell-dark-will-get-rewritten-frankenweenie-writer-john-august |title='Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark' Will Get Rewritten by 'Frankenweenie' Writer John August |publisher=DTheMovieNetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2014-11-18}}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2016, it was announced that [[Guillermo del Toro]] would develop the film, as well as possibly direct, and that he would also produce along with [[Sean Daniel]], Jason Brown, and Elizabeth Grave, with Roberto Grande and Joshua Long executive producing.<ref name=\"deadline.com\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Guillermo Del Toro Warms To \u2018Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark\u2019|url=https://deadline.com/2016/01/guillermo-del-toro-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-alvin-schwartz-cbs-films-1201682700/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=Deadline|date=January 14, 2016}}</ref> In February 2016, CBS Films hired screenwriting brothers duo Dan and Kevin Hageman to polish the draft written by August.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u2018Scary Stories\u2019 Lands \u2018Lego Movie\u2019 Writers|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/scary-stories-writers-guillermo-del-toro-1201714263/|accessdate=February 26, 2016|work=Variety|date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> In December 2017, it was reported that [[Andr\u00e9 \u00d8vredal]] would direct the film.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jr|first1=Mike Fleming|title=\u2018The Autopsy Of Jane Doe\u2019 Helmer Andre Ovredal To Direct \u2018Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark\u2019 For CBS Films|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/andre-ovredal-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-guillermo-del-toro-cbs-films-1202222381/|accessdate=May 28, 2018|work=Deadline|date=December 7, 2017}}</ref> The Hagemans received final screenplay credit, with del Toro, [[Patrick Melton]], and [[Marcus Dunstan]] receiving \"story by\" credit.

The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail.

The 22 Charger originally came with a black laminated wood pistol stock with forend, a {{convert|10|in|mm|0|adj=on}} matte blued heavy barrel, a [[bipod]], and a [[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] style scope base in lieu of iron sights. Overall length is just under {{convert|20|in|mm|abbr=out}}, making it quite large for a handgun. As it has an included bipod it is likely to be used from a shooting bench or table. The bipod attaches to a sling swivel on the stock fore-end and is easily removable. Due to technical features, such as the magazine being outside the pistol grip, the Charger is not legally available in some U.S. states.

At the same time a \"Takedown\" model was introduced with a green laminate stock. Both models were later offered from September 2015 with black polymer stocks.\n\n=== 50th Anniversary Rifle ===\nIn 2014 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Ruger 10/22 a contest was held to design an anniversary model.

The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round polymer [[rotary magazine]], the '''BX-1'''.  Ruger has also introduced a transparent [[polycarbonate]] version (\"40th-anniversary edition\") of the BX-1 called the '''BX-1CLR''', as well as a 1-round version for training and a 5-round version for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities.  In 2011\u20132012, Ruger came out with the '''BX-25''', a curved 25-round [[box magazine]] with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round '''BX-15''' box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities.  Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round [[drum magazine]]s.\n\nThe standard BX-1 rotary magazine stores the cartridges in a [[cogwheel]]-like holder, rather than stacked as seen in a box magazine.  This allows the magazine to be very compact and fit flush into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry.  The [[bolt (firearm)|bolt]] of the rifle pushes a cartridge from the metal feeding lip of the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place.  Due to its time-tested reliability, the rotary magazine is also used by the Ruger's [[Ruger American Rifle#Ruger American Rimfire|American Rimfire]] series [[bolt-action rifle]]s, as well as the 10/22-footprinted \"Summit\" toggle-action rifles produced by Primary Weapon Systems/Vorquartsen.  Even Ruger's market competitor [[Savage Arms]] has recently adopted a detachable rotary magazine design similar to the BX-1 in its new A series (semi-automatic) and B series (bolt-action) rimfire rifles.\n\nNot all Ruger 10/22 magazines are interchangeable.  The owners manual for the 10/22 Magnum model states, \"Do not attempt to use standard 10/22 magazines in the 10/22 Magnum rifles or load [[.22 Short]], [[.22 Long|Long]], or Long Rifle ammunition into the [[.22 Magnum]].

It was designed as a quality adult gun (with adult ergonomics) and not a (stereotypically cheap) \"[[Rifle#Youth_rifle|youth rifle]]\".  It was styled as reminiscent of the U.S. 30 caliber [[M1 carbine]] adding to its appeal.

The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two-screw, V-block system to attach the barrel to the receiver, making removal and replacement of the barrel (which would require a gunsmith's work with most other rifles) very easy. This, when combined with the simple construction of the rest of the components, means that the average person can easily replace any part in the gun with nothing more than a screwdriver, a [[hex key]] and simple [[Punch (metalworking)#Pin|punches]].\n\n[[File:Ruger 10-22 (2).JPG|thumb|Ruger 10/22 \"Stainless\" With an aftermarket Butler Creek Folding Stock and a TRUGLO Red Dot Sight]]\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Ruger 10 22 International.png|thumb|320px|Ruger 10/22 International model, which comes with a full-length Mannlicher style stock]]\n\nThe 10/22 is available in a wide variety of configurations.

The cartridges have a smaller case diameter and can split or burst when fired in the larger magnum chamber, releasing hot powder gasses and particle fragments out of the action at high speed, possibly resulting in injury to the shooter or bystanders.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Instruction Manual for Ruger\u00ae 10/22\u00ae Autoloading Rifles|date=2015|publisher=Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc|location=Newport, New Hampshire|url=http://ruger-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_manuals/1022.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Intratec TEC-22]], a pistol that feeds from 10/22 magazines.\n\n{{clear right}}\u2022 Tips and tricks:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The pins holding the trigger assembly can be   replaced with larger pins measuring 4.8x31.8mm (metric)\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> the pin holding the mag release, and the pi  holding the bolt release and ejector can be replaced by larger pins measuring 3.2mm \n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Ruger 10/22}}\n* [http://www.ruger.com/products/1022/overview.html Official website]\n\n{{Ruger}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ruger 10 22}}\n[[Category:.22 LR semi-automatic rifles]]\n[[Category:Ruger rifles|10 22]]\n[[Category:Rotary magazine firearms]]\n", "name_user": "Skye.nel", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruger_10/22"}

At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST).

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA).

Millhouse held his seat ([[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]]) at the [[1977 South Australian state election|1977]] and [[1979 South Australian state election|1979]] state elections. In 1982, Millhouse resigned to take up a senior judicial appointment, and [[Heather Southcott]] won the [[1982 Mitcham state by-election|by-election]] for the Democrats, but lost the seat to the Liberals later that year at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 state election]].

In South Australia, a second senator, [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]], was elected for a 3-year term, as were incumbent Michael Macklin (Queensland) and [[Jean Jenkins (politician)|Jean Jenkins]] (Western Australia).\n1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat of [[Division of Kingston|Kingston]].\n\nThe casual vacancy was filled by [[Meg Lees]] several months before the election of [[Cheryl Kernot]] in place of retired deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the party's national parliamentary deputy leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.<ref>AD ''National Journal'' June 1990, p.5</ref> In the event, Victorian [[Janet Powell]] was elected as leader and [[John Coulter (politician)|John Coulter]] was chosen as deputy leader.\n\n===1990-1993: Janet Powell and John Coulter===\n\nDespite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote.

Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party's first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell's alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support.

Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm Stott Despoja resigns as Democrats leader] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115013317/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s655339.htm |date=15 January 2005 }}, ABC 7.30 Report, 21 August 2002</ref> It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator [[Andrew Bartlett]] as leader.  While the public fighting stopped, the public support for the party remained at record lows.\n\nOn 6 December 2003, Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he swore at [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] Senator [[Jeannie Ferris]] on the floor of [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] while intoxicated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/06/1070625583872.html |title=Disgraced leader steps aside |work=The Age |date= 7 December 2003 |accessdate=3 April 2007 |location=Melbourne, Australia}}</ref> The party issued a statement stating that deputy leader [[Lyn Allison]] would serve as the acting leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.\n\n===Decline===\nFollowing internal conflict over [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (1998\u20132001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the [[Australian Greens]] who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial [[third party (politics)|third party]]. The trend was noted that year by political scientists [[Dean Jaensch]] et al.<ref>\"the Australian Democrats appear to be in decline, having performed very poorly at the 2004 federal election and look to be replaced by the Greens as the major 'minor' party\". --Jaensch D. et al.

Australian National University, January 2005</ref>\n\nSupport for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]] in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban [[Adelaide]] in South Australia, where they received between 1 and 4 percent of the lower house vote; by comparison, they tallied between 7 and 31 per cent of the vote in 2001. Three incumbent senators were defeated\u2014[[Aden Ridgeway]] (NSW), [[Brian Greig]] (WA) and [[John Cherry (Australian politician)|John Cherry]] (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Allison as leader, with Bartlett as her deputy. From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate\u2014the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980.\n\n====Death of Chipp====\nOn 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died.

At the [[1977 Australian federal election|1977 federal election]], the Democrats polled 11.1 percent of the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] vote and secured two seats. The party would retain a presence in the Senate for the next 30 years, at its peak (between 1999 and 2002) holding nine out of 76 seats, though never securing a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]]. The party's share of the vote collapsed at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 election]] and was further diminished [[2007 Australian federal election|in 2007]] with the last senators leaving office in 2008.\n\nDue to the party's numbers in the Senate, both Liberal and [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] governments required the assistance of the Democrats to pass contentious legislation, most notably in the case of the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Goods and services tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST).

Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party [[ombudsman]] and membership ballot.\n\nPolicies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and [[sustainability]], opposition to the primacy of [[economic rationalism]] (Australian [[neoliberalism]]), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.\n\nThe Australian Democrats were the first representatives of [[green politics]] at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'' of the [[Franklin Dam controversy#Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election|Franklin River Dam]].\n\nThe party's centrist role made it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp's former [[Liberal Party of Australia|conservative]] affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left.<ref group=\"n\">Such as the then [[Democratic Socialist Perspective|Socialist Workers' Party]] and early green-left parties such as the [[United Tasmania Group]].</ref> This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party's founders.<ref group=\"n\">The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader [[Janet Powell]] in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993 decision of the party's national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members' ''National Journal'' and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material.</ref>\n\nBecause of their numbers on the cross benches during the [[Hawke Government|Hawke]] and [[Keating Government|Keating]] governments, the Democrats were sometimes regarded as exercising a [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]\u2014which attracted electoral support from a significant sector of the electorate which had been alienated by both Labor and Coalition policies and practices.\n\nOver three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]], South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as [[Australian Senate|Senate]] seats in all six states. However, at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004]] and [[2007 Australian federal election|2007]] federal elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.<ref name=\"results.aec.gov.au\">{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm |title=2007 Senate election: (National tally of) First Preferences by Group |publisher=Results.aec.gov.au |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143042/http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/website/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-13745-NAT.htm| archivedate= 5 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The last remaining State parliamentarian, [[David Winderlich]], left the party and was defeated as an independent in [[2010 South Australian state election#Upper house|2010]].\n\n==History==\n\n===1977\u20131986: Foundation and Don Chipp's leadership===\nThe Australian Democrats were formed in May 1977 from an amalgamation of the [[Australia Party]] and the [[New Liberal Movement]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp0809/09rp25|title=Australian Democrats: the passing of an era|last=7111|first=corporateName=Commonwealth Parliament; address=Parliament House, Canberra, ACT, 2600; contact=+61 2 6277|website=www.aph.gov.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\nThe two groups found a common basis for a new political movement in the widespread discontent with the two major parties.

In 1980, this increased to five seats with the election of Michael Macklin (QLD) and John Siddons (VIC) and the re-election of Janine Haines (SA). Thereafter they frequently held enough seats to give them the balance of power in the upper chamber.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Australian-Democrats|title=Australian Democrats {{!}} political party, Australia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAt a Melbourne media conference on 19 September 1980, in the midst of the [[1980 Australian federal election|1980 election campaign]], Chipp described his party's aim as to \"keep the bastards honest\"\u2014the \"bastards\" being the major parties and/or politicians in general.

Millhouse held his seat ([[Electoral district of Mitcham (South Australia)|Mitcham]]) at the [[1977 South Australian state election|1977]] and [[1979 South Australian state election|1979]] state elections. In 1982, Millhouse resigned to take up a senior judicial appointment, and [[Heather Southcott]] won the [[1982 Mitcham state by-election|by-election]] for the Democrats, but lost the seat to the Liberals later that year at the [[1982 South Australian state election|1982 state election]]. Mitcham was the only single-member lower-house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats.\n\n===1986\u20131990: Janine Haines' leadership===\n[[File:HainesChipp.jpg|thumb|[[Janine Haines]] and [[Don Chipp]], the first two leaders of the Australian Democrats]]\nDon Chipp resigned from the Senate on 18 August 1986, being succeeded as party leader by Janine Haines and replaced as a senator for Victoria by [[Janet Powell]].\n\nAt the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 election]] following a [[double dissolution]], the reduced [[Australian Senate#Voting system|quota]] of 7.7% necessary to win a seat assisted the election of three new senators. 6-year terms were won by [[Paul McLean (politician)|Paul McLean]] (NSW) and incumbents Janine Haines (South Australia) and Janet Powell (Victoria).
