This period has also been seen as an English translation of the [[German language|German]] term '''''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'''''<ref group=\"note\">Literally \"wandering of peoples\". The term ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderungszeit}}'' is the German for \"Migration Period\". See [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/v%C3%B6lkerwanderung ''V\u00f6lkerwanderung'' according to Collins].</ref> It is also sometimes called \u2014 from the Roman and Greek perspective \u2014 the period of '''Barbarian Invasions'''.<ref>Halsall, Guy. Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568. Cambridge University Press, 2007.</ref> \n\nHistorians give differing dates regarding the duration of this period, but the Migration Period is typically regarded as beginning with the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in 375 and ending either with the conquest of Italy by the [[Lombards]] in 568,<ref>As shown in the title of Halsall, (2008), ''Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568''</ref> or at some point between 700 and 800.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FYO7UBBhWKIC&pg=PA5 \"The Migration period (fourth to eighth century)\"], p.5 ''Migration Art, A.D. 300-800'', 1995, Metropolitan Museum of Art, ed. Katharine Reynolds Brown, {{ISBN|0870997505}}, 9780870997501 </ref>  Various factors contributed to this phenomenon, and the role and significance of each one is still very much discussed among experts on the subject. Starting in 382, the Roman Empire and individual tribes [[Foederati|made treaties]] regarding their settlement in its territory. The [[Franks]], a Germanic tribe that would later found [[Francia]]\u2014a predecessor of modern [[France]] and [[Germany]]\u2014settled in the Roman Empire and were given the task of securing the northeastern [[Gaul]] border. Western Roman rule was first violated with the [[Crossing of the Rhine]] and the following invasions of the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]]. With wars ensuing between various tribes, as well as local populations in the Western Roman Empire, more and more power was transferred to Germanic and Roman militaries.\n\nThere are contradicting opinions whether the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] was a result or a cause of these migrations, or both. The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was less affected by migrations and survived until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1453. In the modern period, the Migration Period was increasingly described with a rather negative connotation, and seen more as contributing to the fall of the empire. In place of the fallen Western Rome, [[Barbarian kingdoms]] arose in the 5th and 6th centuries and decisively shaped the European [[Early Middle Ages]].\n\nThe migrants comprised war bands or tribes of 10,000 to 20,000 people,<ref name=\"Heather2003\">{{cite book|author=Peter Heather|title=The Visigoths from the Migration Period to the Seventh Century: An Ethnographic Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MADmH2eaGIC&pg=PA54|year=2003|publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd|isbn=978-1-84383-033-7|page=54}}</ref> but in the course of 100 years they numbered not more than 750,000 in total, compared to an average 39.9&nbsp;million population of the Roman Empire at that time.

It is this western group which was described by the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (AD&nbsp;56\u2013117) and Julius Caesar (100\u201344&nbsp;BC).

They were followed into Roman territory first by a confederation of [[Heruli]]an, [[Rugians|Rugian]], and [[Scirii|Scirian]] warriors, under [[Odoacer]], that deposed [[Romulus Augustulus]] on 4 September 476, and later by the [[Ostrogoths]], led by [[Theodoric the Great]], who settled in Italy. In [[Gaul]], the Franks (a fusion of western Germanic tribes whose leaders had been aligned with Rome since the third century AD) entered Roman lands gradually during the fifth century, and after consolidating power under [[Childeric I|Childeric]] and his son [[Clovis I|Clovis\u2019s]] decisive victory over [[Syagrius]] in 486, established themselves as rulers of northern Roman Gaul.

During the [[Khazar\u2013Arab Wars]], the Khazars stopped the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]] into [[Europe]] across the Caucasus (7th and 8th centuries). At the same time, the Moors (consisting of [[Arab]]s and [[Berber people|Berbers]]) invaded Europe via [[Gibraltar]] ([[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquering Hispania]]\u2014the [[Iberian Peninsula]]\u2014from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in 711), before being halted. These battles broadly demarcated the frontiers between [[Christendom]] and [[Muslim world|Islam]] for the next millennium. The following centuries saw the Muslims successful in [[History of Islam in southern Italy|conquering most of Sicily]] from the Christians by 902.\n\nThe [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin]] from around 895 and the following [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], and the [[Viking expansion]] from the late 8th century conventionally mark the last large movements of the period. Christianity [[Christianization#Christianization of Europe (7th\u201315th centuries)|gradually converted]] the non-Islamic newcomers and integrated them into the medieval Christian order.

The consequences of this cold period are debated.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n== {{anchor|Modern discourse}}Discussions ==\n=== Barbarian identity ===\n{{Main|Barbarians}}\n\nAnalysis of barbarian identity and how it was created and expressed during the Barbarian Invasions has elicited discussion among scholars. [[Herwig Wolfram]], a historian of the Goths,<ref>Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr. ''History of the Goths'' (1979) 1988:5</ref> in discussing the equation of ''migratio gentium'' with ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'', observes that Michael Schmidt introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of ''[[gens]]'' as a biological community was shifting, even during the [[early Middle Ages]] and that \"to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of [[nationhood]] created during the [[French Revolution]]\".\n\nThe \"primordialistic\"<ref>Anthony D. Smith, ''The Ethnic Origins of Nations'' (Oxford, 1966) pp. 6ff., coined the term to separate these thinkers from those who view ethnicity as a situational construct, the product of history, rather than a cause, influenced by a variety of political, economic and cultural factors.</ref> paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars, such as German linguist [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|2006|p = 29}}</ref> He also believed that the ''Volk'' were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These characteristics were seen as intrinsic, unaffected by external influences, even conquest.<ref name=\"harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46\">{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46}}</ref> Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry.<ref>That was influenced by the 'family tree' model (''{{lang|de|Stammbaun}}'') of linguistics in that relationships between related languages were seen to be the result of derivation from a [[common descent|common ancestor]]. The model still is very influential in linguistics</ref> This was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideal that there once had been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a [[lingua franca|common tongue]], helping to provide a [[conceptual framework]] for [[political movement]]s of the 18th and 19th centuries such as [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]].<ref name=\"harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46\" />\n\nFrom the 1960s, a reinterpretation of archaeological and historic evidence prompted scholars, such as Goffart and Todd, to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity. They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the ''Germani'';<ref name=\"Halsall 2008 17\">{{harvtxt|Halsall|2008|p = 17}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Todd|pp = 8\u201310}} There is no indication that the Germani possessed a feeling that they were a \"separate people, nation, or group of tribes\"</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 29}}</ref> a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups.<ref>For example, ''The Celtic World'', Miranda Green (1996), p. 3 and ''The Making of the Slavs''. Floring Curta (2001)</ref>\n\nA theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a ''[[prima facie]]'' interpretation of [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as ''Germanoi'', ''Keltoi'' or ''Sclavenoi'', thus encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and [[economic interest]]s rather than biological or racial distinctions.\n\nThe role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since large-scale language shifts occur commonly in history.<ref>''Archaeology and LanguageL:Correlating Archaeological and Linguistic Hypotheses''. \"The Eurasian Spread Zone and the Indo-European Dispersal.\" [[Johanna Nichols]]. p. 224</ref> Modernists propose the idea of \"imagined communities\"; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 48}}</ref> The process of forming tribal units was called \"[[ethnogenesis]]\", a term coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scholar [[Yulian Bromley]].<ref>{{harvtxt |Halsall|2008|p = 15}}</ref> The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick Geary.<ref name=\"Halsall 2008 17\" /> It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the ''{{lang|de|Traditionskern}}'' (\"kernel of tradition\"), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage.<ref name=\"harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77\">{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The common, track-filled map of the ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'' may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads. Unfolded over long periods of time, the changes of position that took place were necessarily irregular&nbsp;... (with) periods of emphatic discontinuity.

In addition, Rome increasingly used foreign mercenaries to defend itself. That \"barbarisation\" parallelled changes within ''barbaricum''.<ref>{{cite book\n| last1 = Green\n| first1 = D.

Propped up with imperial support and gifts, the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other, hostile, barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman [[economic power]] weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power. The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 49}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region. For example, in [[Aquitaine]], the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall has argued that local rulers simply \"handed over\" military rule to the [[Ostrogoths]], acquiring the identity of the newcomers.<ref name=\"halsall51\" /> In [[Gaul]], the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and [[Alamanni|Alemanni]] were pulled into the ensuing \"power vacuum\",<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 50}}</ref> resulting in conflict. In [[Spain]], local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the [[Vandals]]. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from lowland [[England]] resulted in conflict between [[Saxons]] and the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] chieftains (whose centres of power retreated westward as a result). The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces despite a thinly-spread imperial army relying mainly on local militias and an extensive effort to refortify the Danubian ''limes''. The ambitious fortification efforts collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families.<ref>{{harvtxt|Curta|2001|pp = 120\u2013180}}</ref>\n\nHalsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families, who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands. The process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations.\n\nThe collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces, which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|pp = 50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the Germanic groups in the [[Western Roman Empire]] were accommodated without \"dispossessing or overturning indigenous society\", and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration.<ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 251}}</ref>\n\nIronically, they lost their unique identity as a result of such an  accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood. In contrast, in the east, Slavic tribes maintained a more \"spartan and egalitarian\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Barford|2001|p = 46}}</ref> existence bound to the land \"even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl1998|p = 20}}</ref> Their organizational models were not Roman, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths, the Franks or the [[Saxons]] had on theirs.<ref>{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 146}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nBased on the belief that particular types of artifacts, elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context, are thought to indicate the race and/or ethnicity of the person buried, the \"Culture-History\" school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the ''{{lang|de|[[Urheimat]]}}'' (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|1998|pp = 17\u201323}}</ref> As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples.<ref name=\"Kulikowski 2007 61\">{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 61}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by [[social constructionism|constructionism]], process-driven archaeologists rejected the [[cultural-history archaeology|Culture-Historical]] doctrine<ref name=\"Kulikowski 2007 61\" /> and marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether and focused on the intragroup dynamics that generated such material remains. Moreover, they argued that adoption of new cultures could occur through trade or internal political developments rather than only military takeovers.\n\n== Depiction in media ==\n* ''[[Terry Jones' Barbarians]]'', a 4-part TV documentary series first broadcast on BBC 2 in 2006\n* ''[[Rome: Total War: Barbarian Invasion]]'' and ''[[Total War: Attila]]'', strategy games by ''[[The Creative Assembly]]''\n* ''[[Barbarians (miniseries)]]'', a documentary miniseries on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[Bond event]]\n* [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n* [[Environmental migrant]]\n* [[Genetic history of the British Isles]]\n* [[Late antiquity|Late Antiquity]]\n* [[Medieval demography]]\n* [[Migration Period art]]\n* [[Early Slavs|Slavic migration]]\n* [[Five Barbarians]] and [[Sixteen Kingdoms]]\n* [[Hephthalite Empire]]\n* [[Immigration]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Citation|last = Barford|first = Paul M|year = 2001|publisher = Cornell University Press|title = The Early Slavs: Culture and Society in Early Medieval Eastern Europe|isbn = 0-8014-3977-9}}\n* B\u00f6rm, Henning (2013), ''Westrom.

This period has also been seen as an English translation of the [[German language|German]] term '''''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'''''<ref group=\"note\">Literally \"wandering of peoples\". The term ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderungszeit}}'' is the German for \"Migration Period\".

Barbarian migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568. Cambridge University Press, 2007.</ref> \n\nHistorians give differing dates regarding the duration of this period, but the Migration Period is typically regarded as beginning with the invasion of Europe by the Huns from Asia in 375 and ending either with the conquest of Italy by the [[Lombards]] in 568,<ref>As shown in the title of Halsall, (2008), ''Barbarian Migrations and the Roman West, 376\u2013568''</ref> or at some point between 700 and 800.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FYO7UBBhWKIC&pg=PA5 \"The Migration period (fourth to eighth century)\"], p.5 ''Migration Art, A.D. 300-800'', 1995, Metropolitan Museum of Art, ed. Katharine Reynolds Brown, {{ISBN|0870997505}}, 9780870997501 </ref>  Various factors contributed to this phenomenon, and the role and significance of each one is still very much discussed among experts on the subject. Starting in 382, the Roman Empire and individual tribes [[Foederati|made treaties]] regarding their settlement in its territory. The [[Franks]], a Germanic tribe that would later found [[Francia]]\u2014a predecessor of modern [[France]] and [[Germany]]\u2014settled in the Roman Empire and were given the task of securing the northeastern [[Gaul]] border. Western Roman rule was first violated with the [[Crossing of the Rhine]] and the following invasions of the [[Vandals]] and [[Suebi]]. With wars ensuing between various tribes, as well as local populations in the Western Roman Empire, more and more power was transferred to Germanic and Roman militaries.\n\nThere are contradicting opinions whether the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] was a result or a cause of these migrations, or both. The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was less affected by migrations and survived until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1453. In the modern period, the Migration Period was increasingly described with a rather negative connotation, and seen more as contributing to the fall of the empire.

During the [[Khazar\u2013Arab Wars]], the Khazars stopped the [[Muslim conquests|Arab expansion]] into [[Europe]] across the Caucasus (7th and 8th centuries).

[[Herwig Wolfram]], a historian of the Goths,<ref>Wolfram, Thomas J. Dunlap, tr. ''History of the Goths'' (1979) 1988:5</ref> in discussing the equation of ''migratio gentium'' with ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'', observes that Michael Schmidt introduced the equation in his 1778 history of the Germans. Wolfram observed that the significance of ''[[gens]]'' as a biological community was shifting, even during the [[early Middle Ages]] and that \"to complicate matters, we have no way of devising a terminology that is not derived from the concept of [[nationhood]] created during the [[French Revolution]]\".\n\nThe \"primordialistic\"<ref>Anthony D. Smith, ''The Ethnic Origins of Nations'' (Oxford, 1966) pp. 6ff., coined the term to separate these thinkers from those who view ethnicity as a situational construct, the product of history, rather than a cause, influenced by a variety of political, economic and cultural factors.</ref> paradigm prevailed during the 19th century. Scholars, such as German linguist [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], viewed tribes as coherent biological (racial) entities, using the term to refer to discrete ethnic groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|2006|p = 29}}</ref> He also believed that the ''Volk'' were an organic whole, with a core identity and spirit evident in art, literature and language. These characteristics were seen as intrinsic, unaffected by external influences, even conquest.<ref name=\"harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46\">{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46}}</ref> Language, in particular, was seen as the most important expression of ethnicity. They argued that groups sharing the same (or similar) language possessed a common identity and ancestry.<ref>That was influenced by the 'family tree' model (''{{lang|de|Stammbaun}}'') of linguistics in that relationships between related languages were seen to be the result of derivation from a [[common descent|common ancestor]]. The model still is very influential in linguistics</ref> This was the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideal that there once had been a single German, Celtic or Slavic people who originated from a common homeland and spoke a [[lingua franca|common tongue]], helping to provide a [[conceptual framework]] for [[political movement]]s of the 18th and 19th centuries such as [[Pan-Germanism]] and [[Pan-Slavism]].<ref name=\"harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 46\" />\n\nFrom the 1960s, a reinterpretation of archaeological and historic evidence prompted scholars, such as Goffart and Todd, to propose new models for explaining the construction of barbarian identity. They maintained that no sense of shared identity was perceived by the ''Germani'';<ref name=\"Halsall 2008 17\">{{harvtxt|Halsall|2008|p = 17}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Todd|pp = 8\u201310}} There is no indication that the Germani possessed a feeling that they were a \"separate people, nation, or group of tribes\"</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 29}}</ref> a similar theory having been proposed for Celtic and Slavic groups.<ref>For example, ''The Celtic World'', Miranda Green (1996), p. 3 and ''The Making of the Slavs''. Floring Curta (2001)</ref>\n\nA theory states that the primordialist mode of thinking was encouraged by a ''[[prima facie]]'' interpretation of [[Greco-Roman world|Graeco-Roman]] sources, which grouped together many tribes under such labels as ''Germanoi'', ''Keltoi'' or ''Sclavenoi'', thus encouraging their perception as distinct peoples. Modernists argue that the uniqueness perceived by specific groups was based on common political and [[economic interest]]s rather than biological or racial distinctions.\n\nThe role of language in constructing and maintaining group identity can be ephemeral since large-scale language shifts occur commonly in history.<ref>''Archaeology and LanguageL:Correlating Archaeological and Linguistic Hypotheses''. \"The Eurasian Spread Zone and the Indo-European Dispersal.\" [[Johanna Nichols]]. p. 224</ref> Modernists propose the idea of \"imagined communities\"; the barbarian polities in late antiquity were social constructs rather than unchanging lines of blood kinship.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 48}}</ref> The process of forming tribal units was called \"[[ethnogenesis]]\", a term coined by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scholar [[Yulian Bromley]].<ref>{{harvtxt |Halsall|2008|p = 15}}</ref> The Austrian school (led by Reinhard Wenskus) popularized this idea, which influenced medievalists such as Herwig Wolfram, Walter Pohl and Patrick Geary.<ref name=\"Halsall 2008 17\" /> It argues that the stimulus for forming tribal polities was perpetuated by a small nucleus of people, known as the ''{{lang|de|Traditionskern}}'' (\"kernel of tradition\"), who were a military or aristocratic elite. This core group formed a standard for larger units, gathering adherents by employing amalgamative metaphors such as kinship and aboriginal commonality and claiming that they perpetuated an ancient, divinely-sanctioned lineage.<ref name=\"harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77\">{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 77}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The common, track-filled map of the ''{{lang|de|V\u00f6lkerwanderung}}'' may illustrate such [a] course of events, but it misleads.

Propped up with imperial support and gifts, the armies of allied barbarian chieftains served as buffers against other, hostile, barbarian groups. The disintegration of Roman [[economic power]] weakened groups that had come to depend on Roman gifts for the maintenance of their own power. The arrival of the Huns helped prompt many groups to invade the provinces for economic reasons.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 49}}</ref>\n\nThe nature of the barbarian takeover of former Roman provinces varied from region to region. For example, in [[Aquitaine]], the provincial administration was largely self-reliant. Halsall has argued that local rulers simply \"handed over\" military rule to the [[Ostrogoths]], acquiring the identity of the newcomers.<ref name=\"halsall51\" /> In [[Gaul]], the collapse of imperial rule resulted in anarchy: the Franks and [[Alamanni|Alemanni]] were pulled into the ensuing \"power vacuum\",<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|p = 50}}</ref> resulting in conflict. In [[Spain]], local aristocrats maintained independent rule for some time, raising their own armies against the [[Vandals]]. Meanwhile, the Roman withdrawal from lowland [[England]] resulted in conflict between [[Saxons]] and the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic]] chieftains (whose centres of power retreated westward as a result). The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] attempted to maintain control of the Balkan provinces despite a thinly-spread imperial army relying mainly on local militias and an extensive effort to refortify the Danubian ''limes''. The ambitious fortification efforts collapsed, worsening the impoverished conditions of the local populace and resulting in colonization by Slavic warriors and their families.<ref>{{harvtxt|Curta|2001|pp = 120\u2013180}}</ref>\n\nHalsall and Noble have argued that such changes stemmed from the breakdown in Roman political control, which exposed the weakness of local Roman rule. Instead of large-scale migrations, there were military takeovers by small groups of warriors and their families, who usually numbered only in the tens of thousands. The process involved active, conscious decision-making by Roman provincial populations.\n\nThe collapse of centralized control severely weakened the sense of Roman identity in the provinces, which may explain why the provinces then underwent dramatic cultural changes even though few barbarians settled in them.<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsall|2006|pp = 50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, the Germanic groups in the [[Western Roman Empire]] were accommodated without \"dispossessing or overturning indigenous society\", and they maintained a structured and hierarchical (but attenuated) form of Roman administration.<ref>{{harvtxt|Noble|p = 251}}</ref>\n\nIronically, they lost their unique identity as a result of such an  accommodation and were absorbed into Latinhood. In contrast, in the east, Slavic tribes maintained a more \"spartan and egalitarian\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Barford|2001|p = 46}}</ref> existence bound to the land \"even in times when they took their part in plundering Roman provinces\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl1998|p = 20}}</ref> Their organizational models were not Roman, and their leaders were not normally dependent on Roman gold for success. Thus they arguably had a greater effect on their region than the Goths, the Franks or the [[Saxons]] had on theirs.<ref>{{harvtxt|Geary|2003|p = 146}}</ref>\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nBased on the belief that particular types of artifacts, elements of personal adornment generally found in a funerary context, are thought to indicate the race and/or ethnicity of the person buried, the \"Culture-History\" school of archaeology assumed that archaeological cultures represent the ''{{lang|de|[[Urheimat]]}}'' (homeland) of tribal polities named in historical sources.<ref>{{harvtxt|Pohl|1998|pp = 17\u201323}}</ref> As a consequence, the shifting extensions of material cultures were interpreted as the expansion of peoples.<ref name=\"Kulikowski 2007 61\">{{harvtxt|Kulikowski|2007|p = 61}}</ref>\n\nInfluenced by [[social constructionism|constructionism]], process-driven archaeologists rejected the [[cultural-history archaeology|Culture-Historical]] doctrine<ref name=\"Kulikowski 2007 61\" /> and marginalized the discussion of ethnicity altogether and focused on the intragroup dynamics that generated such material remains.

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

The High [[Middle Ages]] were preceded by the [[Early Middle Ages]] and were followed by the [[Late Middle Ages]], which ended around 1500 (by [[historiography|historiographical]] convention).<ref>John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150-1309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]</ref>\n\nKey historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the [[medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], including the first developments of [[rural exodus]] and of [[urbanization]]. By 1250, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]], most notably the [[Black Death]], but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.\n\nFrom around 780,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Europe saw the last of the [[barbarian invasions]]<ref>''Reiterv\u00f6lker im Fr\u00fchmittelalter.''

The [[Medieval universities|first universities]] started operating in Bologna, Paris, Oxford, Salamanca, Cambridge and Modena. The [[Viking]]s settled in the British Isles, France and elsewhere, and Norse Christian kingdoms started developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Magyars]] ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, a Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]] had become a recognized state in [[Central Europe]] that was forming alliances with regional powers. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century, major nomadic incursions ceased. The powerful [[Byzantine Empire]] of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] and [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenos]] dynasties gradually gave way to the resurrected [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbia]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and to a successor [[Latin Empire|crusader state]] (1204 to 1261), which countered the continuous threat of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Although the Empire was reestablished in 1261 with the recapture of Constantinople, it was no longer a major power and would continue to falter through the 14th century, with remnants lasting until the mid 15th century.  \n\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began a more intensive settlement, targeting \"new\" lands, some of which areas had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the \"great clearances\",<ref>\nSee for example: \n{{cite book\n| last1 = Aberth\n| first1 = John\n| chapter = The early medieval woodland\n| title = An Environmental History of the Middle Ages: The Crucible of Nature\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7a28UnCLPIIC\n| location = Abingdon\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = 87\n| isbn = 9780415779456\n| access-date = 2017-08-17\n| quote = The French historian of the early medieval forest, Charles Higounet, produced a map in the 1960s, which has been much reproduced since, that purports to show the distribution of the forest cover in Europe on the eve of the so-called 'great clearances' (''les grands d\u00e9frichements'') between 1000 and 1300.\n}}\n</ref> Europeans cleared and cultivated some of the vast forests and marshes that lay across much of the continent. At the same time, settlers moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers beyond the [[Elbe River]], which tripled the size of Germany in the process. The [[Catholic Church]], which reached the peak of its political power around then, called armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the Seljuk Turks. The crusaders occupied the [[Holy Land]] and founded the [[Crusader States]] in the [[Levant]]. Other wars led to the [[Northern Crusades]]. The Christian kingdoms [[Reconquista|took much of the Iberian Peninsula]] from [[Muslim]] control, and the [[Normans]] conquered southern Italy, all part of the major population increases and the resettlement patterns of the era.\n\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The age also saw the rise of [[ethnocentrism]], which evolved later into modern [[civic nationalism]]s in most of Europe, the ascent of the great Italian [[city-state]]s and the rise and fall of the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] of [[Al-Andalus]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]], at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and [[Islamic Philosophy]],{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} led [[Maimonides]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes|Muhammad Averroes]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers of the period to expand [[Scholasticism]], a combination of Judeo-Islamic and Catholic ideologies with the ancient philosophy. For much of this period, [[Constantinople]] remained Europe's most populous city, and Byzantine art reached a [[Byzantine civilization in the twelfth century|peak in the 12th century]]. In architecture, many of the most notable [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]] were built or completed around this period.\n\nThe [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]] began at the start of the 14th century and marked the end of the period.\n\n==Historical events and politics==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting the [[Battle of Hastings]] during the Norman invasion of England]]\n\n===Great Britain and Ireland===\n{{Main|England in the Middle Ages|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|History of Gwynedd during the High Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Aleanor of Aqutaine and Henri II.jpg|thumb|The painted effigies of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry II of England]] from the [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in [[Anjou]], France, which no longer houses their remains]]\nIn England, the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 resulted in a kingdom ruled by a [[French language|Francophone]] nobility. The [[Normans]] invaded Ireland by force in 1169 and soon established themselves throughout most of the country, although their stronghold was the southeast. Likewise, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were subdued to vassalage at about the same time, though Scotland later asserted its independence and Wales remained largely under the rule of independent native princes until the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]] in 1282.<ref>Davies, Rees (2001-05-01). \"Wales: A Culture Preserved\". bbc.co.uk/history. p. 3.

In 1215, after the loss of [[Normandy]], [[John of England|King John]] signed the [[Magna Carta]] into law, which limited the power of [[List of monarchs of England|English monarchs]].\n\n===Spain, Portugal, and Italy===\n{{main|Spain in the Middle Ages|Italy in the Middle Ages}}\n\nMuch of the [[Iberian peninsula]] had been occupied by the [[Moors]] after 711, although the northernmost portion was divided between several Christian states. In the 11th century, and again in the thirteenth, the Christian kingdoms of the north gradually drove the Muslims from central and most of southern Iberia.\n\nIn Italy, independent city states grew affluent on eastern maritime trade. These were in particular the [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] of [[Pisa]], [[Amalfi]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].\n\n===Scandinavia===\n{{main|History of Denmark#Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark|History of Norway#The Viking kings|Early Swedish history}}\n\nFrom the mid-tenth to the mid-11th centuries, the Scandinavian kingdoms were unified and Christianized, resulting in an end of [[Viking]] raids, and greater involvement in European politics. King [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] of Denmark ruled over both England and Norway. After Cnut's death in 1035, England and Norway were lost, and with the defeat of [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] in 1227, Danish predominance in the region came to an end. Meanwhile, Norway extended its Atlantic possessions, ranging from [[Greenland]] to the [[Isle of Man]], while Sweden, under [[Birger Jarl]], built up a power-base in the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, the Norwegian influence started to decline already in the same period, marked by the [[Treaty of Perth]] of 1266. Also, [[Civil war era in Norway|civil wars raged in Norway]] between 1130 and 1240.\n\n===France and Germany===\n{{main|France in the Middle Ages|Germany in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:France 1154 Eng.jpg|thumb|200px|France in the 12th century. The [[Angevin Empire|King of England]] held all the red territories.]]\nBy the time of the High Middle Ages, the [[Carolingian Empire]] had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called France and Germany, although not with their modern boundaries. Germany was under the banner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which reached its high-water mark of unity and political power.\n\n===Georgia===\n{{Main|Georgian Golden Age}}\nDuring the successful reign of King [[David IV of Georgia]] (1089\u20131125), [[Kingdom of Georgia]] grew in strength and expelled the [[Seljuk Empire]] from its lands. David's decisive victory in the [[Battle of Didgori]] (1121) against the Seljuk Turks, as a result of which Georgia recaptured its lost capital [[Tbilisi]], marked the beginning of the [[Georgian Golden Age]]. David's granddaughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] continued the upward rise, successfully neutralizing internal opposition and embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by further decline of the hostile [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. Relying on a powerful military \u00e9lite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated vast lands spanning from present-day southern [[Russian Federation|Russia]] on the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Georgia remained a leading regional power until its collapse under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{main|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:SztIstvan 5.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]].]]\nIn the High Middle Ages, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (founded in 1000), became one of the most powerful medieval states in central Europe and Western Europe. King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]] introduced Christianity to the region; he was remembered by the contemporary chroniclers as a very religious monarch, with wide knowledge in Latin grammar, strict with his own people but kind to the foreigners. He eradicated the remnants of the tribal organisation in the Kingdom and forced the people to sedentarize and adopt the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, ethics, way of life and founded the Hungarian medieval state, organising it politically in counties using the Germanic system as a model.\n\nThe following monarchs usually kept a close relationship with Rome like Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and a tolerant attitude with the [[paganism|pagans]] that escaped to the Kingdom searching for sanctuary (for example [[Cumans]] in the 13th century), which eventually created certain discomfort for some [[Pope]]s. With entering in [[Personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)#Controversies|Kingdom of Croatia]] and annexation of other small states, Hungary became a small empire that extended its control over the [[Balkans]] and all the [[Carpathian]] region. The [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] royal house was the one that gave the most saints to the Catholic Church during medieval times.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{main|Grand Duchy of Lithuania}}\nDuring the High Middle Ages Lithuania emerged as a [[Kingdom of Lithuania]]. After the assassination of its first Christian king [[Mindaugas]] Lithuania was known as [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Unconquered during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]], Lithuania itself rapidly expanded to the East due to conquests and became one of the largest states in Europe.\n\n===Poland===\n{{main|History of Poland in the Middle Ages}}\nDuring the High Middle Ages [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland emerged as a kingdom]]. It decided to bond itself with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], confirmed by the [[Union of Krewo]] and later treaties, leading to a personal union in 1569.\n\n===Southeastern Europe===\n[[File:Khazarfall1.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Pontic steppe]]s, {{circa|lk=no|1015}}]]\n:''Main articles: [[Komnenian restoration|Byzantine Empire]], [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Grand Principality]], [[Principality of Arbanon]], [[Banate of Bosnia]], and [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]]''\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the height and decline of the Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] and emergence of [[Cumania]]. Later, the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century had great impact on the east of [[Europe]], as many countries of the region were invaded, pillaged, conquered and/or vassalized.\n\nDuring the first half of this period ({{circa|lk=no|1025}}{{mdash}}1185) the [[Byzantine Empire]] dominated the [[Balkans]], and under the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenian]] emperors there was a revival of prosperity and urbanization; however, their domination of [[Southeastern Europe]] came to an end with a successful [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|Vlach-Bulgarian rebellion in 1185]], and henceforth the region was divided between the Byzantines in Greece, some parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Thrace]], the Bulgarians in [[Moesia]] and most of Thrace and Macedonia, and the [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbs]] to the northwest. Eastern and Western churches had formally split in the 11th century, and despite occasional periods of co-operation during the 12th century, in 1204 the [[Fourth Crusade]] treacherously captured [[Constantinople]]. This severely damaged the Byzantines, and their power was ultimately weakened by the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuks]] and the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14\u201315th century. The power of the [[Latin Empire]], however, was short lived after the Crusader army was routed by [[list of Bulgarian monarchs|Bulgarian Emperor]] [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)]].\n\n===Climate and agriculture===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Highmiddleagesplow.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A farmer using [[ox]]en to plow a field]] -->\n\nThe [[Medieval Warm Period]], the period from 10th century to about the 14th century in Europe, was a relatively warm and gentle interval ended by the generally colder [[Little Ice Age]]. Farmers grew [[wheat]] well north into Scandinavia, and [[wine]] grapes in northern England, although the maximum expansion of vineyards appears to occur within the Little Ice Age period. During this time, a high demand for wine and steady volume of alcohol consumption inspired a viticulture revolution of progress.<ref>Jellinek, E. M. 1976. \"Drinkers and Alcoholics in Ancient Rome.\" Edited by Carole D. Yawney andRobert E. Popham. ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' 37 (11): 1718\u20131740.</ref> This protection from [[famine]] allowed Europe's population to increase, despite the famine in 1315 that killed 1.5 million people. This increased population contributed to the founding of new towns and an increase in industrial and economic activity during the period. They also established trade and a comprehensive production of alcohol. Food production also increased during this time as new ways of farming were introduced, including the use of a heavier plow, horses instead of oxen, and a three-field system that allowed the cultivation of a greater variety of crops than the earlier two-field system\u2014notably [[legume]]s, the growth of which prevented the depletion of important nitrogen from the soil.\n\n===The rise of chivalry===\nHousehold heavy cavalry ([[knight]]s) became common in the 11th century across Europe, and [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] were invented. Although the heavy capital investment in horse and armor was a barrier to entry, knighthood became known as a way for serfs to earn their freedom.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the 12th century, the [[Cluny]] monks promoted ethical warfare and inspired the formation of [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]], such as the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]]. Inherited titles of nobility were established during this period. In 13th-century Germany, knighthood became another [[inheritance|inheritable]] title, although one of the less prestigious, and the trend spread to other countries.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Limestone sculpture of Aaron.jpg|thumb|A limestone statue depicting [[Aaron]], brother of Moses in the Old Testament, from the Cathedral of [[Noyon]], {{circa|lk=no|1170}}]]\n\n===Christian Church===\nThe [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 formally separated the Christian church into two parts: [[Roman Catholicism]] in Western Europe and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] in the east. It occurred when [[Pope Leo IX]] and [[Michael Cerularius|Patriarch Michael I]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] each other, mainly over disputes as to the use of unleavened bread in the liturgy and fasting days, existence of papal authority over the four Eastern [[patriarch]]s, as well as disagreement over the [[filioque]].\n\n===Crusades===\n{{Main|Crusades}}\nThe Crusades occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. They were conducted under papal authority with the intent of reestablishing Christian rule in ''The Holy Land'' by taking the area from the Muslim [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The Fatimids had captured Palestine in AD 970, lost it to the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073 and recaptured it in 1098, just before they lost it again in 1099 as a result of the [[First Crusade]].\n\n====Military orders====\nIn the context of the crusades, monastic [[Military order (society)|military orders]] were founded that would become the template for the late medieval [[chivalric order]]s.\n\nThe [[Knights Templar]] were a Christian military order founded after the [[First Crusade]] to help protect Christian pilgrims from hostile locals and highway bandits. The order was deeply involved in banking, and in 1307 [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] (Philippine le Bel) had the entire order arrested in France and dismantled on charges of heresy.\n\nThe [[Knights Hospitaller]] were originally a [[Christianity|Christian]] organization founded in [[Jerusalem]] in 1080 to provide care for poor, sick, or injured [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to the Holy Land. After Jerusalem was taken in the First Crusade, it became a [[religious order|religious]]/[[Military order (society)|military order]] that was charged with the care and defence of the Holy Lands. After the Holy Lands were eventually taken by Muslim forces, it moved its operations to [[Rhodes]], and later [[Malta]].\n\nThe [[Teutonic Knights]] were a German religious order formed in 1190, in the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], to both aid Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Lands and to operate hospitals for the sick and injured in [[Outremer]]. After Muslim forces captured the Holy Lands, the order moved to [[Transylvania]] in 1211 and later, after being expelled, invaded pagan [[Prussia]] with the intention of Christianizing the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region. Yet, before and after the Order's main pagan opponent, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted]] to Christianity, the Order had already attacked other Christian nations such as [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]]. The Teutonic Knights' power hold, which became considerable, was broken in 1410, at the [[Battle of Grunwald]], where the Order suffered a devastating defeat against a joint Polish-Lithuanian army. After Grunwald, the Order declined in power until 1809 when it was officially dissolved.  There were ten crusades in total.\n\n===Scholasticism===\n{{main|Scholasticism}}\n[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An Arabic illustration of Aristotle teaching a student, {{circa|1220}}. Aristotle's works are the subject of extensive commentaries by [[Averroes]].]]\nThe new [[Christianity|Christian]] method of learning was influenced by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033\u20131109) from the rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]], at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and Muslim Philosophy ([[Maimonides]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]) and then through [[Aristotle]]'s own works brought back from [[Byzantine]] and Muslim libraries; and those whom he influenced, most notably [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Bonaventure]] and [[Peter Abelard|Ab\u00e9lard]]. Many scholastics believed in [[empiricism]] and supporting Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study, reason, and logic. They opposed [[Christian mysticism]], and the Platonist-Augustinian belief that the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind]] is an immaterial substance. The most famous of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] was [[Thomas Aquinas]] (later declared a \"[[Doctor of the Church]]\"), who led the move away from the [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] and towards Aristotelianism. Aquinas developed a [[philosophy of mind]] by writing that the [[mind]] was at birth a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (\"blank slate\") that was given the ability to think and recognize forms or ideas through a divine spark. Other notable scholastics included [[Averroes|Muhammad Averroes]], [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]], Ab\u00e9lard, [[Peter Lombard]], and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]]. One of the main questions during this time was the [[problem of universals]]. Prominent opponents of various aspects of the scholastic mainstream included [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Damian]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and the [[Victorines]]. {{Ref|Scholasticism}}\n\n===Golden age of monasticism===\n* The late 11th century/early-mid 12th century was the height of the golden age of [[Christian monasticism]] (8th-12th centuries).\n** [[Benedictine Order]] \u2013 black-robed monks\n** [[Cistercian Order]] \u2013 white-robed monks\n*** [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]\n\n===Mendicant orders===\n* The 13th century saw the rise of the [[Mendicant order]]s such as the:\n** [[Franciscan]]s (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209\n** [[Carmelite]]s (Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206\u20131214\n** [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215\n** [[Augustinians]] (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1256\n\n===Heretical movements===\nChristian [[Heresy|heresies]] existed in Europe before the 11th century but only in small numbers and of local character: in most cases, a rogue priest, or a village returning to pagan traditions. Beginning in the 11th century, however mass-movement heresies appeared. The roots of this can be partially sought in the rise of urban cities, free merchants, and a new money-based economy. The rural values of monasticism held little appeal to urban people who began to form sects more in tune with urban culture. The first large-scale heretical movements in Western Europe originated in the newly urbanized areas such as southern France and northern Italy and were probably influenced by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] and other [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist movements]]. These heresies were on a scale the Catholic Church had never seen before; the response was one of elimination for some (such as the [[Cathars]]), and acceptance and integration of others (such as the veneration of [[Francis of Assisi]], the son of an urban merchant who renounced money).\n\n====Cathars====\n[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209]]\n\n{{main|Catharism}}\n\n'''Catharism''' was a movement with [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] elements that originated around the middle of the 10th century, branded by the contemporary [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. It existed throughout much of [[Western Europe]], but its origination was in [[Languedoc]] and surrounding areas in southern France.\n\nThe name ''Cathar'' stems from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''katharos'', \"pure\". One of the first recorded uses is [[Eckebert|Eckbert von Sch\u00f6nau]] who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: \"Hos nostra Germania catharos appellat.\"\n\nThe Cathars are also called '''Albigensians'''. This name originates from the end of the 12th century, and was used by the chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil]] of Vigeois in 1181. The name refers to the southern town of [[Albi]] (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at [[Toulouse]] and in the neighbouring districts.\n\nThe [[Catharism|Albigensians]] were strong in southern France, northern Italy, and the southwestern [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] were strong in the [[Balkans]], and became the [[Bosnian Church|official religion supported by the Bosnian kings]].\n* [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualists]] believed that historical events were the result of struggle between a good force and an evil force and that evil ruled the world, though it could be controlled or defeated through [[asceticism]] and good works.\n* [[Albigensian Crusade]], [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], [[Monts\u00e9gur]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Qu\u00e9ribus]]\n\n====Waldensians====\n[[Peter Waldo]] of [[Lyon]] was a wealthy merchant who gave up his riches around 1175 after a religious experience and became a preacher. He founded the [[Waldensians]] which became a Christian sect believing that all religious practices should have scriptural basis. Waldo was denied the right to preach his sermons by the Third Lateran Council in 1179, which he did not obey and continued to speak freely until he was excommunicated in 1184. Waldo was critical of the Christian clergy saying they did not live according to the word. He rejected the practice of selling indulgences, as well as the common saint cult practices of the day.\n\nWaldensians are considered a forerunner to the [[Protestant Reformation]], and they melted into [[Protestantism]] with the outbreak of the Reformation and became a part of the wider [[Reformed tradition]] after the views of [[John Calvin]] and his theological successors in [[Geneva]] proved very similar to their own theological thought. Waldensian churches still exist, located on several continents.\n\n==Trade and commerce==\nIn Northern Europe, the [[Hanseatic League]], a federation of free cities to advance trade by sea, was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of [[L\u00fcbeck]], which would later dominate the League, in 1158\u20131159. Many northern cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] became hanseatic cities, including [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], [[Bremen]], [[Hanover]] and Berlin. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, [[Bruges]] and the Polish city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig), as well as K\u00f6nigsberg, capital of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights.  In [[Bergen]], Norway and [[Veliky Novgorod]], Russia the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonising Europe beyond the Empire, into [[Prussia]] and [[Silesia]].\n\nIn the late 13th century, a [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer named [[Marco Polo]] became one of the first Europeans to travel the [[Silk Road]] to China. Westerners became more aware of the Far East when Polo documented his travels in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]''. He was followed by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as [[William of Rubruck]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], [[Andr\u00e9 de Longjumeau]], [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni de' Marignolli]], [[John of Montecorvino|Giovanni di Monte Corvino]], and other travellers such as [[Niccol\u00f2 de' Conti]].\n\n==Science==\n{{main|Science in the Middle Ages|Medieval medicine}}\n{{further|List of medieval European scientists}}\n[[File:Culture of Europe in 1250.png|thumb|270px|A map of medieval universities and major monasteries with library in 1250]]\nPhilosophical and scientific teaching of the [[Early Middle Ages]] was based upon few copies and commentaries of ancient Greek texts that remained in Western Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Most of them were studied only in Latin as knowledge of Greek was very limited.\n\nThis scenario changed during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. The intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]]. The increased contact with the Islamic world in [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily]] during the [[Reconquista]], and the Byzantine world and Muslim [[Levant]] during the [[Crusades]], allowed Europeans access to scientific Arabic and Greek texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], and [[Averroes]]. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for [[science|scientific]] communities.\n[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|frame|right|Detail of a portrait of Hugh de Provence (wearing [[spectacles]]), painted by [[Tomasso da Modena]] in 1352]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors,<ref>Franklin, J., [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/renaissance.html \"The Renaissance myth\"], Quadrant 26 (11) (Nov, 1982), 51-60. (Retrieved on-line at 06-07-2007)</ref> allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural science contained in these texts began to be extended by notable [[scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern [[scientific method]] can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.\n\n===Technology===\n{{main|Medieval technology|Artes Mechanicae}}\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th century in Europe there was a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. In less than a century there were more inventions developed and applied usefully than in the previous thousand years of human history all over the globe. The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption or invention of [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s, [[printing]] (though not yet with movable type), [[gunpowder]], the [[astrolabe]], [[glasses]], [[scissors]] of the modern shape, a better [[clock]], and greatly improved ships. The latter two advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Discovery]]. These inventions were influenced by foreign culture and society.\n\n[[Alfred W. Crosby]] described some of this technological revolution in ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.\n[[File:WorldShips1460.jpg|thumb|Ships of the world in 1460, according to the [[Fra Mauro map]].]]\n* The earliest written record of a [[windmill]] is from [[Yorkshire]], England, dated 1185.\n* [[Paper]] manufacture began in Italy around 1270.\n* The [[spinning wheel]] was brought to Europe (probably from India) in the 13th century.\n* The [[magnetic compass]] aided navigation, first reaching Europe some time in the late 12th century.\n* Eye [[glasses]] were invented in Italy in the late 1280s.\n* The [[astrolabe]] returned to Europe via Islamic Spain.\n* [[Fibonacci]] introduces [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] to Europe with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202.\n* The West's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted [[rudder]] can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180.\n\n==Arts==\n\n===Visual arts===\n[[File:Konstantin i Irina.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Fresco from the [[Boyana Church]] depicting Emperor [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh Asen]]. The murals are among the finest achievements of the [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] culture in the 13th century.]]\n{{main|Medieval art}}\n\nArt in the High Middle Ages includes these important movements:\n* [[Anglo-Saxon art]] was influential on the British Isles until the Norman Invasion of 1066\n* [[Romanesque art]] continued traditions from the Classical world (not to be confused with [[Romanesque architecture]])\n* [[Gothic art]] developed a distinct Germanic flavor (not to be confused with [[Gothic architecture]]).\n* [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] begins when [[Muhammad of Ghor]] made [[Delhi]] a Muslim capital\n* [[Byzantine art]] continued earlier Byzantine traditions, influencing much of Eastern Europe.\n* [[Illuminated manuscripts]] gained prominence both in the Catholic and Orthodox churches\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Paris Notre-Dame cathedral interior nave east 01b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Interior of [[N\u00f4tre Dame de Paris]]]]\n{{main|Gothic architecture}}\n\nGothic architecture superseded the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by combining [[flying buttress]]es, gothic (or pointed) [[arch]]es and [[ribbed vault]]s. It was influenced by the spiritual background of the time, being religious in essence: thin horizontal lines and grates made the building strive towards the sky. Architecture was made to appear light and weightless, as opposed to the dark and bulky forms of the previous [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] taught that light was an expression of God. Architectural techniques were adapted and developed to build churches that reflected this teaching. Colorful [[glass window]]s enhanced the spirit of lightness. As color was much rarer at medieval times than today, it can be assumed that these virtuoso works of art had an awe-inspiring impact on the common man from the street. High-rising intricate ribbed, and later [[fan vault]]ings demonstrated movement toward heaven. Veneration of God was also expressed by the relatively large size of these buildings. A gothic cathedral therefore not only invited the visitors to elevate themselves spiritually, it was also meant to demonstrate the greatness of God. The [[floor plan]] of a gothic cathedral corresponded to the rules of scholasticism: According to Erwin Panofsky's ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', the plan was divided into sections and uniform subsections. These characteristics are exhibited by the most famous sacral building of the time: [[Notre Dame de Paris]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Medieval literature}}\n[[File:Apostle John and Marcion of Sinope, from JPM LIbrary MS 748, 11th c.jpg|thumb|[[John the Apostle]] and [[Marcion of Sinope]] in an Italian [[illuminated manuscript]], painting on [[vellum]], 11th century]]\nA variety of cultures influenced the literature of the High Middle Ages, one of the strongest among them being Christianity. The connection to Christianity was greatest in [[Latin literature]], which influenced the [[vernacular]] languages in the [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]] of the [[Matter of Rome]]. Other [[literary]] cycles, or interrelated groups of stories, included the [[Matter of France]] (stories about [[Charlemagne]] and his court), the [[Acritic songs]] dealing with the chivalry of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium's]] frontiersmen, and perhaps the best known cycle, the [[Matter of Britain]], which featured tales about [[King Arthur]], his court, and related stories from [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and Ireland. An anonymous German poet tried to bring the Germanic myths from the [[Migration Period]] to the level of the French and British epics, producing the [[Nibelungenlied]]. There was also a quantity of poetry and historical writings which were written during this period, such as ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].\n\nDespite political decline during the late 12th and much of the 13th centuries, the Byzantine scholarly tradition remained particularly fruitful over the time period. One of the most prominent philosophers of the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]], reinvigorated [[Neoplatonism]] on Christian foundations and bolstered the study of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient philosophical texts]], along with contributing to history, grammar, and rhetorics. His pupil and successor at the head of Philosophy at the [[University of Constantinople]] [[John Italus|Ioannes Italos]] continued the Platonic line in Byzantine thought and was criticized by the Church for holding opinions it considered heretical, such as the doctrine of [[Reincarnation|transmigration]]. Two Orthodox theologians important in the dialogue between the eastern and western churches were [[Nikephoros Blemmydes]] and [[Maximus Planudes]]. Byzantine historical tradition also flourished with the works of the brothers [[Niketas Choniates|Niketas]] and [[Michael Choniates]] in the beginning of the 13th century and [[George Akropolites]] a generation later. Dating from 12th century Byzantine Empire is also [[Timarion]], an Orthodox Christian anticipation of [[Divine Comedy]]. Around the same time the so-called [[Byzantine novel]] rose in popularity with its synthesis of ancient pagan and contemporaneous Christian themes.\n\nAt the same time southern France gave birth to [[Occitan literature]], which is best known for [[troubadour]]s who sang of [[courtly love]]. It included elements from Latin literature and Arab-influenced Spain and North Africa. Later its influence spread to several cultures in Western Europe, notably in Portugal and the Minnes\u00e4nger in Germany. Proven\u00e7al literature also reached Sicily and Northern Italy laying the foundation of the [[Dolce Stil Nuovo|\"sweet new style\"]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and later [[Petrarch|Petrarca]]. Indeed, the most important poem of the [[Late Middle Ages]], the allegorical ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' is to a large degree a product of both the [[Summa Theologica|theology of Thomas Aquinas]] and the largely secular Occitan literature.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Medieval music}}\n[[File:Vihuela de arco y vihuela de p\u00e9\u00f1ola en las Cantigas.jpg|thumb|Musicians playing the Spanish ''[[vihuela]]'', one with a bow, the other plucked by hand, in the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], 13th century]]\n[[File:Organistrum Orense 200708.jpg|thumb|Men playing the [[organistrum]], from the [[Ourense Cathedral]], Spain, 12th century]]\nThe surviving music of the High Middle Ages is primarily religious in nature, since [[music notation]] developed in religious institutions, and the application of notation to secular music was a later development. Early in the period, [[Gregorian chant]] was the dominant form of church music; other forms, beginning with [[organum]], and later including [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]], and the [[motet]], developed using the chant as source material.\n\nDuring the 11th century, [[Guido of Arezzo]] was one of the first to develop musical notation, which made it easier for singers to remember Gregorian chants.\n\nIt was during the 12th and 13th centuries that Gregorian plainchant gave birth to polyphony, which appeared in the works of French [[Notre Dame School]] ([[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]]). Later it evolved into the ''[[ars nova]]'' ([[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]]) and the musical genres of late Middle Ages. An important composer during the 12th century was the [[nun]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]].\n\nThe most significant secular movement was that of the [[troubadour]]s, who arose in [[Occitania]] (Southern France) in the late 11th century. The troubadours were often [[itinerant entertainer|itinerant]], came from all classes of society, and wrote songs on a variety of topics, though with a particular focus on [[courtly love]]. Their style went on to influence the [[trouv\u00e8re]]s of northern France, the [[minnesinger]]s of Germany, and the composers of secular [[music of the Trecento]] in northern Italy.\n\n===Theatre===\n{{Main|Medieval theatre}}\nEconomic and political changes in the High Middle Ages led to the formation of  [[guilds]] and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the [[Last Supper]].<ref>''A History of English literature for Students'', by Robert Huntington Fletcher, 1916: pp. 85\u201388</ref>  In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages.

1300. The High [[Middle Ages]] were preceded by the [[Early Middle Ages]] and were followed by the [[Late Middle Ages]], which ended around 1500 (by [[historiography|historiographical]] convention).<ref>John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150-1309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]</ref>\n\nKey historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the [[medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], including the first developments of [[rural exodus]] and of [[urbanization]]. By 1250, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|series of calamities]], most notably the [[Black Death]], but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.\n\nFrom around 780,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Europe saw the last of the [[barbarian invasions]]<ref>''Reiterv\u00f6lker im Fr\u00fchmittelalter.'' Bodo, Anke et.al.

The [[Medieval universities|first universities]] started operating in Bologna, Paris, Oxford, Salamanca, Cambridge and Modena. The [[Viking]]s settled in the British Isles, France and elsewhere, and Norse Christian kingdoms started developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Magyars]] ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, a Christian [[Kingdom of Hungary]] had become a recognized state in [[Central Europe]] that was forming alliances with regional powers. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasions]] in the 13th century, major nomadic incursions ceased. The powerful [[Byzantine Empire]] of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian]] and [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenos]] dynasties gradually gave way to the resurrected [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbia]] and [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and to a successor [[Latin Empire|crusader state]] (1204 to 1261), which countered the continuous threat of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] in [[Asia Minor]]. Although the Empire was reestablished in 1261 with the recapture of Constantinople, it was no longer a major power and would continue to falter through the 14th century, with remnants lasting until the mid 15th century.  \n\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began a more intensive settlement, targeting \"new\" lands, some of which areas had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the \"great clearances\",<ref>\nSee for example: \n{{cite book\n| last1 = Aberth\n| first1 = John\n| chapter = The early medieval woodland\n| title = An Environmental History of the Middle Ages: The Crucible of Nature\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7a28UnCLPIIC\n| location = Abingdon\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = 87\n| isbn = 9780415779456\n| access-date = 2017-08-17\n| quote = The French historian of the early medieval forest, Charles Higounet, produced a map in the 1960s, which has been much reproduced since, that purports to show the distribution of the forest cover in Europe on the eve of the so-called 'great clearances' (''les grands d\u00e9frichements'') between 1000 and 1300.\n}}\n</ref> Europeans cleared and cultivated some of the vast forests and marshes that lay across much of the continent. At the same time, settlers moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers beyond the [[Elbe River]], which tripled the size of Germany in the process. The [[Catholic Church]], which reached the peak of its political power around then, called armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the Seljuk Turks. The crusaders occupied the [[Holy Land]] and founded the [[Crusader States]] in the [[Levant]]. Other wars led to the [[Northern Crusades]]. The Christian kingdoms [[Reconquista|took much of the Iberian Peninsula]] from [[Muslim]] control, and the [[Normans]] conquered southern Italy, all part of the major population increases and the resettlement patterns of the era.\n\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The age also saw the rise of [[ethnocentrism]], which evolved later into modern [[civic nationalism]]s in most of Europe, the ascent of the great Italian [[city-state]]s and the rise and fall of the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]] of [[Al-Andalus]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]], at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and [[Islamic Philosophy]],{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} led [[Maimonides]], [[Avicenna]], [[Averroes|Muhammad Averroes]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers of the period to expand [[Scholasticism]], a combination of Judeo-Islamic and Catholic ideologies with the ancient philosophy. For much of this period, [[Constantinople]] remained Europe's most populous city, and Byzantine art reached a [[Byzantine civilization in the twelfth century|peak in the 12th century]]. In architecture, many of the most notable [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedrals]] were built or completed around this period.\n\nThe [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]] began at the start of the 14th century and marked the end of the period.\n\n==Historical events and politics==\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting the [[Battle of Hastings]] during the Norman invasion of England]]\n\n===Great Britain and Ireland===\n{{Main|England in the Middle Ages|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|History of Gwynedd during the High Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Aleanor of Aqutaine and Henri II.jpg|thumb|The painted effigies of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry II of England]] from the [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in [[Anjou]], France, which no longer houses their remains]]\nIn England, the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 resulted in a kingdom ruled by a [[French language|Francophone]] nobility. The [[Normans]] invaded Ireland by force in 1169 and soon established themselves throughout most of the country, although their stronghold was the southeast. Likewise, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were subdued to vassalage at about the same time, though Scotland later asserted its independence and Wales remained largely under the rule of independent native princes until the death of [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd|Llywelyn ap Gruffydd]] in 1282.<ref>Davies, Rees (2001-05-01). \"Wales: A Culture Preserved\". bbc.co.uk/history. p. 3. Retrieved 2008-05-06.</ref> The [[Exchequer]] was founded in the 12th century under [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], and the first [[Parliament of England|parliaments]] were convened. In 1215, after the loss of [[Normandy]], [[John of England|King John]] signed the [[Magna Carta]] into law, which limited the power of [[List of monarchs of England|English monarchs]].\n\n===Spain, Portugal, and Italy===\n{{main|Spain in the Middle Ages|Italy in the Middle Ages}}\n\nMuch of the [[Iberian peninsula]] had been occupied by the [[Moors]] after 711, although the northernmost portion was divided between several Christian states. In the 11th century, and again in the thirteenth, the Christian kingdoms of the north gradually drove the Muslims from central and most of southern Iberia.\n\nIn Italy, independent city states grew affluent on eastern maritime trade. These were in particular the [[thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] of [[Pisa]], [[Amalfi]], [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].\n\n===Scandinavia===\n{{main|History of Denmark#Christianity, expansion and the establishment of the Kingdom of Denmark|History of Norway#The Viking kings|Early Swedish history}}\n\nFrom the mid-tenth to the mid-11th centuries, the Scandinavian kingdoms were unified and Christianized, resulting in an end of [[Viking]] raids, and greater involvement in European politics. King [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] of Denmark ruled over both England and Norway. After Cnut's death in 1035, England and Norway were lost, and with the defeat of [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Valdemar II]] in 1227, Danish predominance in the region came to an end. Meanwhile, Norway extended its Atlantic possessions, ranging from [[Greenland]] to the [[Isle of Man]], while Sweden, under [[Birger Jarl]], built up a power-base in the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, the Norwegian influence started to decline already in the same period, marked by the [[Treaty of Perth]] of 1266. Also, [[Civil war era in Norway|civil wars raged in Norway]] between 1130 and 1240.\n\n===France and Germany===\n{{main|France in the Middle Ages|Germany in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:France 1154 Eng.jpg|thumb|200px|France in the 12th century. The [[Angevin Empire|King of England]] held all the red territories.]]\nBy the time of the High Middle Ages, the [[Carolingian Empire]] had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called France and Germany, although not with their modern boundaries. Germany was under the banner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which reached its high-water mark of unity and political power.\n\n===Georgia===\n{{Main|Georgian Golden Age}}\nDuring the successful reign of King [[David IV of Georgia]] (1089\u20131125), [[Kingdom of Georgia]] grew in strength and expelled the [[Seljuk Empire]] from its lands. David's decisive victory in the [[Battle of Didgori]] (1121) against the Seljuk Turks, as a result of which Georgia recaptured its lost capital [[Tbilisi]], marked the beginning of the [[Georgian Golden Age]]. David's granddaughter [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] continued the upward rise, successfully neutralizing internal opposition and embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by further decline of the hostile [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. Relying on a powerful military \u00e9lite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated vast lands spanning from present-day southern [[Russian Federation|Russia]] on the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Georgia remained a leading regional power until its collapse under the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.\n\n===Hungary===\n{{main|Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:SztIstvan 5.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.8|King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]].]]\nIn the High Middle Ages, the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (founded in 1000), became one of the most powerful medieval states in central Europe and Western Europe. King Saint [[Stephen I of Hungary]] introduced Christianity to the region; he was remembered by the contemporary chroniclers as a very religious monarch, with wide knowledge in Latin grammar, strict with his own people but kind to the foreigners. He eradicated the remnants of the tribal organisation in the Kingdom and forced the people to sedentarize and adopt the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion, ethics, way of life and founded the Hungarian medieval state, organising it politically in counties using the Germanic system as a model.\n\nThe following monarchs usually kept a close relationship with Rome like Saint [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]], and a tolerant attitude with the [[paganism|pagans]] that escaped to the Kingdom searching for sanctuary (for example [[Cumans]] in the 13th century), which eventually created certain discomfort for some [[Pope]]s. With entering in [[Personal union]] with the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)#Controversies|Kingdom of Croatia]] and annexation of other small states, Hungary became a small empire that extended its control over the [[Balkans]] and all the [[Carpathian]] region. The [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] royal house was the one that gave the most saints to the Catholic Church during medieval times.\n\n===Lithuania===\n{{main|Grand Duchy of Lithuania}}\nDuring the High Middle Ages Lithuania emerged as a [[Kingdom of Lithuania]]. After the assassination of its first Christian king [[Mindaugas]] Lithuania was known as [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. Unconquered during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]], Lithuania itself rapidly expanded to the East due to conquests and became one of the largest states in Europe.\n\n===Poland===\n{{main|History of Poland in the Middle Ages}}\nDuring the High Middle Ages [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland emerged as a kingdom]]. It decided to bond itself with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], confirmed by the [[Union of Krewo]] and later treaties, leading to a personal union in 1569.\n\n===Southeastern Europe===\n[[File:Khazarfall1.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Pontic steppe]]s, {{circa|lk=no|1015}}]]\n:''Main articles: [[Komnenian restoration|Byzantine Empire]], [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], [[Serbian Grand Principality]], [[Principality of Arbanon]], [[Banate of Bosnia]], and [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|Kingdom of Croatia]]''\n\nThe High Middle Ages saw the height and decline of the Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] and emergence of [[Cumania]]. Later, the [[Mongol invasions|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century had great impact on the east of [[Europe]], as many countries of the region were invaded, pillaged, conquered and/or vassalized.\n\nDuring the first half of this period ({{circa|lk=no|1025}}{{mdash}}1185) the [[Byzantine Empire]] dominated the [[Balkans]], and under the [[Byzantine Empire under the Komnenos dynasty|Komnenian]] emperors there was a revival of prosperity and urbanization; however, their domination of [[Southeastern Europe]] came to an end with a successful [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|Vlach-Bulgarian rebellion in 1185]], and henceforth the region was divided between the Byzantines in Greece, some parts of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Thrace]], the Bulgarians in [[Moesia]] and most of Thrace and Macedonia, and the [[Serbian Grand Principality|Serbs]] to the northwest. Eastern and Western churches had formally split in the 11th century, and despite occasional periods of co-operation during the 12th century, in 1204 the [[Fourth Crusade]] treacherously captured [[Constantinople]]. This severely damaged the Byzantines, and their power was ultimately weakened by the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuks]] and the rising [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 14\u201315th century. The power of the [[Latin Empire]], however, was short lived after the Crusader army was routed by [[list of Bulgarian monarchs|Bulgarian Emperor]] [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria|Kaloyan]] in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)]].\n\n===Climate and agriculture===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Highmiddleagesplow.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A farmer using [[ox]]en to plow a field]] -->\n\nThe [[Medieval Warm Period]], the period from 10th century to about the 14th century in Europe, was a relatively warm and gentle interval ended by the generally colder [[Little Ice Age]]. Farmers grew [[wheat]] well north into Scandinavia, and [[wine]] grapes in northern England, although the maximum expansion of vineyards appears to occur within the Little Ice Age period. During this time, a high demand for wine and steady volume of alcohol consumption inspired a viticulture revolution of progress.<ref>Jellinek, E. M. 1976. \"Drinkers and Alcoholics in Ancient Rome.\" Edited by Carole D. Yawney andRobert E. Popham. ''Journal of Studies on Alcohol'' 37 (11): 1718\u20131740.</ref> This protection from [[famine]] allowed Europe's population to increase, despite the famine in 1315 that killed 1.5 million people. This increased population contributed to the founding of new towns and an increase in industrial and economic activity during the period. They also established trade and a comprehensive production of alcohol. Food production also increased during this time as new ways of farming were introduced, including the use of a heavier plow, horses instead of oxen, and a three-field system that allowed the cultivation of a greater variety of crops than the earlier two-field system\u2014notably [[legume]]s, the growth of which prevented the depletion of important nitrogen from the soil.\n\n===The rise of chivalry===\nHousehold heavy cavalry ([[knight]]s) became common in the 11th century across Europe, and [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] were invented. Although the heavy capital investment in horse and armor was a barrier to entry, knighthood became known as a way for serfs to earn their freedom.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} In the 12th century, the [[Cluny]] monks promoted ethical warfare and inspired the formation of [[order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]], such as the [[Knights Templar|Templar Knights]]. Inherited titles of nobility were established during this period. In 13th-century Germany, knighthood became another [[inheritance|inheritable]] title, although one of the less prestigious, and the trend spread to other countries.\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Limestone sculpture of Aaron.jpg|thumb|A limestone statue depicting [[Aaron]], brother of Moses in the Old Testament, from the Cathedral of [[Noyon]], {{circa|lk=no|1170}}]]\n\n===Christian Church===\nThe [[East\u2013West Schism]] of 1054 formally separated the Christian church into two parts: [[Roman Catholicism]] in Western Europe and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] in the east. It occurred when [[Pope Leo IX]] and [[Michael Cerularius|Patriarch Michael I]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] each other, mainly over disputes as to the use of unleavened bread in the liturgy and fasting days, existence of papal authority over the four Eastern [[patriarch]]s, as well as disagreement over the [[filioque]].\n\n===Crusades===\n{{Main|Crusades}}\nThe Crusades occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. They were conducted under papal authority with the intent of reestablishing Christian rule in ''The Holy Land'' by taking the area from the Muslim [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. The Fatimids had captured Palestine in AD 970, lost it to the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073 and recaptured it in 1098, just before they lost it again in 1099 as a result of the [[First Crusade]].\n\n====Military orders====\nIn the context of the crusades, monastic [[Military order (society)|military orders]] were founded that would become the template for the late medieval [[chivalric order]]s.\n\nThe [[Knights Templar]] were a Christian military order founded after the [[First Crusade]] to help protect Christian pilgrims from hostile locals and highway bandits. The order was deeply involved in banking, and in 1307 [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]] (Philippine le Bel) had the entire order arrested in France and dismantled on charges of heresy.\n\nThe [[Knights Hospitaller]] were originally a [[Christianity|Christian]] organization founded in [[Jerusalem]] in 1080 to provide care for poor, sick, or injured [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to the Holy Land. After Jerusalem was taken in the First Crusade, it became a [[religious order|religious]]/[[Military order (society)|military order]] that was charged with the care and defence of the Holy Lands. After the Holy Lands were eventually taken by Muslim forces, it moved its operations to [[Rhodes]], and later [[Malta]].\n\nThe [[Teutonic Knights]] were a German religious order formed in 1190, in the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], to both aid Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Lands and to operate hospitals for the sick and injured in [[Outremer]]. After Muslim forces captured the Holy Lands, the order moved to [[Transylvania]] in 1211 and later, after being expelled, invaded pagan [[Prussia]] with the intention of Christianizing the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region. Yet, before and after the Order's main pagan opponent, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted]] to Christianity, the Order had already attacked other Christian nations such as [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Poland]]. The Teutonic Knights' power hold, which became considerable, was broken in 1410, at the [[Battle of Grunwald]], where the Order suffered a devastating defeat against a joint Polish-Lithuanian army. After Grunwald, the Order declined in power until 1809 when it was officially dissolved.  There were ten crusades in total.\n\n===Scholasticism===\n{{main|Scholasticism}}\n[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An Arabic illustration of Aristotle teaching a student, {{circa|1220}}. Aristotle's works are the subject of extensive commentaries by [[Averroes]].]]\nThe new [[Christianity|Christian]] method of learning was influenced by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033\u20131109) from the rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]], at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and Muslim Philosophy ([[Maimonides]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]) and then through [[Aristotle]]'s own works brought back from [[Byzantine]] and Muslim libraries; and those whom he influenced, most notably [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Bonaventure]] and [[Peter Abelard|Ab\u00e9lard]]. Many scholastics believed in [[empiricism]] and supporting Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study, reason, and logic. They opposed [[Christian mysticism]], and the Platonist-Augustinian belief that the [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|mind]] is an immaterial substance. The most famous of the [[Scholasticism|scholastics]] was [[Thomas Aquinas]] (later declared a \"[[Doctor of the Church]]\"), who led the move away from the [[Platonism|Platonic]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustinian]] and towards Aristotelianism. Aquinas developed a [[philosophy of mind]] by writing that the [[mind]] was at birth a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (\"blank slate\") that was given the ability to think and recognize forms or ideas through a divine spark. Other notable scholastics included [[Averroes|Muhammad Averroes]], [[Roscellinus|Roscelin]], Ab\u00e9lard, [[Peter Lombard]], and [[Francisco Su\u00e1rez]]. One of the main questions during this time was the [[problem of universals]]. Prominent opponents of various aspects of the scholastic mainstream included [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Damian]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], and the [[Victorines]]. {{Ref|Scholasticism}}\n\n===Golden age of monasticism===\n* The late 11th century/early-mid 12th century was the height of the golden age of [[Christian monasticism]] (8th-12th centuries).\n** [[Benedictine Order]] \u2013 black-robed monks\n** [[Cistercian Order]] \u2013 white-robed monks\n*** [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]\n\n===Mendicant orders===\n* The 13th century saw the rise of the [[Mendicant order]]s such as the:\n** [[Franciscan]]s (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209\n** [[Carmelite]]s (Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206\u20131214\n** [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215\n** [[Augustinians]] (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1256\n\n===Heretical movements===\nChristian [[Heresy|heresies]] existed in Europe before the 11th century but only in small numbers and of local character: in most cases, a rogue priest, or a village returning to pagan traditions. Beginning in the 11th century, however mass-movement heresies appeared. The roots of this can be partially sought in the rise of urban cities, free merchants, and a new money-based economy. The rural values of monasticism held little appeal to urban people who began to form sects more in tune with urban culture. The first large-scale heretical movements in Western Europe originated in the newly urbanized areas such as southern France and northern Italy and were probably influenced by the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] and other [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist movements]]. These heresies were on a scale the Catholic Church had never seen before; the response was one of elimination for some (such as the [[Cathars]]), and acceptance and integration of others (such as the veneration of [[Francis of Assisi]], the son of an urban merchant who renounced money).\n\n====Cathars====\n[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Cathars being expelled from [[Carcassonne]] in 1209]]\n\n{{main|Catharism}}\n\n'''Catharism''' was a movement with [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] elements that originated around the middle of the 10th century, branded by the contemporary [[Roman Catholic Church]] as [[heresy|heretical]]. It existed throughout much of [[Western Europe]], but its origination was in [[Languedoc]] and surrounding areas in southern France.\n\nThe name ''Cathar'' stems from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''katharos'', \"pure\". One of the first recorded uses is [[Eckebert|Eckbert von Sch\u00f6nau]] who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: \"Hos nostra Germania catharos appellat.\"\n\nThe Cathars are also called '''Albigensians'''. This name originates from the end of the 12th century, and was used by the chronicler [[Geoffroy du Breuil]] of Vigeois in 1181. The name refers to the southern town of [[Albi]] (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at [[Toulouse]] and in the neighbouring districts.\n\nThe [[Catharism|Albigensians]] were strong in southern France, northern Italy, and the southwestern [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] were strong in the [[Balkans]], and became the [[Bosnian Church|official religion supported by the Bosnian kings]].\n* [[Dualistic cosmology|Dualists]] believed that historical events were the result of struggle between a good force and an evil force and that evil ruled the world, though it could be controlled or defeated through [[asceticism]] and good works.\n* [[Albigensian Crusade]], [[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], [[Monts\u00e9gur]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Qu\u00e9ribus]]\n\n====Waldensians====\n[[Peter Waldo]] of [[Lyon]] was a wealthy merchant who gave up his riches around 1175 after a religious experience and became a preacher. He founded the [[Waldensians]] which became a Christian sect believing that all religious practices should have scriptural basis. Waldo was denied the right to preach his sermons by the Third Lateran Council in 1179, which he did not obey and continued to speak freely until he was excommunicated in 1184. Waldo was critical of the Christian clergy saying they did not live according to the word. He rejected the practice of selling indulgences, as well as the common saint cult practices of the day.\n\nWaldensians are considered a forerunner to the [[Protestant Reformation]], and they melted into [[Protestantism]] with the outbreak of the Reformation and became a part of the wider [[Reformed tradition]] after the views of [[John Calvin]] and his theological successors in [[Geneva]] proved very similar to their own theological thought. Waldensian churches still exist, located on several continents.\n\n==Trade and commerce==\nIn Northern Europe, the [[Hanseatic League]], a federation of free cities to advance trade by sea, was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of [[L\u00fcbeck]], which would later dominate the League, in 1158\u20131159. Many northern cities of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] became hanseatic cities, including [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], [[Bremen]], [[Hanover]] and Berlin. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, [[Bruges]] and the Polish city of [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig), as well as K\u00f6nigsberg, capital of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights.  In [[Bergen]], Norway and [[Veliky Novgorod]], Russia the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonising Europe beyond the Empire, into [[Prussia]] and [[Silesia]].\n\nIn the late 13th century, a [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer named [[Marco Polo]] became one of the first Europeans to travel the [[Silk Road]] to China. Westerners became more aware of the Far East when Polo documented his travels in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]''. He was followed by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as [[William of Rubruck]], [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], [[Andr\u00e9 de Longjumeau]], [[Odoric of Pordenone]], [[Giovanni de' Marignolli]], [[John of Montecorvino|Giovanni di Monte Corvino]], and other travellers such as [[Niccol\u00f2 de' Conti]].\n\n==Science==\n{{main|Science in the Middle Ages|Medieval medicine}}\n{{further|List of medieval European scientists}}\n[[File:Culture of Europe in 1250.png|thumb|270px|A map of medieval universities and major monasteries with library in 1250]]\nPhilosophical and scientific teaching of the [[Early Middle Ages]] was based upon few copies and commentaries of ancient Greek texts that remained in Western Europe after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Most of them were studied only in Latin as knowledge of Greek was very limited.\n\nThis scenario changed during the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. The intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of [[Medieval university|medieval universities]]. The increased contact with the Islamic world in [[Al-Andalus|Spain]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicily]] during the [[Reconquista]], and the Byzantine world and Muslim [[Levant]] during the [[Crusades]], allowed Europeans access to scientific Arabic and Greek texts, including the works of [[Aristotle]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], and [[Averroes]]. The European universities aided materially in the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation and propagation of these texts]] and started a new infrastructure which was needed for [[science|scientific]] communities.\n[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|frame|right|Detail of a portrait of Hugh de Provence (wearing [[spectacles]]), painted by [[Tomasso da Modena]] in 1352]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 13th century there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors,<ref>Franklin, J., [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/renaissance.html \"The Renaissance myth\"], Quadrant 26 (11) (Nov, 1982), 51-60. (Retrieved on-line at 06-07-2007)</ref> allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural science contained in these texts began to be extended by notable [[scholastics]] such as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Precursors of the modern [[scientific method]] can be seen already in Grosseteste's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his ''[[Opus Majus]]''.\n\n===Technology===\n{{main|Medieval technology|Artes Mechanicae}}\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th century in Europe there was a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. In less than a century there were more inventions developed and applied usefully than in the previous thousand years of human history all over the globe. The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption or invention of [[windmill]]s, [[watermill]]s, [[printing]] (though not yet with movable type), [[gunpowder]], the [[astrolabe]], [[glasses]], [[scissors]] of the modern shape, a better [[clock]], and greatly improved ships. The latter two advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Discovery]]. These inventions were influenced by foreign culture and society.\n\n[[Alfred W. Crosby]] described some of this technological revolution in ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.\n[[File:WorldShips1460.jpg|thumb|Ships of the world in 1460, according to the [[Fra Mauro map]].]]\n* The earliest written record of a [[windmill]] is from [[Yorkshire]], England, dated 1185.\n* [[Paper]] manufacture began in Italy around 1270.\n* The [[spinning wheel]] was brought to Europe (probably from India) in the 13th century.\n* The [[magnetic compass]] aided navigation, first reaching Europe some time in the late 12th century.\n* Eye [[glasses]] were invented in Italy in the late 1280s.\n* The [[astrolabe]] returned to Europe via Islamic Spain.\n* [[Fibonacci]] introduces [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] to Europe with his book ''[[Liber Abaci]]'' in 1202.\n* The West's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted [[rudder]] can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180.\n\n==Arts==\n\n===Visual arts===\n[[File:Konstantin i Irina.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Fresco from the [[Boyana Church]] depicting Emperor [[Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria|Constantine Tikh Asen]]. The murals are among the finest achievements of the [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] culture in the 13th century.]]\n{{main|Medieval art}}\n\nArt in the High Middle Ages includes these important movements:\n* [[Anglo-Saxon art]] was influential on the British Isles until the Norman Invasion of 1066\n* [[Romanesque art]] continued traditions from the Classical world (not to be confused with [[Romanesque architecture]])\n* [[Gothic art]] developed a distinct Germanic flavor (not to be confused with [[Gothic architecture]]).\n* [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] begins when [[Muhammad of Ghor]] made [[Delhi]] a Muslim capital\n* [[Byzantine art]] continued earlier Byzantine traditions, influencing much of Eastern Europe.\n* [[Illuminated manuscripts]] gained prominence both in the Catholic and Orthodox churches\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Paris Notre-Dame cathedral interior nave east 01b.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Interior of [[N\u00f4tre Dame de Paris]]]]\n{{main|Gothic architecture}}\n\nGothic architecture superseded the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style by combining [[flying buttress]]es, gothic (or pointed) [[arch]]es and [[ribbed vault]]s. It was influenced by the spiritual background of the time, being religious in essence: thin horizontal lines and grates made the building strive towards the sky. Architecture was made to appear light and weightless, as opposed to the dark and bulky forms of the previous [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. [[Saint Augustine of Hippo]] taught that light was an expression of God. Architectural techniques were adapted and developed to build churches that reflected this teaching. Colorful [[glass window]]s enhanced the spirit of lightness. As color was much rarer at medieval times than today, it can be assumed that these virtuoso works of art had an awe-inspiring impact on the common man from the street. High-rising intricate ribbed, and later [[fan vault]]ings demonstrated movement toward heaven. Veneration of God was also expressed by the relatively large size of these buildings. A gothic cathedral therefore not only invited the visitors to elevate themselves spiritually, it was also meant to demonstrate the greatness of God. The [[floor plan]] of a gothic cathedral corresponded to the rules of scholasticism: According to Erwin Panofsky's ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'', the plan was divided into sections and uniform subsections. These characteristics are exhibited by the most famous sacral building of the time: [[Notre Dame de Paris]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Medieval literature}}\n[[File:Apostle John and Marcion of Sinope, from JPM LIbrary MS 748, 11th c.jpg|thumb|[[John the Apostle]] and [[Marcion of Sinope]] in an Italian [[illuminated manuscript]], painting on [[vellum]], 11th century]]\nA variety of cultures influenced the literature of the High Middle Ages, one of the strongest among them being Christianity. The connection to Christianity was greatest in [[Latin literature]], which influenced the [[vernacular]] languages in the [[Literature cycle|literary cycle]] of the [[Matter of Rome]]. Other [[literary]] cycles, or interrelated groups of stories, included the [[Matter of France]] (stories about [[Charlemagne]] and his court), the [[Acritic songs]] dealing with the chivalry of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium's]] frontiersmen, and perhaps the best known cycle, the [[Matter of Britain]], which featured tales about [[King Arthur]], his court, and related stories from [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and Ireland. An anonymous German poet tried to bring the Germanic myths from the [[Migration Period]] to the level of the French and British epics, producing the [[Nibelungenlied]]. There was also a quantity of poetry and historical writings which were written during this period, such as ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]].\n\nDespite political decline during the late 12th and much of the 13th centuries, the Byzantine scholarly tradition remained particularly fruitful over the time period. One of the most prominent philosophers of the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]], reinvigorated [[Neoplatonism]] on Christian foundations and bolstered the study of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient philosophical texts]], along with contributing to history, grammar, and rhetorics. His pupil and successor at the head of Philosophy at the [[University of Constantinople]] [[John Italus|Ioannes Italos]] continued the Platonic line in Byzantine thought and was criticized by the Church for holding opinions it considered heretical, such as the doctrine of [[Reincarnation|transmigration]]. Two Orthodox theologians important in the dialogue between the eastern and western churches were [[Nikephoros Blemmydes]] and [[Maximus Planudes]]. Byzantine historical tradition also flourished with the works of the brothers [[Niketas Choniates|Niketas]] and [[Michael Choniates]] in the beginning of the 13th century and [[George Akropolites]] a generation later. Dating from 12th century Byzantine Empire is also [[Timarion]], an Orthodox Christian anticipation of [[Divine Comedy]]. Around the same time the so-called [[Byzantine novel]] rose in popularity with its synthesis of ancient pagan and contemporaneous Christian themes.\n\nAt the same time southern France gave birth to [[Occitan literature]], which is best known for [[troubadour]]s who sang of [[courtly love]]. It included elements from Latin literature and Arab-influenced Spain and North Africa. Later its influence spread to several cultures in Western Europe, notably in Portugal and the Minnes\u00e4nger in Germany. Proven\u00e7al literature also reached Sicily and Northern Italy laying the foundation of the [[Dolce Stil Nuovo|\"sweet new style\"]] of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and later [[Petrarch|Petrarca]]. Indeed, the most important poem of the [[Late Middle Ages]], the allegorical ''[[Divine Comedy]],'' is to a large degree a product of both the [[Summa Theologica|theology of Thomas Aquinas]] and the largely secular Occitan literature.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Medieval music}}\n[[File:Vihuela de arco y vihuela de p\u00e9\u00f1ola en las Cantigas.jpg|thumb|Musicians playing the Spanish ''[[vihuela]]'', one with a bow, the other plucked by hand, in the ''[[Cantigas de Santa Maria]]'' of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], 13th century]]\n[[File:Organistrum Orense 200708.jpg|thumb|Men playing the [[organistrum]], from the [[Ourense Cathedral]], Spain, 12th century]]\nThe surviving music of the High Middle Ages is primarily religious in nature, since [[music notation]] developed in religious institutions, and the application of notation to secular music was a later development. Early in the period, [[Gregorian chant]] was the dominant form of church music; other forms, beginning with [[organum]], and later including [[Clausula (music)|clausula]]e, [[conductus]], and the [[motet]], developed using the chant as source material.\n\nDuring the 11th century, [[Guido of Arezzo]] was one of the first to develop musical notation, which made it easier for singers to remember Gregorian chants.\n\nIt was during the 12th and 13th centuries that Gregorian plainchant gave birth to polyphony, which appeared in the works of French [[Notre Dame School]] ([[L\u00e9onin]] and [[P\u00e9rotin]]). Later it evolved into the ''[[ars nova]]'' ([[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]]) and the musical genres of late Middle Ages. An important composer during the 12th century was the [[nun]] [[Hildegard of Bingen]].\n\nThe most significant secular movement was that of the [[troubadour]]s, who arose in [[Occitania]] (Southern France) in the late 11th century. The troubadours were often [[itinerant entertainer|itinerant]], came from all classes of society, and wrote songs on a variety of topics, though with a particular focus on [[courtly love]]. Their style went on to influence the [[trouv\u00e8re]]s of northern France, the [[minnesinger]]s of Germany, and the composers of secular [[music of the Trecento]] in northern Italy.\n\n===Theatre===\n{{Main|Medieval theatre}}\nEconomic and political changes in the High Middle Ages led to the formation of  [[guilds]] and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the [[Last Supper]].<ref>''A History of English literature for Students'', by Robert Huntington Fletcher, 1916: pp. 85\u201388</ref>  In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular [[Mystery plays]] were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages.

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]--and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J.|title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History|publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820|isbn=978-1-84631-635-7|pages=192}}</ref> \n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament which, having refused every call for reform, \"they had in any case little cause to lament.\"<ref>Connolly (2012), p. 292</ref> The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute. It was made more so by the reality that in the greater part of country the only element around which the movement could reliably build was the Catholic clergy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=The Politicisation of the Irish Catholic Bishops 1800-1850 |journal=The Historical Journal|date=1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201353|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638467?seq=1}}</ref>\n\n===Protestant unity and the New Reformation===\n\n[[Image:Protestant Unity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1899 penny print of Henry Cooke's 1841 speech in \"reply to Daniel O'Connell\"]]\nIn an incident celebrated by unionists, in 1841, disdaining to engage a \"bully . . . the Cock of the North,\" O\u2019Connell refused the challenge of the then Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], to debate Repeal in Belfast.\n<blockquote>Look at the town of Belfast.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

They continued to baulk at the Ascendancy's high [[Tory]] politics and patronage of the Orange Order. With other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]], at election Presbyterians tended to favour [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] (notwithstanding their dalliance with O'Connell) or, as they later emerged tenant-rights [[Liberal Party|Liberals]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ulster Liberalism|last = Hall|first = Gerald|publisher = Four Courts Press|year = 2011|location = Dublin|isbn= 978-1-84682-202-5}}</ref> But Cooke's \u201cmarriage banns\u201d were \u201ca portent of the future.\u201d  Their call for a pan-Protestant alliance resonated from the moment it was clear that nationalists, where they had failed to persuade in Ulster, were beginning to succeed in England.\n\n===The Irish party challenge at Westminster===\n[[File:Gladstone and Land League.jpg|thumb|William Gladstone writing legislation under pressure from the Land League. Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''.

Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J.

Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. Determined lobbying by her North of Ireland Women's Suffrage Society ensured the 1887 Act creating a new municipal franchise for Belfast--a city in which, thanks to their employment linen and tobacco mills, women predominated--conferred the vote on \"persons\" rather than men.

But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland.

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . .

Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy.

Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]].

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]], <ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital.

Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics. He had been one of the founders of [[Ulster Protestant Action]] (UPA).

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. As a party that \"has its origins in the civil rights movement\", Hume's [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) maintained that it had \"been a consistent voice [often the solitary voice] calling for effective protection of the human rights of all.\"<ref>SDLP (2001), ''A Bill of Rights for All of US: Submission to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Commission on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland'', SDLP Policy Paers, p. 1</ref> As the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] had begun to explore a negotiated settlement with the British government, they too had laid claim to the civil rights legacy. Already in the mid-1980s [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] President [[Gerry Adams]] was pointing to the involvement of the [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolf Tone Clubs]] in [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]], and arguing that human rights had always been an integral part of the republican struggle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Irish Freedom |last=Adams |first=Gerry |year=1986 |publisher=Brandon Books|isbn=0863220843 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nGiven that it appears to extenuate the republican resort to terrorism, Unionists have tended to reject the civil-rights account of the Troubles in almost every particular. in the late 1960s [[Ian Paisley|Paisley]] was not alone is dismissing talk of civil rights as much \"cant\" behind which stood preparations for a renewed armed campaign. There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days: The Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThere were other calculations in an initiative that, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, had the potential to deflect criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> but in 1985 the British government appeared to reverse tack. With the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that projected not rolling devolution but a rolling Irish Dimension. An [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and this Conference would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself. Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained, however, only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to limit Dublin's influence, the suggestion was that they would have to climb down from their insistence of \"simple majority rule\" and think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aughey|first=Arthur|year=1989|title= Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement|location=Belfast|publisher= Blacksaff Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulster Says No poster.svg|100px|left|Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement]]\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=2 June 2019}} [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).

This had been the argument of the [[British and Irish Communist Organisation]] (B&ICO), a small group that coalesced around contrarian commentary of [[Brendan Clifford]], and who had come to the attention of unionists through their critical--and in left-wing circles, unheard of--support for the UWC Strike in 1974<ref>Clifford (1992), pp. 60-62</ref> and for the subsequent 1977 stoppage, the \"Paisley strike\".<ref>Coulter (2015) pp. 487-489</ref>\n\nIn 1977 the B&ICO helped mount the Campaign for Labour Representation in Northern Ireland (CLRNI).

However, a significant number of Protestants have adhered to the nationalist cause, and likewise with Catholics and unionism. These phenomena continue to exist in Northern Ireland.\n\nBoth unionism and nationalism have had sectarian and anti-sectarian elements. While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.

The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]]--and by \"the terrifying speed\" with which peasant insurrection in the South had degenerated into attacks upon Protestants.<ref>{{cite book |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |editor-last=Connolly |editor-first=S.J.|title=Belfast 400: People, Place  and History|publisher=Liverpool University Press |date=2012 |chapter=Chapter 5: Improving Town, 1750-1820|isbn=978-1-84631-635-7|pages=192}}</ref> \n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon.

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first acts of Northern Ireland legislature was to scrap [[proportional representation]] (PR), prescribed for all Irish elections 1919. Preference voting was seen as having assisted nationalists to the control of a large number of local and district councils including, in a \"blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]], <ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref> authorities which then pledged themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement (which had displaced Unionist councillors in Belfast) was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen. A 1922 Special Powers Act gave the Northern Ireland Home Affairs Minister discretionary powers to direct the RUC and Specials as his agents in searches, arrests, detentions, and proscriptions.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref> \n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126-129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy. Speaking to Labour MPs in London, [[John Hume]] suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

Palgrave Macmillan, 2002. p.56</ref> \n\nNot only for the Paisleyites but for many within his own party O'Neills \"policy of treachery\" was confirmed when in December 1968 he sacked his hard-line Minister of Home Affairs, [[William Craig (Northern Ireland politician)|William Craig]] and proceeded with a reform package that addressed many of NICRA's demands. There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more.

There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThere were other calculations in an initiative that, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, had the potential to deflect criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> but in 1985 the British government appeared to reverse tack.

Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained, however, only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to limit Dublin's influence, the suggestion was that they would have to climb down from their insistence of \"simple majority rule\" and think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aughey|first=Arthur|year=1989|title= Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement|location=Belfast|publisher= Blacksaff Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulster Says No poster.svg|100px|left|Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement]]\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=2 June 2019}} [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).

The aim had to be the integration of Northern Ireland into the party political System which determines the government of the United Kingdom. and reversing the Labour Party's policy of deference to Irish \"sister\" parties (since 1970 to the SDLP), was the key to that possibility. This had been the argument of the [[British and Irish Communist Organisation]] (B&ICO), a small group that coalesced around contrarian commentary of [[Brendan Clifford]], and who had come to the attention of unionists through their critical--and in left-wing circles, unheard of--support for the UWC Strike in 1974<ref>Clifford (1992), pp. 60-62</ref> and for the subsequent 1977 stoppage, the \"Paisley strike\".<ref>Coulter (2015) pp. 487-489</ref>\n\nIn 1977 the B&ICO helped mount the Campaign for Labour Representation in Northern Ireland (CLRNI).

Party]] led by [[Arlene Foster]], followed by the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] led by [[Robin Swann]]. Both parties are active across [[Northern Ireland]]. On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989.

While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.
