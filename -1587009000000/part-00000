Rather than submit to their demands, she severed all connections to Buddhist organizations, abandoned the traditional robe, grew out her hair, dressed fashionably, and set out to create her own independent group.<ref name=eichman/>\n\nCurrently, Hai doesn't operate under the guise of traditional Buddhism. Her home page calls her ''Supreme Master Ching Hai, a renowned humanitarian, artist, and spiritual leader'' (lingxing daoshi \u69d7\u32b6\u2e9d\u30ba).

Accusations of being a [[Cult]] group have been made repeatedly over the years, especially in newspaper articles and by cult watchers. Ching Hai\u2019s response to this accusation is that participants were free to leave at any time.<ref name=eichman/> \n\nIn Eichman's own view, as infuriating as Hai's persona, her materialism and unsystematic religious synthesizing is to the Taiwanese Buddhist community and to others who have called her a cult leader, when we set aside her Buddhist roots and compare her work to that of an ever-changing array of self-made gurus, spiritual guides and newly formed religions that make up the New Age marketplace, it becomes evident that Ching Hai\u2019s work is neither the most radical nor innovative. She states that the controversies swirling around Hai should not stop us from noting just how gutsy it was for her to strike out on her own, and with her unusual prominence as a female spiritual leader, Ching Hai in effect demonstrates her ability to compete in a spiritual arena dominated largely by men. And we should be open to the idea that not all female leaders will remain within the religious mainstream.<ref name=eichman/>\n\n==Quan Yin method==\nHai first demonstrated the \"Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation\" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan.<ref name=thornton08/> According to Hai \"The method is transmitted without words... In fact, it isn't really a method. It's the [[Adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na|power of the Master]]. If you have it, then you can transmit it. The Method is a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] one that cannot be described by our language.

This method has existed since the beginning of time, when the universe was first formed. And it will always exist. It is not a method; it is like the way of the universe, a universal law that we must follow if we want to get back to the Origin, back to our [[Original face|true Self]], back to the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] or our [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quan Yin Method is an Eternal Universal Law |url=http://magazine.godsdirectcontact.net/english/178/mt_0.htm |website=magazine.godsdirectcontact.net |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe method involves meditation on the \"inner light and the inner sound\" of God or the Buddha. Hai claims that the [[Bible]] acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions.<ref name=\"young\"/> The Quan Yin Method \"Full Initiation\" involves a life-long commitment to a [[vegan]] diet, adherence to the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] and at least two hours meditation daily. \"Quick initiation\" or \"Convenient Method\", requires a half hour\u2019s meditation daily and abstinence from meat for ten days each month.<ref name=hughes/>\n\n[[Religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] includes Ching Hai in the Indian [[Sant Mat]] tradition, where the method is called [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]. While adhering to formless devotion ([[Para_Brahman#Advaita_Vedanta_-_Nirguna_Brahman|Nirguna Brahman]]), the initiation of the method from a lineage guru or master is paramount.<ref>{{cite book |last1=York |first1=Michael |title=Pagan Mysticism: Paganism as a World Religion |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-2308-1 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CgR_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22ching+hai%22#v=onepage&q=%22ching%20hai%22&f=false |accessdate=3 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nReligious studies scholar Jennifer Eichman notes that this particular meditation method is not part of the standard Buddhist repertoire. Hai's modified synthesis of the method is primarily in Christian-Buddhist jargon with a sprinkling of Hindu ideas. Ching Hai is more likely to cite the Bible than Hindu texts. Ching Hai claims, following standard [[Zen]] doctrine, that everyone is the Buddha; they simply need to realize this fact. In a departure from Christian doctrine, Ching Hai claims that God is not the creator of humans; rather [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] accumulation is responsible for the repeated transmigration of the soul.<ref name=eichman>{{cite journal |last1=Eichman |first1=Jennifer |title=Prominent Nuns: Influential Taiwanese Voices |journal=[[CrossCurrents]] |date=2011 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013373 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1388514 |accessdate=4 February 2020 |language=en |issn=0011-1953|doi=10.1111/j.1939-3881.2011.00187.x }}</ref>\n\nKorean [[Brain & Body|Dahnhak]] [[Qigong]] expert Kim Tae-young, auther of the popular ''Leading Experience'' guidebooks (in Korean) - published in 102 volumes since 1990,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Sung-Man |title=Caring for the Body and Minds (originally in Korean) |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=ko&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fm.skyedaily.com%2Fnews_view.html%3FID%3D8584 |accessdate=7 February 2020 |publisher=SkyeDaily.com |date=24 February 2013}}</ref> has written in ''Leading Experience'' vol 37 (1997) that ''Quan Chi'' (concentrating on [[Qi|Chi]]) and ''Quan Nian'', (observing [[Concept|conceptions]]) are more familiar terms than the term ''Quan Yin'' (observation of the inner vibration).

Accusations of being a [[Cult]] group have been made repeatedly over the years, especially in newspaper articles and by cult watchers. Ching Hai\u2019s response to this accusation is that participants were free to leave at any time.<ref name=eichman/> \n\nIn Eichman's own view, as infuriating as Hai's persona, her materialism and unsystematic religious synthesizing is to the Taiwanese Buddhist community and to others who have called her a cult leader, when we set aside her Buddhist roots and compare her work to that of an ever-changing array of self-made gurus, spiritual guides and newly formed religions that make up the New Age marketplace, it becomes evident that Ching Hai\u2019s work is neither the most radical nor innovative. She states that the controversies swirling around Hai should not stop us from noting just how gutsy it was for her to strike out on her own, and with her unusual prominence as a female spiritual leader, Ching Hai in effect demonstrates her ability to compete in a spiritual arena dominated largely by men. And we should be open to the idea that not all female leaders will remain within the religious mainstream.<ref name=eichman/>\n\n==Quan Yin method==\nHai first demonstrated the \"Immeasurable Light Meditation Center and the Way of Sound Contemplation\" or Quan Yin method of meditation in Miaoli, Taiwan.<ref name=thornton08/> According to Hai \"The method is transmitted without words... In fact, it isn't really a method. It's the [[Adhi\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101na|power of the Master]]. If you have it, then you can transmit it. The Method is a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] one that cannot be described by our language.

This method has existed since the beginning of time, when the universe was first formed. And it will always exist. It is not a method; it is like the way of the universe, a universal law that we must follow if we want to get back to the Origin, back to our [[Original face|true Self]], back to the [[Kingship and kingdom of God|Kingdom of God]] or our [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Quan Yin Method is an Eternal Universal Law |url=http://magazine.godsdirectcontact.net/english/178/mt_0.htm |website=magazine.godsdirectcontact.net |accessdate=7 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe method involves meditation on the \"inner light and the inner sound\" of God or the Buddha. Hai claims that the [[Bible]] acknowledged the existence of this method and that it has been repeatedly re-used by most major religions.<ref name=\"young\"/> The Quan Yin Method \"Full Initiation\" involves a life-long commitment to a [[vegan]] diet, adherence to the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] and at least two hours meditation daily. \"Quick initiation\" or \"Convenient Method\", requires a half hour\u2019s meditation daily and abstinence from meat for ten days each month.<ref name=hughes/>\n\n[[Religious studies]] scholar [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] includes Ching Hai in the Indian [[Sant Mat]] tradition, where the method is called [[Surat Shabd Yoga]]. While adhering to formless devotion ([[Para_Brahman#Advaita_Vedanta_-_Nirguna_Brahman|Nirguna Brahman]]), the initiation of the method from a lineage guru or master is paramount.<ref>{{cite book |last1=York |first1=Michael |title=Pagan Mysticism: Paganism as a World Religion |date=2018 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |isbn=978-1-5275-2308-1 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CgR_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22ching+hai%22#v=onepage&q=%22ching%20hai%22&f=false |accessdate=3 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  \n\nReligious studies scholar Jennifer Eichman notes that this particular meditation method is not part of the standard Buddhist repertoire. Hai's modified synthesis of the method is primarily in Christian-Buddhist jargon with a sprinkling of Hindu ideas. Ching Hai is more likely to cite the Bible than Hindu texts. Ching Hai claims, following standard [[Zen]] doctrine, that everyone is the Buddha; they simply need to realize this fact. In a departure from Christian doctrine, Ching Hai claims that God is not the creator of humans; rather [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] accumulation is responsible for the repeated transmigration of the soul.<ref name=eichman>{{cite journal |last1=Eichman |first1=Jennifer |title=Prominent Nuns: Influential Taiwanese Voices |journal=[[CrossCurrents]] |date=2011 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013373 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1388514 |accessdate=4 February 2020 |language=en |issn=0011-1953|doi=10.1111/j.1939-3881.2011.00187.x }}</ref>\n\nKorean [[Brain & Body|Dahnhak]] [[Qigong]] expert Kim Tae-young, auther of the popular ''Leading Experience'' guidebooks (in Korean) - published in 102 volumes since 1990,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Sung-Man |title=Caring for the Body and Minds (originally in Korean) |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=ko&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fm.skyedaily.com%2Fnews_view.html%3FID%3D8584 |accessdate=7 February 2020 |publisher=SkyeDaily.com |date=24 February 2013}}</ref> has written in ''Leading Experience'' vol 37 (1997) that ''Quan Chi'' (concentrating on [[Qi|Chi]]) and ''Quan Nian'', (observing [[Concept|conceptions]]) are more familiar terms than the term ''Quan Yin'' (observation of the inner vibration).
